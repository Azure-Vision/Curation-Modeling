spacex,removed,a completely unrelated thought i remember back when we were trying to support these giant piles of excrement people were being warned against clicking their ads too many times in quick succession without spending time on the advertisers website because their ad provider might accidentally think that was a bot clicking on those ads and end up banning their advertising account another completely unrelated thought that is also unrelated to the previous unrelated thought i remember back in my younger years playing dumb online games it was pretty easy to modify autoclick scripts to click on certain elements of a website over and over with as much frequency as one wanted im also wondering if choosing to use what i believe to be a verizon cell phone number for contact info on a domain name is really a great idea not that this relates in any way to any topic being discussed also as im just full of unrelated thoughts today and this is definitely unrelated to the previous sentence did you know that if you send an email to vtextcom it comes in as a text message on the cell phone for verizon customers hey you know whats fun random series of numbers thats whats fun like or wow random numbers are really fun did you know theres different ways to arrange numbers that can mean different things like if you lay out a number like this that can be an ip address if you were to try your hardest to flood that ip address with useless packets you might make your computer slow down which would be a ton of fun hey while were on the topic of random numbers know what another fun series of random numbers completely unrelated to anything at all thats a really fun sounding series of random numbers and completely unrelated to anything else ive said or any topic being discussed i know im not a vindictive person that thinks shitty people should have shitty things happen to them and ill bet nobody else is either not that randomly selected numbers and a string of incoherent and unrelated thoughts have anything to do with that just another unrelated thought

spacex,removed,i mean it doesnt even have to be a bullet right as long as were talking about absolutely crazy nonlogical conspiracy theories isnt it at least theoretically nonlogically possible that we could be looking at some kind of microwave weapon some em pulse or other localized directed energy weapon of some kind i mean wouldnt some foreign governments or even extremely talented rogue actors have access to such black market weapons how crazy would that be totally nonfeasible of course and i hate to even bring it up but as long as were going into looney tunes world here why would we assume there has to be a bullet or a rifle involved when a century weapon would be so much harder to track and identify i mean if someone really wanted to cause a lot of fud and also massive impact companies stock prices because of some massive shorts or somethingthey probably have access to more than a rifle wouldnt you think
spacex,removed,or russia cheap space access hurts their soyuz sales
spacex,removed,so lets adjust our tinfoil hats before we dive into this one but what would it look like if the recent amosplosion were an act of sabotage i need to wrap my head around this right now the popping noises heard in the video are presumed to be supersonic gunshots from a saboteur right the bullet would have triggered an explosion in the lox tank on the second stage correct so if sabotage appears the most likely scenario how would they prove it definitively would they involve other governmental investigative agencies once they have enough evidence and of course whodunit and why my head is just swimming i wouldnt be speculating if it werent for the fact that elon hasnt ruled it out and it is the most tempting option to believe that someone else is behind this instead of believing that spacex has messed up and cant figure it out whether or not thats the case does remain to be seen obviously but its therapeutic to least talk about it standard disclaimer mods feel free to remove this post if it is deemed too speculative inflammatory or lowquality
spacex,removed,top ten proofs that aliens exist number will leave you breathless
spacex,removed,wow can we just take a moment and appreciate that a rocket company ceo commented on a reddit post on rspacex
spacex,removed,i think that if i had to guess who would be behind sabotage i wouldnt point a finger at other companies but rather countries like russia
spacex,removed,and the chirp is the dude cracking open a beer
spacex,removed,this is going to be a conspiracy theory but its friday so lets get crazy what are the chances that boeing working in collusion with shadow ops in the pentagon took down that spacex rocket there is certainly motive space x a non military contractor is squeezing boeing a big military contractor very hard on on both government and civilian space faring contracts costing them billions potentially in revenue the pentagon will protect its military assets and military industrial complex in general at all cost the other question is is it possible the answer is how much advanced black budget military technology exists in the black at this time it was not aliens thats crazy baring any internal dysfunction is the possibility i mentioned just as crazy because if its not the whole spacex operation could be in dire jeopardy of being sacrificed on the alter of the us defense industrial complex
spacex,removed,a high powered rifle with an incendiary round fired by the russians to save their entire space industry from being out competed and undercut by spacex and to delay the leading company of commercial crew and keep america reliant on the russians while they make a fresh land grab in the ukraine logical possible and realistic given the thuggish subterfuge if putins government in recent years including annexing a sovereign state by little green men blowing up an airliner full of passengers and conducting clandestine submarine operations at the location of undersea us fiber optic cables dry run to cut them or threaten to do so the scenario of a russian orchestrated sabotage event isnt as preposterous given that elon musk has himself jokingly stated that more than any other risk to himself or spacex people warn him of being an assassination target for putom all of this is unlikely but still more realistic than the scenario you proposed t humour of which was lost on me simply because of the gravity of the this sad situation but lets hope its not ugly sabotage this just seems to be a new failure mode that will take us some time to understand

spacex,removed,im going to be upset if someone sprays graffiti on the rocket
spacex,removed,lurkers unite
spacex,removed,it wouldve been a lot cooler if they had landed the booster there instead of trucking it in
spacex,removed,no i think someone ran up to the rocket and hit it with the back of a high powered rifle
spacex,removed,hey out of curiosity what makes that possibility so absurd we have recorded history of countriescorps doing far more subversive shit remember stuxnet that huge virus the us infected everyone with to slow the iranian nuclear program

spacex,removed,a heavily moded dragon with most of the capacity filled with fuel could possibly do a sample return i think but i havnt done the numbers on how much dv it could have in theory
spacex,removed,no it fucking doesnt you need things for fire ignition oxygen and fuel yes pure oxygen makes a lot of things more flammable but you dont get an explosion with just pure oxygen and no fuel

spacex,removed,if i were to want to see this launch what is the best place for information on getting there best views pricing if applicable and timing to arrive i live a few hours from ksc and i would love to take my son to a launch but theres no info for this launch on kscs website
spacex,removed,yaay what better on my bday than a spacex launch followed by a free grand slam at dennys
spacex,removed,wow what an asshole you are
spacex,removed,if they get the cadence going much faster we are going to need another drone ship i an kind of partial to so much for subtlety or unfortunate conflict of evidence as a minor jab to any of the previous doubters out there
spacex,removed,eh just meet the rocket halfway up

spacex,removed,i know this sounds silly but when i built a very similar craft in kerbal space programclosest parts available i was able to build a diameter craft that could do ssto with about of the fuel left i was blown away it made orbit without the booster while ksp doesnt really represent real life ive never built such a successful ssto until i used the scale of the its lander
spacex,removed,the key is not to spend too much time inside haha
spacex,removed,no im still curious about how well shit on mars s
spacex,removed,ha when my family moved to a new state when i was a kid my mom packed all of our stuff into boxes and my dad loaded all of the boxes into the uhaul then he drove the uhaul then he unloaded all of our boxes of stuff at our new house two of the boxes were way heavier than the others he had a hard time carrying them and wanted to know what was in them but they were taped shut turns out they were full of rocks my mom wanted them for our new yard my dad was pissed haha

spacex,removed,add my snapchat bradwaterfield
spacex,removed,a space race bring it the gleaming domed city of elon will rise out of the martian desert before sls even gets off the ground my prediction nasa will buy a full its system and scrap sls once and for all along with other government white elephants like hydrogen bombs zeppelins and social security
spacex,removed,sounds like a good way to get rid of some boeing execs
spacex,removed,yes
spacex,removed,i prefer elons elongated elonelongategate

spacex,removed,more fake news lets blame russia
spacex,removed,the kremlin
spacex,removed,paywalls are pain
spacex,removed,i cant wait for there to be a space force one
spacex,removed,what concerns me is the possibility i would say even likelihood that dt will try to extort bribes and other illegal costly considerations from musk by holding government contracts hostage hes already doing it to other businesses and foreign governments and corruption makes everything cost a lot more it also raises the danger that ula will simply pay bigger bribes to shut spacex out

spacex,removed,i have some bad news
spacex,removed,thanks
spacex,removed,oh right when tmros on
spacex,removed,oh man i am just upvoting everything i usually dont upboat patch posts but im so nervous and excited everybody knows it but ill say it again this is a big launch for the crew in hawthorne
spacex,removed,ok that sucks but its the weekend so watching it should be a lot easier than sneaking it in during my working day
spacex,removed,thats my birthday even the hour is pretty close come back safe little booster and youll get some cake
spacex,removed,those are some interesting choices for cities to represent their time zones
spacex,removed,i was right
spacex,removed,ok i just moved back to the santa ynez valley a couple days ago and got invited to a private ranch to watch the launch very excited
spacex,removed,now vietnam p
spacex,removed,a bit selfish here but im kinda happy since this is now a saturday afternoon launch for me perfect time to grab a beer and watch the live stream at home
spacex,removed,la la la i cant hear you la la la
spacex,removed,lol the one guy claiming spacex sucks because they cant launch in unreasonable weather
spacex,removed,does anyone know if there will be a live stream available for the launch
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,rapid scheduled disassembly

spacex,removed,oh zoidberg at last youre becoming a crafty consumer
spacex,removed,just dont include any tofu cubes on red dragon and they should be fine right

spacex,removed,esa is toast for launch business outside the eu it will continue to muddle along adjusting to space x inside the region but nothing else ariane six has billion usd development cost before it even flies after the agency is going to charge million now if you apply typical retail mark up it means this rocket will have to fly at least before profit balances development at current pace of eu launch years nice meanwhile space x flies its falcon heavy two years from now this machine booster cores are recovered its upper stage parked in leo for some missions geo its lost raptor engine is added to the upper stage increasing payload beyond tons to leo by cost to a customer million to use fh half that in house raptor single core flies by the time ariane six does this machine lifting tons with its single core but it also will have a super heavy variant able to push plus tons into leo or the same as sls if recovered cost to launch a payload of this size drops to million for a customer but half that or less in house space x starts using its boca chica launch site this place having the added option of placing a launch pad just over the mexican border to avoid washington bureaucrats and the un space treaty given how you can maneuver around such details there boca chica allows several options for landing nonexistent in florida this allows x to drop price even more i contend the esa is dead already more important to people here musk visited the pentagon two days ago why here it is ten years ago it cost a pound to put something into leo musk has this down to of that heading for little as within a few years over the last ten years nasa and other agencies have made huge discoveries about the moon lava tubes water is there tremendous amount of metal scattered all over its surface and rare earths the place is a treasure trove in col trudeau issued a report to the pentagon that there is no technological hurtle that would stop construction of a moon base he pointed out this project was as important to us security as the manhattan project it was shelved by reason nasa estimated cost of this base in excess of billion just for an outpost musk and recent discoveries about the moon have shattered these assumptions not only can a base be built it likely can be done for under billion also robotic tech has reached a point need for a lot of personnel to do big jobs is somewhat negated a base that is self sustaining and from a commercial point even able to generate positive cash flow within years launching stuff from the moon is too expensive you say no sterling of canada answered that contention back in google harp with water and trillions of tons of nickel iron scattered all over a base could fashion a huge cannon even bigger than the one sterling was making for saddam hussien before mossad blew his brains out a cannon able to shoot precious metals all the way back to earth splashing them down in a pacific atoll out of reach of the epa etc a rod able to hit buried military targets but more importantly rolled metal sheet and printer string into lunar orbit where it can be used to fashion space craft of size unfathomable just two years ago i did the math if musk got a pentagon contract secret of course two days ago to help push up components for a moon base what this base could do with twenty personnel living in a lava tube and lots of robots this base could fashion a space craft massing tons with nuke power three means of propulsion hallnext ion and magnetic mass driver able to put tons of supplies on a martin moon or beyond this ship could be flying between and years of the go to build this base space craft that can be armed with lasers by the way sounds far fetched and smug companies like the esa or even ula will laugh at what is proposed here i am not musk has changed parameters and suddenly in the scheme of things has made the impossible possible
spacex,removed,interesting comment however its always the same with you ubitchtitfucker always talking about space dont you have other things to do need i remind you you should be studying for tomorrows exam instead of browsing reddit
spacex,removed,i dont think theres a great need for reddit year old dreamers
spacex,removed,for once sounding like trump is fine with me
spacex,removed,my only worry is it is starting to sound like a trump stump speech its going to be so great you are all going to love it i have my best people working on it i mean it you will be blown away with how great it is make space flight great again
spacex,removed,haha the commenter is my roommate whos studying in the same room as i am and a bit of a duck now and then i guess that wasnt intended for you
spacex,removed,maybe we could get congress to pay for a statue of liberty that orbits earth and reminds everybody not to fight the us
spacex,removed,which looking at in hindsight makes everything theyve achieved since seem draw dropping head scratcher i started to feel bad for ula and esa when the first seadrone attempted failed i always wondered what the first board meeting was like after spacex landed the first stage on falcon flight
spacex,removed,grid fins the size of a basketball court
spacex,removed,we have the best mars transports dont we my nimble navigators
spacex,removed,stickied thread mars signups
spacex,removed,big falcon gridfins
spacex,removed,it was hard to not read that in trumps voice
spacex,removed,the mct is big really big you just wont believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is i mean you may think its a long way down the road to the chemist but thats just peanuts to the mct
spacex,removed,what is the falcon time for to mph how does it compare to the model s in ludicrous mode at about seconds
spacex,removed,is there gonna be an official webcast for this launch normally spacex creates the youtube streams days in advance
spacex,removed,interview with gwynne shotwellhmmm what subtitle can we give that one how about a shot at redemptionthats genius otherwise it was quite a good report
spacex,removed,thanks
spacex,removed,nice
spacex,removed,sorry im too lazy to copy and paste the charts but seems to have done that mods please remove this if it violates our post policies one hundred and thirty nine seconds is all it took for an unmanned rocket to explode after blastoff and turn elon musks booming space exploration technologies corp into a geyser of red ink that june disaster followed by months of launch delays contributed to a quarterbillion dollar annual loss and a drop in revenue after two years of surging sales and small profits the numbers are revealed for the first time in internal financial documents reviewed by the wall street journal the reports and interviews with former spacex employees depict robust growth in new rocketlaunch contracts and a thin bottom line that is vulnerable when things go awry they also show the company putting steep revenue expectations on a nascent satelliteinternet business it hopes will eventually dwarf the rocket division and help finance its goal of manned missions to mars a second explosion during testing on the launchpad in september grounded spacex again adding to losses and causing a fourmonth delay its next launch is planned for saturday when it will seek to regain momentum in the face of depressed revenue jittery customers and a ballooning backlog of delayed missions spacex based in hawthorne calif transformed the aerospace industry with innovative rocket features and silicon valleystyle software design principles mandated by mr musk its billionaire founder and chief executive the company became the first american firm in years to compete for commercial launch contracts and the first company to launch and return a spacecraft from orbit spacex declined to comment on details of its finances but said it has a solid record of success and strong customer relationships we have more than future launches on our manifest representing over billion in contracts said spacex chief financial officer bret johnson the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth adding it has over billion of cash and no debt the journal reviewed spacexs financial results from through the end of as well as forecasts through the next decade as a private company spacex isnt obligated to publicly disclose the figures and the information has never been widely shared mr musk who owns of spacex and holds of company votes has said he isnt interested in going public until the company is able to transport humans to mars which he has said he hopes will happen in to reach the red planet spacex would need to develop a rocket many times more powerful than its fourthgeneration model which hasnt flown and is four years behind schedule spacex projected the satelliteinternet business would have over million subscribers and bring in more than billion in revenue by according to the documents the internet service is currently in planning stages without a factory or a fullfledged team of engineers according to industry officials and earlier comments by company president gwynne shotwell spacexs rocket business has struggled to pull off consistent launches from to june it managed successful launches in a row before its first accident versus more than straight so far by its main us rival a joint venture between boeing co and lockheed martin corp and more than successful consecutive liftoffs for europes arianespace sa spacex delivered small operating profits in and as revenue jumped to billion from million thanks to contracts from nasa and commercial satellite operators the company lost million in when one of its falcon rockets carrying two tons of cargo to the international space station exploded shortly after liftoff the accident thwarted spacexs plans to launch more than a dozen rockets that year instead it launched six the disruptions have led some customers to look for alternatives last year satellite operators inmarsat plc and viasat inc each shifted one spacex launch to arianespace citing the delays although they both retain slots on later missions nasa is conducting a safety review of plans to have spacex carry astronauts into orbit spacex has said it was committed to working with nasa to resolve safety issues before starting manned launches mr musk targeted launches for this year despite having never managed more than eight in a year by he projected spacex will launch or one a week according to the documents spacex is building a new spaceport near brownsville texas expected to host its first launch in to help address its backlog and get its planned internet business rolling mr musk who also runs tesla motors inc created spacex in to reliably launch satellites and other spacecraft at a low cost historically considered contradictory goals in the rocket industry to do so he developed a steady stream of booster upgrades that have pushed technology and reduced the price of putting cargo in orbit spacex phases in significant changes as they become ready rather than following the industry standard of waiting for a fully overhauled design this iterative approach is typical in silicon valley where software companies quickly roll out new features and fix bugs spacex says it lowers costs and improves efficiency unlike most rocket makers that rely on suppliers spacex manufactures and assembles more than of its rocket parts to help keep costs lower spacexs roughly million launch fee for falcon is onequarter to onehalf of what the boeinglockheed venture typically charges enticed by lower prices the worlds largest commercial satellite operators endorsed spacexs approach by plunking down hefty deposits for future launches the falcon had a mostly flawless record delivering payloads to space until the june accident spacexs success enticed alphabet inc and fidelity investments to invest a total of billion in early valuing spacex at billion and mr musks stake at over billion fidelity has since marked up its stake to a price implying a valuation over billion more than double the market cap of publicly traded satellite and rocket company orbital atk inc which has about four times the annual revenue by the summer of spacex teams looked forward to the maiden flight of its fourthgeneration rocket the falcon heavy a bulkedup version of the falcon but the explosion that june of a falcon temporarily grounded flights the company determined the culprit was a long strut or lowtech metal support structure that hadnt been properly inspected the company spent six months in a revamp of qualitycontrol checks and companywide safety procedures the second accident last fall destroyed a million commercial satellite and ratcheted up nasas concerns the cause was attributed to problems with new fueling procedures related to spacexs decision to use colder fuel to boost power the financial documents show spacex had a strong balance sheet to withstand the first explosion sitting on billion in cash at the end of thanks partly to the alphabet and fidelity investments as well as huge upfront payments for development work and launch reservations yet the cash generated by the business was less than the amount invested back into it a longstanding phrase on spacexs website said it was profitable and cashflow positive the internal financial documents reviewed by the journal contradict that statement for the report shows an operating loss every quarter and also negative cash flow of roughly million three weeks after the september accident spacex removed the phrase from its website suggesting both profit and cash flow had moved into the red for senior spacex officials havent made public statements about the companys profitability spacex forecast it would have billion in revenue and million in operating profit in according to the documents which were prepared in early those targets are unlikely to have been met because the company only launched eight rockets instead of its planned just two more than when revenue was million using the investment from alphabet spacex plans to eventually launch its own constellation of over communications satellites—about times the size of any current communications array—to provide global internet access forecasting the first phase to go online by according to the documents the company expects revenue from the satellite business to overtake spacexs core launch division by and by to generate an operating profit of between billion and billion according to the documents spacexs rocketlaunch business competes in an industry that produces only billion in total annual revenue according to carissa christensen chief executive of consulting firm tauri space and technology potential profits of the internet service could help justify spacexs huge valuation rival oneweb ltd of arlington va is ahead on its plan to provide internet service from more than satellites oneweb which has priority rights internationally to radio frequencies needed to deliver internet signals last month raised billion from japans softbank group and is already lining up suppliers and building a factory in florida to make its satellites
spacex,removed,nobody cares
spacex,removed,rocket surgery is so tricky
spacex,removed,does the fourleaf clover represent jrti or is it just generally for good luck
spacex,removed,rfoundtheprogrammer
spacex,removed,and finally theres the hydrobraking option which when applied judiciously can provide much better results than lithobraking
spacex,removed,you made me imagine a future where a group of people would take spacex as a religion elon as their prophet and mars as heavens totally opposed to spacex proscience culture of course i feel this comment will be removed for being low effort low quality low latitude or something but hey why not try to communicate
spacex,removed,you think this guy could fit a megawatt grid on his vacation cabin
spacex,removed,hopefully your sister is just thinking theyve already landed what cores itll take at least a falcon heavy to get me excited
spacex,removed,they can email the potus if their hotels are attacked again
spacex,removed,ncc when do we start naming boosters names
spacex,removed,dont jinks it
spacex,removed,if they land that thing it needs to be in a museum
spacex,removed,i like where your head is at
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,wet
spacex,removed,i hope someone can share an mirror image i am an phone user
spacex,removed,just as soon as they get that unicorn problem cleared up
spacex,removed,had a clearly visible in a closeup shot at about in the webcast so maybe it was first with a serial number painted near the octoweb
spacex,removed,donald j trump will want to unhitch the earth monitoring satelite and replace it with a moon lander perhaps with a couch tailormade for newt gingrich
spacex,removed,im about to google acronym
spacex,removed,hey its me ur falcon
spacex,removed,you could ask him to marry you that way hell always be around s
spacex,removed,i think it is safe to assume that trump is mostly a business man and really doesnt care about the science itself the question in trumps mind is whether or not we can afford the measures of combating climate change and would they make a difference the united states is not the largest polluter we do have high standards for emissions however these high standards are driving business to the world in order to keep prices labor low the question in the mind of all politicians is whether or not the changes we make are actually effective which seems to be a overwhelming majority of no the changes are not so if the changes are not effective why would we add additional burdens and slow down development which also funds research i think there is a lot of people that just want to yell climate change denier but doesnt want to have a hard discussion on the truth of the matter the world is fucked at any standard so we can go to war to make other submit to our regulations we can put sanctions and cause their people to starve in order to listen to our requirements or we can drastically fun in energy research and hope for the best in the next or so years
spacex,removed,full transcript today the quotes in that article dont really show the same picture as the full transcript its just trump spewing common refrains from climate change deniers but then always following it with i have a totally open mind and weve had storms always you know the hottest day ever was in you dont tend to hear this but there are people on the other side of that issue who are think dont even but a lot of smart people disagree with you im not sure anybody is ever going to really know i know we have they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists it also depends on how much its going to cost our companies we have to make ourselves competitive
spacex,removed,congrats elon keep inspiring us all its kind of what you do
spacex,removed,a bunch of reddit space nerds positing what trump will do about climate change pretty hilarious considering the last year especially last couple of days
spacex,removed,sure hope they let the media in sometime d
spacex,removed,i downvote every link that has an addblock blocker script
spacex,removed,piece of shit
spacex,removed,am i the only one annoyed that they chose fold symmetry when the only viable symmetries are and ksp reference for those uninitiated
spacex,removed,at least its not as bad as waiting for the next game of thrones book over at rasoiaf theyve been waiting for their rtf for years
spacex,removed,holy crap thats cool
spacex,removed,oh rspacex where a rocket is more important than the lives of the people who build it
spacex,removed,is this why musk talked about building tunnels
spacex,removed,there are always some bugs to work out
spacex,removed,as long as they dont put ms frizzle onboard teachers in space doesnt have a great success rate
spacex,removed,the falcon just looks so wrong without landing legs or gridfins
spacex,removed,a big elastic cord that could pull back to do a rtls
spacex,removed,sure i could see nasa looking at that in that way if you know the car has driven down the street once and hasnt exploded and there was no damages during parking they at least know there was no obvious manufacturing problems
spacex,removed,sure i could see nasa looking at that in that way if you know the car has driven down the street once and hasnt exploded and there was no damages during parking they at least know there was no obvious manufacturing problems
spacex,removed,lolo dude you need to please leave your childish tricks to your school b again think bbeforeb your answer
spacex,removed,wow all these things sounds like something out of a sciencefiction book its amazing that these are all valid questions now
spacex,removed,have you ever researched the pricepermb from todays enduser satellite internet providers
spacex,removed,and small fuel factory on titan is a heck of a lot cheaper than launching and assembling gigawatt reactors for every spacecraft you send off simply calculate worst energytime requirements for tons of lox by electricity midschool level on knowledge is sufficient for this
spacex,removed,woo a launch on my birthday would be awesome
spacex,removed,most important new date still has day light launch dont many here want to witness first return to land of booster they can see i know im planning to be at jetty park to witnesssee that history
spacex,removed,isnt the whole point of this sub speculation
spacex,removed,loved it but on nasaspaceflight in they interesting that the fat cat the nasa dit not have a heart attack but is now on a healthy diet and time passing spacex is now more careful of what may offend the now thinner cat is feeding them next thing they may need to rethink the heart of gold name which in fiction is that of a httphitchhikerswikiacomwikiheartofgold
spacex,removed,mods and admins here like to keep everything tidy sometimes too much so its better to have this dialog at rspacexlounge
spacex,removed,i hope to be inside a tesla bus watching rick and morty season and eating some pizzahut in just hope
spacex,removed,block has the reusable fairings payload sorry i could not resist
spacex,removed,its a badass fancy camera
spacex,removed,that would be funny as hell
spacex,removed,shotwell fucking says random shit all the time it seems she has really not been right on anything in the past year
spacex,removed,because it is an expendable launch that will not be landed on the drone ship or rtls
spacex,removed,somebody wake me up when is actually ready for use
spacex,removed,so yet another missed deadline whatever theyre making history i say dont worry about it live your own life and tune in when the rocket launches
spacex,removed,so now not only does elon need to go back and forth from la to sf all the time but also regularly to the east coast thats adding up a lot of time in flight i bet he wished he had high speed internet on his plane really hes mostly busy fixing his own transport problems doesnt like driving builds a selfdriving car wants to go to mars builds a rocket doesnt like traffic tunnels and soon the inflight wifi obviously all very selfish
spacex,removed,even better make the payload a blue origin rocket my rocket can put your rocket into orbit and then land suck it bezos
spacex,removed,i vote for elon musk as elon of mars
spacex,removed,trump
spacex,removed,nonsense havent you ever played dwarf fortress this can only end in fun
spacex,removed,yeah thats great and all but im not going to be impressed until they can bring it back clean it looks terrible covered in soot like that
spacex,removed,i will always refer to him as the elon now
spacex,removed,i was hoping itd be a merlin
spacex,removed,anyone that knows more than me care to explain the coloration on the rocket is it black discoloration from rocket burn whys there a relatively clean section in the middle
spacex,removed,that would be hard but not impossible at least for elon
spacex,removed,i vote they send up the red model prototype from the unveil event
spacex,removed,longer then it is wide my mother used that as a euphemism for male anatomy shed say eat that asparagus its longer than it is wide its good for your ankle duster
spacex,removed,tiamat or gtfo
spacex,removed,the mars door
spacex,removed,they can retire now
spacex,removed,clears throat please merge with the other threads in the recovery thread httpimgurcompkolkvi
spacex,removed,so within a decade we could be seeing regular space convoys travelling through our solar system my dreams of being a space trucker arent looking so outlandish now mom
spacex,removed,from this point of view fuelling her up with a few gallons and flying to the launch pad looks like a good idea almost
spacex,removed,this subreddit keeps reminding me of ironman
spacex,removed,you know this would end up with us all having to call mars the red bull planet
spacex,removed,saw title figured this was rkerbalspaceprogram and someone was doing a spacex reconstruction
spacex,removed,this made me think of deadpool
spacex,removed,ok
spacex,removed,the value of art by definition is given to it by its viewers and creators it just has to express something in this case its national pride technological achievement and the human urge to explore
spacex,removed,i call it the leaning tower of musk
spacex,removed,anyone have a wellinformed guess of how much the fairings cost
spacex,removed,its a slightly off kilter rocket that can leap tall planets in a single bound
spacex,removed,httpsgfycatcompiercingbittergermanspaniel
spacex,removed,park like a boss
spacex,removed,must add that the falcon was very angry when it damaged its leg as evidenced by the fuming smoke coming out of its ears
spacex,removed,first stage recovery now fairing recovery lets wait a little for stage recovery and maybe we will have voltronlike reassable sequence
spacex,removed,the smug exhaust at the very end makes it that is all like perfect landing baby aw yiss 😎
spacex,removed,since theyre already boat shaped why not make them a bit bigger and let the first stage land on them
spacex,removed,so whos going to make the pixelerated sunglasses thing
spacex,removed,if a minute of watching a rocket land exceeds the concentration span of a person i would say that is a clear indication for a medical condition i dont think that is the reason
spacex,removed,this is how you get a job at spacex walk in to the interview with one of you made earlier picture credit steve jurvetson
spacex,removed,what if they will send a dragon capsule to land on the moon i think it may be doable and a great advertisement for space x
spacex,removed,wouldnt it be rockety mcrocket face
spacex,removed,that is just elon paced
spacex,removed,blue origin who
spacex,removed,those are your future robot overlords arguing
spacex,removed,now we just need one of these type of gifs httpiimgurcomfwwfvvagif
spacex,removed,hah it is a bird falcon
spacex,removed,this is so fucking badass
spacex,removed,your explanation is undoubtedly the right one but i cant get the idea out of my mind that the rcs thrusters are the rockets equivalent of jazz hands its like i landed woooooooo
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,sequence of stills right so a video justeditorthings p
spacex,removed,this is just what the ballearthers would have you believe s
spacex,removed,was expecting a reversed gif of the landing
spacex,removed,dear god we build space mauschwitz
spacex,removed,what do you call the mouse shadow on youre second moon
spacex,removed,i writted about it when its was showed nobody care then i just did not match for you guys
spacex,removed,thats some reality tv i would watch
spacex,removed,i am zara
spacex,removed,dont post paywall sites please
spacex,removed,thank you for this
spacex,removed,enlarge elon it took me sometime to understand what this was about
spacex,removed,never say never xd
spacex,removed,you must be tons of fun at parties
spacex,removed,cant find any rocket
spacex,removed,can i buy myself a used falcon
spacex,removed,and there goes all my money
spacex,removed,how much for a geosynch launch
spacex,removed,cant wait to nab a falcon launch for only million
spacex,removed,off an launch ill have to check my checking account balance brb
spacex,removed,i was expecting this to be a joke and that wed see the falcon for off million
spacex,removed,tickets to mars now just
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,thank goodness i can wear giant fat guy sizes p
spacex,removed,i was hoping for off satellite launches
spacex,removed,joke
spacex,removed,at least we are slowly trending closer to launch
spacex,removed,what year is in elon years
spacex,removed,like fusion reactors
spacex,removed,im hoping they send a tesla up there
spacex,removed,sooner or later several suicides of hardcore fans
spacex,removed,i would like mercurian melted cheese
spacex,removed,but if we melted it in zerog would it still separate because then we could have holes and molten cheese
spacex,removed,oh my goodness idk how to explain what a joke is are you an alien lol
spacex,removed,to late i already quoted you muhahaha
spacex,removed,httpstwittercomelonmusk andyoneal sides def center maybe this message was created by a bot
spacex,removed,i agree with this marge the barge cant travel under her own power hahaha hahaha hopefully the governor of florida is making sure the state of florida is getting their fair share in this scam just call in the national guard and there wont be any problem with imperial entanglements mo gold for florida the north dakota model works
spacex,removed,thats cost not price price is what you payso if your spacex is getting gold from outer space for ten million bucks they will charge you much more for the privilege of being on board team elon
spacex,removed,this is a good point tooand by no means am i an expert other than the only thing i see is a rocket and nothing else in other words if someone is getting any good from all this i sure havent noticed itnor is anyone even bothering to post this simple fact in theory this is very impressive indeedbut so far its all just fuel burn and used metal the homeless guy fishing from the peer is providing more economic benefit actually
spacex,removed,whenever i see a tugboat i always think of
spacex,removed,i suspect lkofenglish could be my neighbor who whenever i bring up space in conversation repeats his man has no business in space mantra its become a running joke the neighbor is also a science denier i think its all part of the syndrome he might not be my neighbor though there are millions of them out there
spacex,removed,youre being so scammed thats why its called entertainment dude youre the entertainment
spacex,removed,gps and shit
spacex,removed,they are altering the deal pray they dont alter it any further
spacex,removed,what would you do for your own kids collect welfare
spacex,removed,spacex needs to up its drone ship game id expect something a lot more awesome than a flat barge that needs to be pulled by a tugboat from a musk company
spacex,removed,meh im only going to be impressed when we get autonomous tug boats
spacex,removed,govthugs gonna thug
spacex,removed,you people really will talk about everything smh
spacex,removed,maybe with a words you could
spacex,removed,if spacex named their spacecraft as kraken then we would have a different tweet the kraken has been released
spacex,removed,beat me by seconds
spacex,removed,i do like the irony of you asking a question even though its a pretty relevant question
spacex,removed,just play some strauss in the background and imagine stanley kubrick is filming
spacex,removed,only thousands idve expected the cargo to be worth millions
spacex,removed,splashdown if you lose track of it give me a call in a couple weeks
spacex,removed,im allowed to cringe and bitch about it just as you are allowed to cringe and bitch about my preference granted im just suggesting you make peace with the fluidity of language and come to recognize that the fluidity is a feature and should be celibated
spacex,removed,proper grammar and spelling arent irrelevant youre just wrong that its improper all that matters is that someone is consistent to whatever region they are fromrepresenting so catsup is colored red and ketchup is coloured red are equally correct but catsup is coloured red is wrong
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,why allow saboteurs like bezos and floridas greedy public officials to impede spacexs publicspirited efforts to make rockets reusable and help life outlast earth could spacex boosters be flown from the recovery boat to the hanger via one or more helicopters or dirigibles if space x added a crane to its recovery boat could its boosters be positioned horizontally and loaded aboard a custombuilt hovercraft or amphibious vehicle that could proceed to the space x hanger without having to pay port fees must spacex launch its rockets from foreign soil in order to achieve its noble goal
spacex,removed,short questions are better suited for the ask anything thread when you post questions in the future you should also use a more descriptive title
spacex,removed,or a kayak
spacex,removed,elon musk and spacex are the foremost heroes and even the gods of some highly intelligent and motivated members of this forum and possibly of the worldwide public at large their missions and cause are sacred to us we want to protect them our souls are deeply and permanently scared by those who attack them anyone who attempts to obstruct impede or interfere with them should beware some of us may passively allow our interests to be attacked some of us may express our deep feelings and disapproval via demonstrations permanent boycotts of our enemies products and even via some of the tactics that have been used by radical islam to conquer others homelands and spread their alien religion via terrorism etc
spacex,removed,create hovercraft version
spacex,removed,ahmen
spacex,removed,ooohhhnoooonot musl probably
spacex,removed,angry useless lazy union worker spotted
spacex,removed,not explode just a very fast augmentation
spacex,removed,still not astronomical buhdumtish
spacex,removed,sorry but who is he
spacex,removed,maybe they forgot the rocket d
spacex,removed,who
spacex,removed,hot damn
spacex,removed,keep em coming
spacex,removed,more pics from twitter
spacex,removed,the fact that he was being serious makes my brain cells cry
spacex,removed,this stage feels so close to its home
spacex,removed,ah how many boosters have we recovered what are we doing with those then
spacex,removed,i dont know why but i laughed when i saw that thing just laying in the road like it fell out of the back of someones pickup truck
spacex,removed,she is a beauty 😍
spacex,removed,vanity project and a waste of tax payers money people are starving in chicago god damn it
spacex,removed,welcome to the future
spacex,removed,pun intended
spacex,removed,fk
spacex,removed,come on elonwe need you to save the us
spacex,removed,i wonder if they privately call it rtfm
spacex,removed,can you imagine after all that success if it then got dropped by the crane 😦
spacex,removed,dont criticize the life choices try dropping through the atmosphere from going over km per second and see how you look
spacex,removed,there were a lot of things we couldnt do in an but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact people often asked us if because of this fact it was fun to fly the jet fun would not be the first word i would use to describe flying this plane intense maybe even cerebral but there was one day in our sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there at least for a moment it occurred when walt and i were flying our final training sortie we needed hours in the jet to complete our training and attain mission ready status somewhere over colorado we had passed the century mark we had made the turn in arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly my gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months ripping across the barren deserts feet below us i could already see the coast of california from the arizona border i was finally after many humbling months of simulators and study ahead of the jet i was beginning to feel a bit sorry for walter in the back seat there he was with no really good view of the incredible sights before us tasked with monitoring four different radios this was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital it had been difficult too for me to relinquish control of the radios as during my entire flying career i had controlled my own transmissions but it was part of the division of duties in this plane and i had adjusted to it i still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground however walt was so good at many things but he couldnt match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading he understood that and allowed me that luxury just to get a sense of what walt had to contend with i pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him the predominant radio chatter was from los angeles center far below us controlling daily traffic in their sector while they had us on their scope albeit briefly we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace we listened as the shaky voice of a lone cessna pilot asked center for a readout of his ground speed center replied november charlie im showing you at ninety knots on the ground now the thing to understand about center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a cessna or to air force one they always spoke in the exact same calm deep professional tone that made one feel important i referred to it as the houston center voice i have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this countrys space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the houston controllers that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did and it didnt matter what sector of the country we would be flying in it always seemed like the same guy was talking over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere conversely over the years pilots always wanted to ensure that when transmitting they sounded like chuck yeager or at least like john wayne better to die than sound bad on the radios just moments after the cessnas inquiry a twin beech piped up on frequency in a rather superior tone asking for his ground speed i have you at one hundred and twentyfive knots of ground speed boy i thought the beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his cessna brethren then out of the blue a navy pilot out of nas lemoore came up on frequency you knew right away it was a navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios center dusty ground speed check before center could reply im thinking to myself hey dusty has a ground speed indicator in that milliondollar cockpit so why is he asking center for a readout then i got it ol dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from mount whitney to the mojave knows what true speed is hes the fastest dude in the valley today and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new hornet and the reply always with that same calm voice with more distinct alliteration than emotion dusty center we have you at on the ground and i thought to myself is this a ripe situation or what as my hand instinctively reached for the mic button i had to remind myself that walt was in control of the radios still i thought it must be done – in mere seconds well be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost that hornet must die and die now i thought about all of our sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming i was torn somewhere miles above arizona there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet then i heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat that was the very moment that i knew walter and i had become a crew very professionally and with no emotion walter spoke los angeles center aspen can you give us a ground speed check there was no hesitation and the replay came as if was an everyday request aspen i show you at one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo knots across the ground i think it was the fortytwo knots that i liked the best so accurate and proud was center to deliver that information without hesitation and you just knew he was smiling but the precise point at which i knew that walt and i were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say in his most fighterpilotlike voice ah center much thanks were showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money for a moment walter was a god and we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the houston center voice when lacame back with roger that aspen your equipment is probably more accurate than ours you boys have a good one it all had lasted for just moments but in that short memorable sprint across the southwest the navy had been flamed all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the king of speed and more importantly walter and i had crossed the threshold of being a crew a fine days work we never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast for just one day it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there

spacex,removed,i think he wanted to ask what degree he did and kinda slipped some words
spacex,removed,they could go with turbocold or to fit within musks universe crank the cold up to

spacex,removed,there were rumors ive never witnessed such a thing on the internet

spacex,removed,december launch january ya think
spacex,removed,that was the antidroneshipballisticrockets lastditch effort to complete its mission unlike the surrendermonkey full thrust variant the knew their jobs and never stopped trying

spacex,removed,youre not wrong the standard of journalism these days is atrocious even writing basic english seems to be a challenge i guess no grammar is required with cut paste would it be too meta to incorrectly say that your comment is ironic
spacex,removed,zubrin makes an atlength and technical critique of the its with his own counterproposals httpwwwthenewatlantiscompublicationscolonizingmars
spacex,removed,double post minutes apart
spacex,removed,meh just send up a couple of modified space shuttles with some nukes and roughnecks s
spacex,removed,what a pile of nonsense
spacex,removed,its refreshing to finally have a nonidiot in the white house maybe we can do congress next
spacex,removed,congress is so effin worthless
spacex,removed,it would be really funny if this guy was on the team that designed the pipeline and he was being super pig headed when it came to the implementation side of things he then got bitched at by the welders and some team lead for making it such a pain in the ass still he came onto the spacex sub to defend it and instead of seeing the error of his ways blew up straight out of seinfeld or something
spacex,removed,solution give elon a island off the coast of florida one with a volcano make it a unique state not part of the usa then elon can do what it likes for launch
spacex,removed,on the flip side if spacex launches the red dragon without explicit apporval then elon will offically become drum roll please a space pirate of course i think that means the navy can hange him so perhaps they should get apporval first
spacex,removed,clear cut like a nice diamond a space diamond maybe from an asteroid i wonder if elon is keen
spacex,removed,just launch from the caribbean somewhere start stealingerr liberating everything thats of value up there see where the missing ten trillion went if it turns out to be an actual star destroyer flee back to somewhere in the caribbean
spacex,removed,irritated why a helicopter gonna be mash or an osprey or what guys who were somewhat forced into it crews and the critics alltwo or three of them did prove it possible skyhook helicopters dont have lift and they dont have stability and yes some wild crazy motherfuckers can fly them to their limits theres all sorts of wild shit there kiowa pilots stand out i dont think the platform ula spacex wanting their fairings back etcare achievable on a consistent basis
spacex,removed,this just in the moms basement high power amateur rocket society wants to send humans to mars their orbiting laboratory which they expect to launch in weeks will be around earths moon from which they will use telescopes to look longingly at mars orbit to plan out future missions when asked how that was comparable to lockheeds plans a representative replied its as much like actually going to mars orbit as mars orbit is to landing on the surface and you never asked lockheed that question
spacex,removed,haha now im imagining them taking a leaf out of apples book can you imagine the media frenzy if they built the transporter in secret press conference heres the mct oh one more thing were sending people to mars later this afternoon
spacex,removed,space race is back on boys

spacex,removed,im not a republic serial villain do you seriously think id explain my masterstroke if there remained the slightest chance of you affecting its outcome i did it thirtyfive minutes ago
spacex,removed,nasa is best when they are pushing the boundaries they got off track with the space shuttle and became cargoferry service for the space station they need to be doing things like sending probes to europa and other exotic things i think a mission to mars is also a good thing for them to focus on commercial industry is not as well suited for a manned mission they could be involved in other things like like sending cargo i think the most viable and safest way for a manned mission is to send unmanned infrastructure first so orbiting habitat andor ground based habitat that we know will be there for them when they arrive
spacex,removed,let me guess you are a bernie voter no regard for taxpayer costs and wasted money a total disregard of incentivising and disincentivizing consumer behavior and zero understanding of basic economic principles such as opportunity cost if we had given musk the money for the senate launch system we would already have a permanent base on mars and multiple companies would already be returning rare earths and other goodies from the asteroid belt all that money nasa spends on the senate launch system is money we could spend elsewhere and yes somebody really does have to pay for it and no it is not infinite
spacex,removed,more like first mct launching in minutes first tickets for free
spacex,removed,look on bright side i heard nato countries could be at war with russia in the baltic states next year maybe nasa could ask for a discount
spacex,removed,hey cheer up it could be worse your parents could have named you millicent
spacex,removed,the s was designed from the beginning to be an exceptional luxury car so its not surprising that it is expensive go read master plan part un the model s was supposed to be cheaper to make half the price of a roadster blah blah blah didnt happen the was designed to be low cost and easy to manufacture they are planning half a million a year in and a million of them per year in those are great claims the last claims elon has made with respect to tesla are false as per the wsj he has never once made a production target and half a million in isnt happening he is only ahead of schedule because he hasnt gotten to any milestone big enough to keep him honest yet
spacex,removed,i have one questionwill the mct have nuclear power systems i feel like thats vague enough that you could answer it and not get firedbut by all means run it by mgmnt first i wouldnt want ot get you in any trouble

spacex,removed,flatearthers be like ugh umm thats cgi
spacex,removed,man russians dont even have a russian mcdonalds let alone a russian spacex what are you talking about
spacex,removed,dod nasa sls billion almost half of nasas budget is getting spent on a backwards jobs program saturn was built to take man to the moon sls is being built tobe a bigger rocket it has been designed to go to the mars despite what some say because anyone fluent in orbital mechanics and with a clear mind we are talking people who play ksp on hardest with permadeath and all the difficulty mods no not frigging kethane i mean deadly reentry real atmospheric drag real sized solar systems etc anyway they will tell you that to get the best isp to mars you dont want to take excess weight with you its why they left the lunar command module in orbit and this is essentially what buzz aldrin suggested you build a cycler in orbit we actually already have one its called the iss then you boost it into a earth mars cycler orbit ala aldrin cycler then to get to mars you only need to launch a small cramped capsule with people and food and fuel to catchup with the cycler as it swings by earth you can then dock and have lots of room and equipment that can stay up there and undock when in orbit around mars when the argument of we need a bigger rocket to go to mars no you do not the most massy port of the iss is the zarya module essentially a spacious self contained spaceshipcommand center is tonnes the unity modulenode is only tones in comparison thus small enough to be lofted by a falcon thus what a sensible man would care about if they were king of nasa is cost per tonne again spacex wins where so you could build a modular ship in a hanger here on earth pay spacex a part to lob it into leo and dock it once its ready stick some crazy astronauts in it and make it go do a orbit of mars for a laugh so nasa could if they had the balls built a interplanetary spaceship in orbit for less than billion but they wont elon might though he is a clever guy and he looks up to buzz even though buzz made him cry
spacex,removed,im sure hell support it as long as it is branded as the trump mct and he can build one of his tacky resorts on mars
spacex,removed,well always have bigger fish to fry what this country needs is to actually do real things again even if those things are somewhat nonnonsensical like going to the moon they inspire us as a nation creators not just creditors im interested to see how trump plans to make america great again if we just start by being practical and down to earth which has never been the basis of american greatness
spacex,removed,put him
spacex,removed,trump literally says anything required to move a discussion forward or to shyhide from conflict or disagreement with whatever group or person he is speaking with hanging any level of logic or relying on the substance of what he has said with regards to possible future space budgets would be premature at best clinton is to my knowledge the only candidate with any sort of real plan and that real plan includes plenty of space funding

spacex,removed,either you just made the most offensive paragraph ive seen in a while or your score means someone is anyone with a security clearance and a brain or even half of one should know for themselves that she should be in prison already not including what shes been accused of that she hasnt admitted to but there is growing evidence of and you know an herridge said that comey commented on the investigation into hillary clintons private email server reiterating that there is no timeline for the probe to be completed but she asked him whether the bureau is conducting a security inquiry into the server as mrs clinton has called it in an apparent effort to downplay the matter he said to us point blank i dont even know what that means a security inquiry we do investigations here at the fbi herridge said the fact that there is even an argument is appalling shes literally the biggest liar ive ever seen including historical figures shes always httpsenwikipediaorgwikigaslighting always if shes ever right its only for the same reasons a broken clock is not that im remotely fond of trump either in fact im just staying out of politics because my problem with hillary isnt her politics its that shes personally one of the greatest roots of corruption the world has ever seen and an easily proven criminal that only gets away with it because shes corrupted the very system that supposed to prevent that and enforce the law shes human cancer everything she touches dies or becomes a perverse shadow of its former self cough single payer health care cough i dont see how cancer is good for nasa the us anyone or anything she should be in prison and its a profound indictment on our society that she isnt but screw you dude she said nicer things about nasa and payed more people to vote on reddit so youre sol pretty soon your comment wont even be visible httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvijmtvkoahpm

spacex,removed,text of article congressional investigators are raising new safety concerns about space exploration technologies corps plans for future manned launches citing persistent cracking of vital propulsionsystem components according to government and industry officials familiar with the details the government accountability offices preliminary findings reveal a pattern of problems with turbine blades that pump fuel into rocket engines these officials said the final gao report scheduled to be released in coming weeks is slated to be the first public identification of one of the most serious defects affecting falcon rockets the crackprone parts are considered a potentially major threat to rocket safety the industry officials said and may require redesign of what are commonly called the falcon s turbopumps the national aeronautics and space administration they said has warned spacex that such cracks pose an unacceptable risk for manned flights a spacex spokesman didnt have any comment the red flags are appearing as entrepreneur elon musks closely held company has delayed for at least two weeks its first unmanned launch from a newly renovated cape canaveral fla pad pending further tests of ground facilities spacexs initial blastoff from the kennedy space centers pad —a historic site used to launch nasas apollo missions to the moon—is now scheduled no earlier than midfebruary taken together the moves underscore technical and schedule challenges facing southern californiabased spacex as it seeks to accelerate its launch tempo this year the company aims to launch more than double the eight rockets it launched last year to meet commitments to nasa and whittle away at a bulging backlog of delayed commercial missions spacexs internal projections envision ramping up total launches to roughly one a week past the end of the decade including at least a handful of its mostpowerful falcon heavy boosters annually development of the falcon heavy is years behind schedule but spacex hopes to conduct its maiden flight later this year industry officials have known about problems with cracked blades on falcon versions for many months or even years but cracks continued to be found during tests as recently as september robert lightfoot nasas acting administrator confirmed in an interview with the wall street journal earlier this week nasa officials have been briefed on the focus of the gaos preliminary findings mr lightfoot said were talking to about turbo machinery adding that he thinks we know how to fix them in the interview mr lightfoot said he didnt know if the solution would require a potentially timeconsuming switch to bigger turbopumps the final gao report also will to delve into unrelated issues that threaten to delay initial launches of manned capsules by spacex and rival boeing co echoing conclusions of other studies by outside experts gao investigators have determined that both companies are likely to miss a deadline to start regular missions ferrying astronauts to the international space station according to industry officials familiar with the draft report the gao also pinpointed frequent modifications of falcon designs as a potential source of delays in obtaining nasa certification of the booster for boeing these officials said gao investigators—among other items—raised questions about the status of tests to determine the reliability of its parachute systems designed to help returning manned capsules land safely the gao also has determined that both companies face an uphill struggle to meet nasas statistical goal of no more than one projected astronaut fatality in flights industry officials said the turbine issue doesnt appear to be connected to spacexs most recent launch delay the company days ago announced it was temporarily scrubbing the scheduled launch of a commercialcommunications satellite for echostar corp at the time spacex lacked a federal launch license which the company expected to have to permit blastoff from pad on feb spacex said the change allows time for additional testing of ground systems but it didnt elaborate the federal aviation administration which is responsible for issuing launch licenses earlier this week said it is working closely with spacex to ensure the companys application meets all applicable regulations related to protection of public health and safety instead of the echostar satellite spacex intends to launch a nasa cargo mission to the international space station around midfebruary though some nasa officials originally wanted the new pads equipment and performance to be validated with a commercial launch it appears the agency is eager to replenish experiments on the orbiting space station
spacex,removed,dear spacex i write to you to express my humblest reverence for your continued existence in the field i admire so much my university is known for its highquality academic research and i am now choosing my research thesis topic my major is in hospitality events and tourism management i am interested in the future possibilities presented by space tourism and humankind surely the mass migration of people to mars will one day occur in my opinion as well as interplanetary travel it is clear that at present there is little academic literature to review about these topics i would like to make a modest contribution to the development of the industry if you could be so kind to put me in contact with some of the experts in spacex who are engaged in the preparation of these tasks i would be very grateful i would be prepared to work alongside spacex in any capacity it is my hope that we could develop a mutually cohesive research relationship and identify the key areas for the expansion of thought yours sincerely alex titus
spacex,removed,i seriously need to do something about my dyslexia i totally just read the title as spotted a dragon testicle in hawthorne then i saw the thumbnail and you know it sort of looks like one might look ¯ツ¯
spacex,removed,oh okay please alert the gao nasa then to this information im sure theyll take your word for it
spacex,removed,congressional investigators so a political thing
spacex,removed,saw the title and at first glance i thought test article said testicle
spacex,removed,the byline of this article andy pasztor i think that should tell you everything you need to know about this article a shill piece for ula and something which blows out of proportion anything about spacex in the most negative of light he has almost no credibility in my book as a journalist if that term has any meaning at all and skates very close to the line in term of libel where it surprises me that spacex hasnt filed a lawsuit against the creep if this has any sort or reason for being a real issue i would expect almost anybody else to report about it even at the wall street journal much less any other immensely more credible source of information about the company
spacex,removed,how about we find another source of information that can confirm what this shill has said first the guy is legendary in his hate of spacex and his lack of ability to report objectively
spacex,removed,elon musks twitter account speeches given by musk and shotwell over the past year and numerous technical briefings all can be significant sources of information in addition nasa i think you could come up with numerous other much more credible sources than this shill piece
spacex,removed,now a real trick would be landing the spacecraft on the booster
spacex,removed,op source requires i sign up for spam
spacex,removed,alright
spacex,removed,kerbal space program would have a lot to say about this but it was only an explosion mission control didnt even blow up

spacex,removed,its just my ocd sneaking out
spacex,removed,you are probably aware of this but texas is huge saying boca chica has proximity to infrastructure in waco is like saying raleigh nc is proximate to new york city its a seven hours drive
spacex,removed,now be honest how much time did it take to turn that fax from hawthorne into a neatly formatted comment the only part i disagree on as far as you can disagree with predictions is the people i feel like mct will be built to support a but will take way less in practice kind of like how the crew dragon can support without cargo but will probably fly with some seats removed to me it seems it makes more sense to initially fly with a lot of goods rovers and heavy machinery to prepare a basecamp before moving in more meat
spacex,removed,no abort system is present can you expand on this as well as your prediction for the mct return trip to earth do you think that the mct will return to leo only and simply not be capable of a propulsive landing on earth because otherwise it would seem crazy not to design an abort procedure as a worst case safety net
spacex,removed,ssto mode
spacex,removed,so i havent readheard but youre predicting stages the saturn v rocket had stages and from everything weve heard the bfr will be bigger than that so im curious do we know how many stages the bfr will have

spacex,removed,seconds at sea level extremely optimistic there echo
spacex,removed,well hmm well then shit yeah
spacex,removed,i like your list but why build it in georgia just seems out of the blue to me
spacex,removed,i dont think you truly understand the cave on mars idea the cave is just a simple way to create a very large open enclosed space without building a giant dome you just need to build an air lock at the entrance where humans broke into the cave and then fill the cave with standard earth air mix then you have a very large area where people can live without suits you could grow food with grow lamps inside or have the greenhouse outside the cave and if you find some underground source of water it could become a pretty nice place to live set up their oen daynight schedule and be protected from radiation once manufacturing is built up they can move into large surface enclosers and cities but a huge marian cave may be a good transition point from a collection of hab modules to a full city sized domes remember these lava tube caves on mars can be anywhere from to km wide and long thats a lot of living space
spacex,removed,no use of underground caves who wants to live in an underground cave youre trying to build a city here i agree but not for the reasons you are stating i want to live in a cave lava tubes could be awesome locations for cities but i dont think it will be the first target why because it adds an unknown to the construction effort we wont know at first how big the cave is or any possible structural issues or how easily it could be pressurized or any number of other variables a pressurized cave would also be a single large open pressure area and that means singlepointoffailure im sure theyll make those eventually its one of the appeals of cave living but not at first i could see caves being used for a later outpost after it has been properly surveyed and cave building techniques have been tested

spacex,removed,manufacturing of bfrbfs close to the launch site max km away i would counter that the factory will not be located in a remote crappy place thousands of space engineering professional wont be thrilled about being forced to live in south texas or vieques if the launch site is boca chica i predict the factory will be in the houston area with completed sections sent south by barge an alternate site might be in georgia who were in the running when boca chica was selected both construction and launching could happen at the same location for that one

spacex,removed,oh dear sounds like you do not like mr musk very much or the government or spaceflight

spacex,removed,considering what it must be like when all the engines are firing it reminds me of that flogging molly song
spacex,removed,the space industry is great for florida the us and the world so by helping the leading company spacex florida is supporting the industry however is a bit borderline it goes against the point of new space which is to create a real market not one driven by politics but being a huge fan of spacex still think its for the best
spacex,removed,whats wrong with buffering the video while the link is out and picking up from where it left off when the link is reestablished

spacex,removed,the floating taco is obviously his best work to date

spacex,removed,next steps launch of used booster until we get bored launch of a crew dragon fh uwgb launch of a red dragon uwgb launch of a bfr mct until we are dead
spacex,removed,it becomes so boring its amazing
spacex,removed,i was expecting a graph of where or not they are crashing lol
spacex,removed,they should consider adding a flaming hoop
spacex,removed,nominal i believe you mean
spacex,removed,or this
spacex,removed,to be fair this time they didnt have a people venue lined up with the owner
spacex,removed,inappropriate title should be zodiac killer visited spacex mcgregor today
spacex,removed,it has a higher thrust to weight ratio meaning it can lift payloads much too heavy for the falcon the main reason is that its a much bigger rocket
spacex,removed,theres not even any cool crashes anymore
spacex,removed,upvoted
spacex,removed,but its technically landings of the same rocket right so the points should be cumulative bwa ha ha
spacex,removed,this makes me wonder how long until synchronized rocket acrobatics becomes an olympic sport p
spacex,removed,success
spacex,removed,but now they are crashing lol
spacex,removed,i just want better footage
spacex,removed,cute the entire plot to deep space homer
spacex,removed,its reddit i figured they were reposts why would i upvote a repost
spacex,removed,i was less excited about the time i got laid than the
spacex,removed,that looks like something out of mass effect
spacex,removed,i only watched for the explosions now they got the whole landing thing down its just the same old stuff
spacex,removed,wow flight mustve had like at least points
spacex,removed,until one blows up
spacex,removed,how about the surface of the sun check mate
spacex,removed,reddit points
spacex,removed,good great grand
spacex,removed,sploosh
spacex,removed,green dragon
spacex,removed,i no longer cry when i see a space rocket landing on a boat at sea as beautifully as a bird but it will never become boring to me i enjoy seeing a beautiful sunset child woman or achievement every time i see them what musk plans to do on mars will be even more thrilling and possibly the beginning of an adventure that may take us who knows where the longer i live and the more i see the better i doubt that many people realize that what they are now seeing spacex do is their ticket out of the hell that life on this planet will have become a few generations from now most of these rockets are being launched by people of european ancestry a race that will no longer exist a few generations from now as musk wisely pointed out at musk knows what our antiwhite media conglomerates fail to tell us about what happens to a country once its white population loses control a few generations from now crime rates in the civilized world will have become as high as they are in the parts of the world from which people are now immigrating to european homelands the population of european homelands will eventually resemble the one at so much that those who are searching for a better life will be waiting in line to buy tickets to mars
spacex,removed,rredditthroughhistory
spacex,removed,remember where we parked
spacex,removed,the people got nasa when they wanted nascar without the crashes its just some dudes driving orbiting in circles
spacex,removed,use this one simple trick to get live streaming footage of any stage rocket landing

spacex,removed,evolution produces species like tyrannosaurus rex not domesticated animals domesticated dogs have had some of their dangerous survival instincts bred out them so they do not behave like the undomesticated members of their own species almost every undomesticated species and race is instinctively both territorial and invasive they are as violent and they need to be in order to feed and to procreate themselves ie they steal rape slaughter and do whatever else they must in order to obtain their next meal etc because that is the only way they can compete and survive mankind would never have evolved otherwise so why be so judgmental one of elons points is that the birth rate of the relatively civilized ie domesticated populations of europe and china is lower than that of immigrants from natural resource rich places like liberia where one is about as safe as one would be in the territory of a pack of wolves or lions if diversity is so great why not transport human savages to mars too if you watch a few episodes of the justice network at httpwwwjusticenetworktvcomshowtitles eg bait car you will see that people who behave like liberians inhabit the americas too why be so judgmental

spacex,removed,so many survival instincts have to be bred out of domesticated plants people and other animals in order to make them more beneficial to the societies in which they live that they can not survive unless they are segregated from their undomesticated cousins elon explained other reasons why our racecivilization is not likely to last much longer at domesticating the plants people and other animals that made the kebaron httpenwikipediaorgwikikebaranculture and natufian httpenwikipediaorgwikinatufian cultures possible took the neolithic ancestors of northern europeans thousands of years they were able to do so because they lived for over ten thousand years on farms in permanent homes in a geographically isolated and therefore safer part of the world where game was too scarce for hunter gatherers to survive they fled into europe because semitic herdsmen from the southwestern arabian peninsula began to invade and to conquer the fertile crescent about years ago balaresque et al state the relative contributions to modern european populations of paleolithic huntergatherers and neolithic farmers from the near east have been intensely debated haplogroup is the commonest european ychromosomal lineage increasing in frequency from east to west and carried by million european men the distribution of this lineage the diversity within it and estimates of its age all suggest that it spread with farming from the near east taken with evidence on the origins of other lineages this indicates that most european y chromosomes descend from near eastern farmers previous studies suggested a paleolithic origin but here we show that the geographical distribution of its microsatellite diversity is best explained by spread from a single source in the near east via anatolia during the neolithic in contrast most maternal lineages descend from huntergatherers ie most europeans have crômagnon mitochondrial dna

spacex,removed,spacex on instagram view of landing zone this morning at cape canaveral about minutes after launch of dragon to the space station oh shit did i the firststage of falcon will attempt to land on oh good
spacex,removed,it may render quicker i am basing this off of nothing other than pure speculation that makes me a bit of an expert on this topic
spacex,removed,same way i let my wife know relations are going down tonight

spacex,removed,maybe in if humanity survives next years
spacex,removed,woot woot go waterloop
spacex,removed,if this is a pad issue which it seems why cant spacex plow right ahead with a string of launches from vandenberg in the meantime
spacex,removed,damm hes really serious about this tunnel venture isnt he lmao

spacex,removed,mods seem to angry with this thread i caught this right before it disappeared dont disagree with the mods here or they will ban you and tell you its conspiracy nonsense i thought op was wrong but still presented a good case and thought some sources aside from employees would be nice after being banned for requesting sources other than employees and being accused of conspiracy nonsense i think op is actually on to something
spacex,removed,this must be the guy the mods decided to ban seems a little ridiculous to me dont disagree with the mods here or they will ban you and tell you its conspiracy nonsense i thought op was wrong but still presented a good case and thought some sources aside from employees would be nice after being banned for requesting sources other than employees and being accused of conspiracy nonsense i think op is actually on to something
spacex,removed,but dont you just love the thought of musk and shotwell sitting in mission control with a couple of joysticks

spacex,removed,aka we ran out of gas
spacex,removed,happens to me all the time in ksp

spacex,removed,yeah i know people that cant even drive across the state without running out of gas
spacex,removed,its ok falcon is a big strong rocket puny traffic light is no match for it
spacex,removed,oh come on its the facebook group what do you expect from them reading comprehension
spacex,removed,infantile nonsense
spacex,removed,lol its an iphone photo of a wrapped rocket posted to a public site its not like they put hours into creating intellectual property
spacex,removed,happy cakeday
spacex,removed,god who the hell made these whoosh sounds at theyre horrible
spacex,removed,focus you fuck
spacex,removed,standing there laughing maniacally because well thats the way my brain decided to react at the sight of a rocket going the wrong way
spacex,removed,and i and me
spacex,removed,precisely and i say that with absolutely no fear of reddits obviously cultish and overly protective love for anything even remotely related to spacex down vote me harder than landing attempt for all i care
spacex,removed,someone needs to make a meme with elon musk and u mad bro seems especially apropos for this
spacex,removed,geez
spacex,removed,haha damnit i just realized how bad that mistake was
spacex,removed,more like with a truckload of salt eh
spacex,removed,my thoughts exactly
spacex,removed,when you see that buzzfeed is the source and refuse to click on the link
spacex,removed,its buzzfeed
spacex,removed,new heights relative to the companies previous spend amounts without sources spacex spent wow mods recommend removal of this story
spacex,removed,this all sounds great until you realize it relies on a magical nuclear reactor that doesnt exist yet
spacex,removed,its so sad that this is a cost of doing business nationally
spacex,removed,buzzfeeds stories can be how shall i say it questionable the story on trumps supposed connection to russia by the former british spy intelligence officer lol was an excellent example of poor journalistic ethics nevertheless even spacex has a pac that contributes to candidates nowhere near contributed to legislators by the pac but not insignificant either house total to democrats total to republicans senate total to democrats total to republicans pretty even distribution by party
spacex,removed,forget what the administration says they are untrustworthy ill go write an article right now for them called reasons buzfeed is untrustworthy
spacex,removed,they try to put out normal stories to try to make it seem like of their articles arent garbage written by random people even their normal articles are often unconfirmed reports that other reputable news agencies dont publish i dont think the mods should allow buzzfeed articles here if its true and accurate other outlets will publish something similar
spacex,removed,its part of playing the game at top level are we really surprised by this
spacex,removed,just the usual legal corruption move along folks nothing to see here
spacex,removed,buzzfeed is sjw mecca no normal person would take that site serious
spacex,removed,i think reebok shoes are completely new for spacesuits
spacex,removed,wake me up when its a catastrophe
spacex,removed,because of that it does not matter how much more expensive arianespace is than spacex rocket lab or blue origin etc except the eu probably wont exist in ten years
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,if were months from fh that must mean were months from a rud bites nails
spacex,removed,calm down everyone dont get nervous fh is still months away and it will ever be we will fix the situation soon so it is months away again
spacex,removed,why cant they just do it now
spacex,removed,remember this is the second flight of fh the test flight must go before that
spacex,removed,so basically the wealthy have more votes
spacex,removed,for fucks sake clickbait is buzzfeeds business period the to fund investigative journalism is just the pr bullshit in other news some company is dumping toxic sewage into a river but wait they say that the money saved by doing this goes to fund environmental causes
spacex,removed,correction course corrections are hard
spacex,removed,any news yet on crewed missions i know the unmanned crew demo mission was planned for have there been any updates on that
spacex,removed,and consistent failures
spacex,removed,i dread to think
spacex,removed,is there a formal definition of the elon factor
spacex,removed,is there any way to watch this launch online
spacex,removed,i am imagining a flight delay while an engineer has to climb the stack and plug a usb drive into the side of the stage some where
spacex,removed,you have to distract it at just the right moment perhaps by jumping out or making a startling declaration or some such then you will miss the ground entirely and as a result flight
spacex,removed,i always liked the idea of the naming one so much for subtlety because it fits spacexs style quite well

spacex,removed,not daunted by communicating technical concepts to a nontechnical background but a passion for technology
spacex,removed,silly commenter we dont need to launch nukes at it we have a bruce willis problem solved and bruce could be ready for launch in a day or two surely
spacex,removed,no see youre overthinking this weve already we know how to deal with that situation except we used the shuttle last time so thats kind of a problem now i suppose

spacex,removed,go read the literature go read the literature go read the literature what are you years old ive been reading the literature since the so youre not gonna pull that wool over my eyes ive got about books about the subject on a shelf across the room here you just cant admit youre wrong because youve invested so much of your life into being a hick and admitting it would hurt you too much better to drag everyone else down to your level right
spacex,removed,i was too busy being a smart arse to think hard about your point but i agree you nailed what elon meant im thinking the height of each rocket was taken as representing the mass of the rocket in the same way as a simple vertical bar would because the relative heights of the rockets were maintained the height of the mass to leo bar behind each rocket was scaled to accurately give the relationship for that rocket so i think tony chu is probably wrong saturn could lift half its dry weight to leo
spacex,removed,great hes not a cylon hes from rama

spacex,removed,so in the future mankind creates a computer that is so smart it is considered god and that computer starts doing science for humans to ya know help them to find answers to things theyhumans need to know and it starts to experiment with sending information backwards in time to see if it can accelerate the advancement of humanity ya know kinda like if you could send multivitamins back in time into your grandads tap water would you could help you family long term who knows right who knows the point is now that argument from authority is out of the way the real question you are asking is who will pay for it
spacex,removed,so far theyve tested it times im determined to keep watching until it stops relighting

spacex,removed,this post is higher quality than some posts i see here everyday and far better than that qa session elon who makes references about underpant stealing from south park and names his ships in homage to scifi literature by iain banks and douglas adams would get an homage to robert heinlein when he saw one this is a riff on space family robinson if i am not mistaken
spacex,removed,marsgold ha yes exactly its not a spacex disrespect its commentary on what the its is likely to enable its very similar to the oregon trail and theres a lot of scifi that focuses on asteroid mining with or without martian flat cats
spacex,removed,it look like at this point they have narrowed it down to a few possibilities and are squeezing the data to try to find out which one but squeezing the data only get you so far when you have only of failure event to analyze the wort thing is that one of the remaining best hypothesis is a resonance of the helium tank itself due to the refueling around it and i would be surprised if accelerometers are present close enough the said tank to be able to check this hypothesis a large structure act like a low pass filter and theses vibration are obviously not too visible in the data prior to the event of course one other low probability hypothesis and funnier since its a conspiracy theory is that some guy with a snipper hid within of the exclusion zone and shot the general direction of the rocket results are guaranteed and probabilities of finding evidence is extremely low it is just a large breach now why someone would be hired to do that well a lot of people are losing lots of money and its just some corporate sabotage with no physical harm involved after all
spacex,removed,oh thats nice we the taxpayers supply nasa with funding
spacex,removed,well what if i want to crash a bus into europa

spacex,removed,his rocket has the highest payload capacity of any rocket ever even with full reusability do you really believe that seriously
spacex,removed,found on youtube spacex qa session in a nutshell
spacex,removed,if it actually were about community but facebook is only about showing everyone how great you are and about content theft
spacex,removed,i agree but that was also the rationale for building the shuttle at any rate the its booster as specified will have a pitiful payloadfraction or be an expendable

spacex,removed,nasa have diverse interests from various regional offices spacex however have one interest to colonise mars and one primary site in hawthorne california where everything gets built and all strategic decisions are made this focus allows spacex to achieve mars milestones right now rather than nasas years nasa astronauts will get to mars a lot sooner with spacex help and theyll have no problem finding life because therell be a whole bunch of spacex engineers to greet them

spacex,removed,marsdone
spacex,removed,no i agree we need actual scientists there and as many possible i just think andy weier instead of one of them isnt that big of a deal the people making the decisions are the bottleneck at this point you can throw buckets of scientists at them and only possibly get a marginally better result you think theres a shortage of scientists making the case for climate change or making the urgency clear andy weier is not the bottleneck but again i dont disagree with you i just dont think andy weier will have any negative impact and will get though whatever any actual engineer would as far as the morons in congress are concerned

spacex,removed,err what a winging libtard he comes across like
spacex,removed,clearly not cut out for spacex
spacex,removed,lol yeah right tuesdays election is a huge victory for the usa trump for president in also
spacex,removed,good for the rest of america take that globalist agenda to another country
spacex,removed,its his choice to leave for any reason he chooses but spacexs goals and path to success will continue through a trump presidency elon himself was rather indifferent to clinton and trump being us president is like being captain of a large ship with a small rudder – theres a limit to how much damage they can do
spacex,removed,trump supporter aye lol
spacex,removed,i disagree with your opinions i presume you mean this opinion here in the united states my home for the last eight years tuesdays election result is yet another huge setback because this part this has been an election marked by repeated attacks on immigrants minorities women and many other communities is undeniable
spacex,removed,so another career broken by twitter with him
spacex,removed,i do not share his views of the world and the election but its totally his call sad to see a good guy leave the one place that could really bring lasting change to how we view the world but in grand scheme of things the pr guy is probably replaceable
spacex,removed,everyone is much better off with him gone anyone who lacks the critical thinking skills to recognize that the driving force behind these decades of violence in the middle east is people like hrc is a net efficiency loss to any organization
spacex,removed,aw boohoo this post should be removed imo this is no place for politics and this post is nothing but politics
spacex,removed,sad to see him go but happy theres one more smart person joining the fight against the new fascism
spacex,removed,ironically trump is already winding back some of his more extreme antisocial promises as he faces the prospect of having to actually carry them out the area where he appears to be blithely going full steam ahead is the one which can eventually cause the greatest harm to society he is determined to withdraw all american support from the efforts to control climate change that is an area where a great deal of effort needs to be expended to counteract the trump effect
spacex,removed,insert the usual identity politics
spacex,removed,it probably has something to do with this while its fine for people to express their political beliefs if youre the press spokesman for a major corporation its probably a big nono
spacex,removed,with all due personal respect to the individual in question i seriously hope he fails in forcing these social changes on western countries it is a clear and unapologetic attempt to destroy western cultures and peoples
spacex,removed,do we really need to get into political controversy here yes his leaving spacex is a spacex news item but the reason he is leaving is not and imo violates the rules of this subreddit please lets talk about what spacex is doing not divisive political items
spacex,removed,was the personal attack really necessary sorry you feel that way cant nerf everything for everyone
spacex,removed,i dont disagree with your argument but i think its important to consider that the negative impacts of climate change will likely manifest long before we have a significant multiplanetary presence so itd be extremely dangerous to not think of climate change as a current priority
spacex,removed,definitely matt desch is the king of hype
spacex,removed,but mark watney just played around with some hydrazine without a space suit he even exploded and was just fine i call shenanigans
spacex,removed,id like to believe they tested the suit with an animal in it someone has to be the scape goat
spacex,removed,hurry up guys we have a bunch more ready to go after these
spacex,removed,i have been a brewer for too long the thumbnail of the fairing looked like an iridium next beer can now i wonder what kind of beer it would have been

spacex,removed,overflight quote from alexander zuyev pilot who defected with his airplane the last pvo regiment at gudauta was transferred to anadir in the artic in only three days after an american overflew soviet far eastso overflights did happen soviets developed and coordinated them in numbers to intercept from multiple angles had they not overflown soviet territory the soviets would not have developed the the mig was determined to be too slow at lower altitudes to make the intercepts the overflew the soviet union for years
spacex,removed,if you have watched a tour of the iss you realize that during the day trip to mars people will have to share those notsoconvenient space toilets there is not really any way to shower and when you brush your teeth you have to either swallow the paste or carefully spit it into a paper towel after you finish in addition if people need to jerk off in the spacecraft the fluids dont simply go down the drain so the real question is who will be our designated janitor
spacex,removed,sounds like a really fucking cool hobby man
spacex,removed,uhh nice
spacex,removed,youre under because if youre older then technically you could claim prior art and invalidate that ludicrous patent
spacex,removed,i wish you all the luck in the world selling that design
spacex,removed,i told monarch this was a bad idea
spacex,removed,shity launch system
spacex,removed,my vote is on big orbital object necessitating diverse organizational gluttony generating lavish excesses or boondoggle for short
spacex,removed,yeah palin he cant be more irresponsible than to pick her
spacex,removed,yes lying to congress so clever
spacex,removed,sorry to bust this myth he didnt selffund his campaign in the general his campaign was majorly backed by the usual republican donors like adelson and the mercer family the latter is the one who actually repaired his campaign by taking over management and they brought in bannon and conway plus it looks like he wil bring out the establishment republicans for the actual policy work pence gingrich cristie etc to keep it spacex related maybe ginrich gets to build his moonbase now
spacex,removed,ok
spacex,removed,yes make ksp come to life
spacex,removed,hes actually planning on increasing their budget
spacex,removed,they just need to name the craft the america so that trump cantwont get rid of itright that show this works right
spacex,removed,these are people who dont know what hard work is that logic is beyond them
spacex,removed,or has seat belts
spacex,removed,did he literally go out of his way to find the most hated people in the nation and put them in power
spacex,removed,his name sure is cool mad dash
spacex,removed,im picking when he receives briefing hell do a uturn on planetary science i bet obama started softening him up in that minute talk they had my fantasy is that with the fervor of a convert hell carry the trumpkins along with then trump wont just make america great hell save the planet
spacex,removed,would be a problem trump decides to claim mars for america
spacex,removed,its more likely that trump wants to put boobs on mars open a strip club there
spacex,removed,trump wants there to be competition competition drives innovation
spacex,removed,if he was predictable you would have a point hes not how much of his campaign was real and how much was bullshit intended to get votes we dont know and cant meaningfully guess starting a business in the next year on the basis of what you think his policies will be would be irresponsible
spacex,removed,i dare you to show me somebody from snl or frankly even liberal commentators who said you know this is a good idea but it is stupid to see gingrich be the one to propose this concept easy dare to make i know people said that but im not going to look it up so you can continue with your delusions
spacex,removed,i think the idea is to leave the portion of the global population that think like trump behind
spacex,removed,what does that have to do with big oil are you talking about climate studies and people getting in a political contest about what to do about results from those studies you are making a mistake about those who might not want to drink the koolaide of climate change nonsense with a lack of concern about the environment about the very real issues of peak oil production and a desire to not simply destroy the planet for the sake of a few bucks there is common ground that can be had along with some common sense to environmental issues that isnt going to simply end legitimate and objective science happening that monitors the earth for both short term and long term forecasts this is not an excuse for why earth science studies are going to end
spacex,removed,because you think trump would claim a single part when he can claim the whole planet
spacex,removed,i think they will need a bigger yacht
spacex,removed,and i think hes too much of an egomaniac to wait
spacex,removed,might have popped up why do you have to use that word

spacex,removed,sure i mean
spacex,removed,i was wondering about the black residue on the first stage is that from the heat of reentry and similar to the burn marks on a capsule on reentry or is it from flying through its own exhaust plume

spacex,removed,they do they like to poke elon with a stick like welcome to the club when spacex landed a booster that put a payload in orbit i kinda wanted to punch bezos on that one
spacex,removed,team bunny
spacex,removed,its cause it was caused by an alien
spacex,removed,even fh is larger thrust wise on than new glenn ng so were calling this thing the bo ng
spacex,removed,in competition pointing out the opponents flaws isnt insulting who cares about their feelings they either get results of they dont and yes that rocket is a toy it barely met the minimum altitude to be considered space and hasnt launched a payload get results of get the fuck out of the way so money can be used towards actually flyable hardware
spacex,removed,new shepard with the capsule is the most big thing looking big thing ever
spacex,removed,no no no no and again no the single cores cannot be modified to be used as boosters for fh for fucks sake how many times does this need to be repeated read the goddamn faq
spacex,removed,of the time it lands everytime
spacex,removed,that sounds like some new axe body spray
spacex,removed,how about new watney
spacex,removed,named after neil armstrong first man on the moon guess what this rocket will do return from eve
spacex,removed,i did not have navierstokes relations with that woman
spacex,removed,anyone but watney

spacex,removed,if i wanted to view a falcon launch where would i do that obviously down at cape canaveral but where would i permitted to actually view the launch from any good spots any of you recommend what if there is also a landing on land thank you
spacex,removed,i am not certain on exactly what he is doing however i believe he is testing flight software which may include orbital maneuvers and aerobreaking orientation on mars entry on the dragon capsule

spacex,removed,i was just gonna pass over this but this comment drove me to downvote
spacex,removed,did anybody take into account the industrial sabotage option
spacex,removed,he has a lots of karma its the same person as the article

spacex,removed,the moderators of this sub exhibit some pretty extreme elitism and bias i am currently awaiting an official response and will publicly disclose their response or lack thereof and my removed post this evening this is disgusting and the elitism present on this sub is toxic to anyone not favoring spacex not favored or well known to the moderators and is an embarrassment to the spaceflight enthusiast community teach dont ridicule or silence we do not care if it is a burden you chose to open this sub you choose to remain in a position of power on this sub deal with it
spacex,removed,hi seattle design office this is elon can you add an interplanetary laser relay to the satellites not all of them just some of them interplanetary okay may as well make it all of them thats a big addition great thanks
spacex,removed,youre all such nerds thats a comiment
spacex,removed,in this post comment will update with media shared in comments downvote if unwanted selfdeletes if score is less than rchrisolivertimes rradditplaylists
spacex,removed,so basically we got that new rocket which is pretty cool and will get us to mars this is what it looks like it will have and err the crew is gonna be transported like that and will get its energy from solar power these panels are of course reusable after the autopiloted reentry so yeah thats also pretty cool
spacex,removed,terraforming mars will be way easier than stopping climate change on earth lol

spacex,removed,if only nasa had one less a in its acronym it would be awash in cash
spacex,removed,can i come seriously
spacex,removed,that would be so awesome if the hatch opens and a helicopter flys out
spacex,removed,space mike youre the best
spacex,removed,feelings and i just remembered we lost rip
spacex,removed,i find it ironic that something titled epicfuturespace would be writing about old rocket testing systems that have no current nor future use not very epic
spacex,removed,man hope they gave you a job after this snow job on how things are going at spacex
spacex,removed,and if you dont agree with me lets just hit play again at the qa during the its presentation on youtube lets cry while watching what spacex and elon let happen its on them and elon to tweet about sabotage being a multimillionaire owner of gigantic corporations with a childish behavior signaling stock market like that its horrible really
spacex,removed,they have found at least two ways to replicate the failure the loading process and shooting the tank with a rifle just because you can replicate the effect doesnt mean you found the cause
spacex,removed,my reaction also oh shit wait what
spacex,removed,i was particularly interested in the flying space bacon
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,they are a private company that deliver satellites for many companies if elon behaves like a child talks about sabotage for milhions of people to see after sending his team visited personaly a close base that belongs to a private compnay yeah you make a lot of sense he is right in doing that i must be the child s
spacex,removed,i guess i cant use the word faggot on spacex
spacex,removed,but failure mode was similar enough to say that some copv anomaly caused the failure recall that musk said that by firing a rifle at the stage they could exactly replicate what happened his words that doesnt mean a rifle caused the failure similarly these tests dont mean theyve nailed down loading procedure as a cause it only means that improper loading can cause a similar failure to what was witnessed also consider that spacexs october statement is striking the omission of whether the test loading procedures used to create a failure were the same as those used on the day of the event this strongly suggests the loading conditions used to create the testing failure were different perhaps quite different from those used on the day of the event after all had they used the same loading conditions one would imagine the root cause would be definitively nailed down spacex says it has not
spacex,removed,flair post please ignore
spacex,removed,barring a radical breakthrough callisto and other moons without atmospheres would be tough to land on
spacex,removed,bullet point a new form of propulsion that interacts with more dimensions than we live in to give rockets so much thrust that huggggeee rockets may rise slowly until out of the atmosphere then achieve light speed cause i says so
spacex,removed,the problem is that the tons goal to orbit is too much for a mts diameter core of a falcon heavy thus the use of a larger one
spacex,removed,i disagree at the recode conference he talked a bit about the size of the rocket and then said he would say much more at iac
spacex,removed,while these are some exciting propositions this is perhaps the time that ive seen someone misunderstand what vertical integration is it is simply the concept of manufacturing a product in house rather than outsourcing materialslabor it has nothing to do with the physical orientation of an object
spacex,removed,why a sea launch
spacex,removed,i like the idea of renaming bfr to saturn vi to suggest a worthy successor to the famous saturn v
spacex,removed,potatoes will be aboard the first crewed mct flight youre not irish are you
spacex,removed,they are probably limited by the date of the thread
spacex,removed,second hand reused sloppy seconds as least they didnt use that horrible term beloved of used car lots preloved bleh
spacex,removed,why not use point to point radios to the recovery ship and have that use its satellite uplink
spacex,removed,a cable threaded thru floaty tubes could work
spacex,removed,yes yes yes confirmed flight
spacex,removed,someone should give out points for accuracy of landing execution of the flip etc
spacex,removed,plus just think of the competition spacex is
spacex,removed,i kind of want the onion headline for this used rocket salesman elon musk successfully closes first sale
spacex,removed,my opinion is that they wanted to voice what i was intending to discuss
spacex,removed,barely fired only launched to church on sundays garage parked
spacex,removed,then we could reenact this scene
spacex,removed,factory refurbished
spacex,removed,second hand preowned item may show signs of wear and or scratches
spacex,removed,refurbished booster surely you meant to say a flightproven booster
spacex,removed,curiously the only thing that went through the mind of the firststage booster as it fell was oh no not again many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the booster had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of spacex than we do now
spacex,removed,well it survived a first crash
spacex,removed,wow love that solar sand printer i think if reengineered with more precision thatd be incredible
spacex,removed,the first living thing send on mars will not be a human but a potato does that imply soil because that would imply a lot of living things in fact ill bet that like us potatoes normally have a whole ecosystem of bacteria tiny insects etc going on inside them and especially on their surface even without considering the soil anyway i like the atmo prediction first time ive heard that idea have longterm effects of such a mix been monitored
spacex,removed,make it to flights it gets named the decade falcon for the century falcon you get the idea

spacex,removed,i can see the headlines now mars declares independence
spacex,removed,its or bfs is go anywhere you want transport system on mars i just figure out when i was watching mars show that you can use your ship to go anywhere on mars when you landed there if you refuel your spaceship you have of delta v that means that you can jump from your main base to any location do your stuff like science you can live on your ship and then jump back to your main base

spacex,removed,locally sourced artisanal martian propellant
spacex,removed,i work in a factory here on earth gave ma a good chuckle
spacex,removed,days are passing and it looks to me sometimes as a conspiracy theory they need more time beacause were under pressure almost all time in hurry since a reused booster would be used at the end of the year a falcon heavy would fly at the begining of the next year also a crew dragon spacecraft should be flying having the pressure of public opinion when will they do all these why they are pushing back dates for these missions everything is going ok why they arent testing them before the explosion so what they do they exploded their own rocket have a lot more time for themself in this way to be sure that their upcoming first tests of their vehicles will be success why should do these because every kind of failure in the first test of a reused booster falcon heavy or crewed dragon spacecraft would give them a stronger punch for their bussines and then imagine what would say public oppinion for their program in this way they will have at least months time if it is about the money musk has billions doesnt care and besides the other upcoming missions for private market arent cancelled those are just pushed back they will get again their money difference it is they just will take them some months later but they will continue getting money this is better then losing chances for bigger contracts if something goes bad with reused booster falcon heavy or the crewed dragon spacecraft an important contract with nasa for iss why being all time in hurry to respect the schedule dates rising the chances that the project wont be ok since their are running in hurry in their work so something could go wrong and not being done correct and right why blow up all new projects which gives much more proffits and are very important lets blow one rocket which isnt a fatal failure since they will present it to public as not something very important didnt blow because of the desing it happened because they didnt pay to much attention to a simple part of the rocket wich was the cause
spacex,removed,blue and red pill
spacex,removed,to mars
spacex,removed,hmmmm idk how much do we really know about this foxhound guy i dont trust him
spacex,removed,thanks for this i love how he is thinking about the government structure it seems far away but starting things off with a good direction is so important
spacex,removed,mcgregors had to test some interesting stuff before but nothing quite like this props to all the employees who worked long nights on the investigation or playing catchup
spacex,removed,the rough transcript is from a recording of the event is that recording public or can you share it
spacex,removed,yes but this part cannot be stressed enough we dont think that is likely this time around but we are definitely going to have to take precautions against that in the future we looked at who would want to blow up a spacex rocket that turned out to be a long list i think it is unlikely this time but it is something we need to recognize as a real possibility in the future it is just elon being careful and insuring that every aspect of a launch is covered arianespace ula and russians use military to secure their launches this is no different
spacex,removed,the improbable nature of such a thing happening without more evidence to support it is what keeps it in the realm of conspiracy theorists they have to do their due diligence so they checked if its possible but everything theyve said publicly so far indicates they dont believe this is actually what happened
spacex,removed,so are we back to this being a rocket problem maybe not a design problem but just a manufacturing defect that went uncaught i am really curious as to why if the copv had oxygen trapped in its carbon layers that issue didnt happen when yhe second stage had its hot fire test at the test stand in texas
spacex,removed,did they actually shoot a rocket on a test stand
spacex,removed,direct democracy is a great idea considering the size of the initial colony it would be difficult to change away from that afterwards though i think not that this is a bad think direct democracy is kind of representative as well its just the representatives are everyone i wonder what the youngest person permitted to travel will be and whether they will have a say
spacex,removed,i wonder what the most effective protection from this would be perhaps an opaque physical screen of some sort through which any projectile would have to travel and dense enough to prevent such from closing the remaining distance only works on the pad though
spacex,removed,for people who arent understanding the solid oxygen comment heres a likely scenario where this occurs the helium copvs are sitting inside the oxygen tank the oxygen tank is then filled with subcooled oxygen thats very close to oxygens freezing temperature the helium tanks are then begun to be filled when you fill a the tanks initially before too much pressure builds up the helium will be expanding from the pressure lines into the pressure vessels this will cause an associated temperature drop this could cause the surface of the vessel to drop below the freezing temperature of oxygen there will now be tiny oxygen crystals that develop in between the aluminum tank and the carbon fiber wrapping of the copv as the vessel is then pressurized these crystals are strongly compressed as the copv expands by a few centimeters as it pressurizes when you strongly compress an oxidizer and a fuel source you can cause spontaneous combustion if the pressures are high enough this causes tank and copv rupture and then the runaway explosion of the vehicle
spacex,removed,printing works fine for superdracos but too much work is needed to make it feasible on raptors im guessing he was talking about a very specific part of the system architecture otherwise this is quite a significant announcement
spacex,removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commentcommercial crew program capsule communicator ground support used in this commenthttpsenwikipediaorgwikicompositeoverwrappedpressurevessel used in this commentkennedy space center florida used in this commentliquid oxygen used in this commentunited launch alliance lockheedboeing joint venture decronym is a community product of rspacex implemented im a bot and i first saw this thread at oct utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
spacex,removed,in the future can they just film the entire surface of the rocket with high speed cameras to see whether or not a bullet is shot at it
spacex,removed,i think hes doing it on purpose at this point
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,planned launch timeline has slipped again rtf in early december now
spacex,removed,my question is how did the test the shooting theory did they send someone over to the local mcgregor academy for a and a couple of boxes of ammo to shoot at a copv
spacex,removed,how difficult would it be to shoot the rocket on the pad like that ie getting in range hitting the right part etc it also seems unlikely because the shooter would have needed to get extremely lucky to hit exactly where it was being fueled in the upper stage probably not coincidence that the explosion occurred from that point exactly
spacex,removed,i want this to be true
spacex,removed,youre the source for this right i seem to remember you work at spacex
spacex,removed,not sure if sarcasm
spacex,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
spacex,removed,lies you wouldnt be talking about it on the internet if that actually happened
spacex,removed,this were exactly my thoughts
spacex,removed,was it being fueledpressurized at the time or was it empty
spacex,removed,wow sounds like you took a page straight out of the mythbusters playbook thats impressive did you at least get the data you were looking for
spacex,removed,i can confirm what spiiice says is true heshe is a legitimate employee so should be trusted regardless though ive known through a connection in the grapevine about this for a bit but obviously this is not the kind of information to be leaked online the craziest thing i was told is that not only could they replicate the failure they could do it with a near miss that didnt even hit the tank
spacex,removed,was the mock fueled aka is there a giant patch of scorched earth in texas now
spacex,removed,we have test fired one of the returned cores times and it looks good that is promising for testing reflight during these the octaweb is fixed so thats the only part that takes the load apart from the engines and the rocket structuretanks get only the vibrations and weight low temperature of the propellant i guess so considering the first stage gets significant plus loads and gs during flight especially max q couldnt that be an issue they cannot test that on the ground so far had problems with their tanks well second stage but the principle is the same
spacex,removed,not in the test stand right
spacex,removed,i dont understand why this idea is being treated with so much derision its not an especially compelling explanation and i understand the reaction to overlyexcited conspiracy theorists but the idea is certainly within the realm of reason if were thinking about this in a bayesian way which im not sure we should then what is really the prior probability what makes this such an improbable explanation conversely this is a rocket thats flown before and that particular stage has been fired before so the probability for other explanations appears low as well so long as were comparing unlikely events it seems ludicrous to single one out as particularly objectionable people seem to be reacting more to the implication than the likelihood of the event there are certainly parties that are motivated to do this as elon confirms and its always seemed reasonable that a pressurized stage would be vulnerable to a bullet also now confirmed probably the biggest unknown is how feasible it would be to take a shot without detection but this is far from a nonstarter were not talking about crazy magic bullets
spacex,removed,that quote is terrific
spacex,removed,it would still be a conspiracy just not a conspiracy theory
spacex,removed,crazy people are a lot faster to the mic than scientists someone with an idea about an electric bus just turned into an enemy judging from his long list he may not need more enemies right now cant believe im talking sabotage
spacex,removed,sometimes conspiracies are real but its still a conspiracy theory the problem is that its easy for people to invent conspiracy theories to blame anything they want on anyone they dont like a conspiracy theory without evidence to back it up is worthless
spacex,removed,it bothers me that you conflate conspiracy with impossible conspiracies happen all the time
spacex,removed,very interesting thread figured it deserved its own submission for those who will miss it
spacex,removed,im going to reiterate you need to sell that footage to mythbusters or put it on youtube please i know it will fuel conspiracy theories but i have to imagine someone will pay for that footage for the sheer joy of the booms
spacex,removed,so cool that you just said this you must have a pretty cool job to be involved with this keep up the good work
spacex,removed,that sounds like a fascinating story
spacex,removed,he seems to be a lot more realistic with his timelines which is great too it looked pretty unlikely that theyd fly more than twice max maybe three this year yet
spacex,removed,wow this is really interesting this needs more exposure you should make this ita own post few are going to find this buried in this thread
spacex,removed,aaaaand hes gone again what happened
spacex,removed,now that sounds like a mythbusters episode
spacex,removed,has a rocket launch ever been compromised due to foul play
spacex,removed,would shooting a rocket fuel tank make it explode
spacex,removed,thats quite cool
spacex,removed,why was the thread about elons talk at the nro locked
spacex,removed,i think i know what this is about and it seems ethically questionable at best once information is out censoring it on behalf of a third party isiffy at the very least you should give people a venue to discuss it
spacex,removed,i think it was less protesting a removal and more wanting a statement on why it was nuked maybe were not entitled to that but that was a huge thread with lots of information and discussion people arent going to just sweep this under the rug
spacex,removed,can i make a new post talking about the probable cause
spacex,removed,for legal or mod decisions
spacex,removed,we cannot comment on the removal then why delete any discussion of the removal its likely a great majority of the rspacex community would embrace an open discussion of the ethicas of the removal whether or not the mods are prepared to discuss the rationale the censorship of any discussion is not only ineffective it is damaging to the community and the reputations of the moderators
spacex,removed,translation we bend the rules when we want to and ftr the stuff in question is now being spread around through pms and im not even a regular commentator here also no mod response streisand effect at its best pm me if you want the thread were talking about
spacex,removed,users are being banned for even discussing this there are open discussions of of this information ongoing at other space sites this cat is completely out of the bag what is going on
spacex,removed,so its not an ask anything thread its a spaceflight question thread you should rename it or allow people to ask anything
spacex,removed,have the mods signed some form of nda or do you mean that you choose not to comment on the removal
spacex,removed,why is this discussion allowedrelevant here but not in the ask anything thread where its being purged
spacex,removed,do you drive from the back seat often
spacex,removed,no the main diameter of the rocket is s
spacex,removed,here is a possible but very unlikely theory for the explosion when obama visited the cape a few years ago he couldnt visit the atlas launch pad because there was concern by the secret service that someone would shoot a nearby hydrogen tank with a sniper rifle so he went to visit the spacex pad instead i think a shot at the common bulkhead of the upper stage with a sniper rifle could explain the explosion furthermore the recent attack on the ceo of swiss space systems shows that mafialike methods are also present in the aerospace industry but then again its an airforce base and getting near the rocket is difficult

spacex,removed,it looks like a giant
spacex,removed,ill be that guy and ask what about sabotage or foul play i dont think it was but at this point all possibilities are on the table
spacex,removed,just needs some duct tape
spacex,removed,do not propose conspiracy theories you mean we cant talk about how this was obviously done by the illuminati now the decent content the explosion appears to be somewhat directional if you were standing where the is with your back to the strong back the front left appears to be the initial direction of the explosion how much of that is just due to the wind we can see this explosion originated at or very near to the fuelling interface it appears to be just at the intersection of the two upper stage tanks this raises a question of whether having the fueling interface near the intersection is a good idea it may be that a small fire turned into a much larger one because it quickly damaged the integrity of both the lox and tanks on the other hand fires during fueling are extremely rare so making such fundamental design changes may be reacting too much to the wrong thing hopefully the massive amount of sensors will help them figure this out and even more hopefully they had a cameras pointed at it which were substantially higher speed than the public video weve seen where in one frame it goes from fine to a serious conflagration
spacex,removed,as pointed out by scott manley we can see this explosion originated at or very near to the fuelling interface it appears to be just at the intersection of the two upper stage tanks so thats wrong for a number of reasons the x of the lens flare does not point to the fueling interface it points to the common bulkhead the fueling interface umbilical of the second stage attaches to the engine block which is below the tank about meters below the x but in any case the lens flare does not point to the origin of the detonation it points to the geometrical center of the detonation plume and thus has no physical meaning there are two main origins of the detonation where the fuel came from and where it was ignited we dont know either and its not clear from the first frame yesterday i have analyzed the video as well and went through all the post detonation frames one by one in the fps video heres a quick list of what i found in reply to a comment by ueasterncyborg i reconstructed the origin path of individual pieces shrapnel flying in the air and they appear to have come from the same area about meter below the common bulkhead about meters below the origin of the lens flare visible in the second frame the highspeed shrapnel visible in the video looks like aluminum tank skin one of them in particular reflects back the light of the fire in one of the frames i reconstructed the various lens flares in the video i dont think they pinpoint the origin of the detonation they are simply pointing to the geometric middle of the visible detonation plume ie the lens flare origin doesnt have a true physical meaning the trajectories of the ejecta are more reliable and seem to point slightly below the lens flare center i annotated the apparent movement of the nose cone and found that its not real movement but the optical illusion created by a burning plume rising on the left side of the rocket this illuminates part of the fairing that creates the appearance of it leaning towards the strongback until the fairing is covered by the plume the aperture of the camera appears to be unchanged for the first couple of frames this can be verified from looking at the visible brightness of constant light sources such as lighting based on this the average illumination of the fire can be seen on the bottom right spherical lox tank as the fire gets reflected and shrunk that point of light is the illumination it clearly suggests a bright initial detonation followed by a fire that is ramping up later on the camera autoshrinks its aperture as the fireball expands and its heat increases interestingly the frames themselves are showing a second peak in illumination but this cannot be seen in the reflection on the big spherical lox tank this is the frame of the explosion in the video this is the only frame that is showing two lens flares it is possible that the plume of the first explosion is shadowing the second one in the direction of the big spherical lox tank but the air is still clear towards the camera so i believe there are events altogether the first detonation was very quick the second one lasted frames and the third one structural disintegration was the big fire everyone sees when watching the video the shadows in the frame are all very interesting for example in the first frame the shadow of the left side grid fin suggests that the first detonation happened over a volume that extended well beyond the rockets diameter in the direction of the camera this appears to support fuelair mixture scenarios the sharp shadow at the lower part of the rocket suggest either that the detonation also occurred within the strongarms volume and the structure possibly shadowed the flash or another possibility is that the water fog created by the first stage lox tank is so thick that it stop the flash from penetrating further down the illumination of the fairing suggests a detonation volume that must also be extending away from the rocket in the rockets direction the illumination of the strongbacks middle region also gives an idea about how far the detonation plume must extend away from the strongback ejecta analysis looks interesting too much later in the video still unburnt lox can be seen ejecting to the right without having any fuel to burn and turning into a white cloud as it freezes out moisture from the air its cold lox because it keeps going to the right not rising up like hot gases do heres my speculative conclusion based on that analysis i think the video supports an airfuel detonation scenario i just dont see how a copv failure cold have reached all those places so quickly and created all those specific shadows without also ejecting lox through the strongback in the first frame also lox alone is not enough to create an initial largevolume detonation fuel is also needed so i think the initially detonated mixture was necessarily fuelrich which supports a fuel leak or lower likelihood hydrazine as the root cause not a lox leak the pressure wave of the airfuel detonation pushed in the tank skin at around the common bulkhead which sheared the tank skin like a knife rupturing both the lox tank and the tank the fuelrich detonation died down after frame because it consumed all oxygen from the air in the volume of detonation the volume was still fuelrich at this point as the lox exited from the now ruptured lox tank it created the quick bright flash in frame as it consumed all quick sources of fuel not consumed by the initial detonation this kind of very bright flash is typical of lox rupture complete combustion of everything fuel this flash too dies down quickly because now all sources of fuel are gone but now both the lox and the tanks are ruptured catastrophically and the lox is falling down into the tank which creates the real big explosion and the subsequent avalanche of deflagration one problem with this scenario is that i dont know what ignited the original airfuel mixture is certainly not autoigniting nor particularly easy to ignite hydrazine could autoignite at room temperature with rust for example but theres very little chance that just moving the rocket vertical created a hydrazine leak in the satellite that was fueled with hydrazine possibly days or weeks before the incident shoutout for urayfound and
spacex,removed,first of all excellent analysis i do have to say your explanation of the explosion and following destruction seems the most likely so far as for the question of what ignites the fuel air mixture or where the fuel air mixture came for in the first place i would venture to guess that both are probably things that have been around for a while with events only just recently coming together to make an explosion possible i think the key to this explosion is having having fumes or spray and it seems to me in order to get the instantaneousness and power that we see higher oxygen content in the air is necissary i would venture to guess the source of the oxygen as being from the oxygen tank vents either on the strong back or the rocket itself as for the fumes or spray it seems less clear but a leak of some sourt on the strongback seems most likely if the were a fine spray or fumes were to mix with venting oxygen then it would be very volatile and any sourt of spark from any of the electrical equipment might have started the explosion the reason i believe the oxygen to be necissary is otherwise i would expect the fine spray or fumes would catch fire but would not create the powerful instantaneous explosion we see what do you think why did you delete your post urocket

spacex,removed,i am compelled to protest the design that you have put forth on the grounds that it looks like a giant butt plug also the crew compartment inside the mct spacecraft looks like some communist floor exercise the idea of a sea launch makes operations unnecessarily difficult it is my hope that the real mct stack has no resemblance to your description other than the cylindrical nature of the booster if i wasnt harsh enough i also upvoted your post so that more people will come to marvel at the furious brutality of your aesthetics you probably drive a nissan juke i shall limit my criticism for now not because it is unwarranted but out of the fear of your possible retaliation by painting the rocket black in all seriousness though good work i am a little underwhelmed by the way it looks but still thanks for sharing your idea

spacex,removed,i joined recently and posted a funny little post called gold on mars it was deleted and the mods actually showed me the number of reports it got including spam imho this community gets zero pussy
spacex,removed,this was a long time coming echologic is just way too personal with his moderation and it creates a system where everyone follows the rules but him what bothers me the most are all the accounts banned by echo in his personal fights with people that wont ever have a chance to be unbanned but it is great that going forward no one will have to deal with him anymore if he gets out of line or posts low effort posts he will not be moderated the same as everyone else and could see himself banned fairly
spacex,removed,probably will not be a popular opinion but i think religious people especially the ones that have a tendency to explode quite often should have their applications denied a lot of damage could be done in pressurized habitat if one has a strong wish for virgins
spacex,removed,i wouldnt share my wife either
spacex,removed,what is there really to work out echo basically made the mistake of treating a fellow moderator the same way he treats normal users in this sub as if he is the owner of the subreddit and everything goes through him echo for the longest time has gotten away with low effort posts and editorializing threads by hiding posts he didnt like rspacex was close to being rechologic this is a good day for the sub and his removal really does restore a sense of fairness to the moderation that users havent had the only downside are the accounts banned by echo over his personal spats that wont get the chance to be unbanned
spacex,removed,sounds like it is resolved just fine echo is out if they need more mods they should have an open call echo has acted more like an owner of the sub than just a moderator and this should be taken as an opportunity to move on if echo is truly capable of making nonlow effort posts then he should be able to continue posting just fine if he provides valuable content to this sub he can keep posting it he doesnt need to be a mod for that i just have a felling that echo not being a mod is going to mean he has very little to say because it is rare for him to have nonlow effort posts
spacex,removed,what goes on behind the scenes among the moderators should be kept there especially seeing this issue has a heavy personal emotional weight that is the last thing you want we dont need moderators to be a secret cabal they should be users that simply moderate too uechologic is a solid moderator possibly an overcommitted overemotional human arent most of us as a daily relaxed user who focuses more on my outside life i do notice the amazing effort he puts in this is a huge negative i thought you were about to go the correct way when you talked about how the dude was obsessed with moderation but you seem to be spinning it you should see it as a huge problem that this guy is so obsessed with moderation that isnt healthy he isnt paid to do this and he cant contribute as a user if his whole life is being a nanny he is in a spot where he acts like he owns the subreddit that is what came out when he fought with other mods this is really the perfect time to let him go and put out a call for new mods if new mods are needed dont let any one moderator be in a situation where they are putting in so much time moderating that it consumes them get some new mods in here the chance an obsessed person stay neutral and doesnt start pushing personal beliefs on others via moderation is slim to none echo bans lots of accounts and it always seems to be personal spats he gets into with other users just like the one he got into with wetmelon honestly my biggest surprise from him being fired is that i assumed he owned rspacex i am surprised someone else had the power to let him go at any time and only waited until now to do it
spacex,removed,echo just stop your own post history shows how poorly you have reacted to various situations you have said it yourself that your rl workload has increased now you are accusing a mod of using his status in such a way it is time you stepped down this is not it is and you cant hope to moderate a community of thousand that same way you did even a few years ago instead of the stress of moderating this community why not return to spacexstats i used that site because of the time zone difference it prevented me from missing several launches and it was obvious to me that you never had the time to actually make the site as awesome as you had wanted
spacex,removed,then why does he occasionally get into spats with individual users and ban them no other moderator does that just him echo has treated rspacex as if he owns it and what he says goes that is what we saw when he finally snapped on another moderator if echo truly posts high quality content then let him keep doing that he doesnt need to be a mod to do that if echo was truly a neutral mod that never abused his power then nothing should change at all with a new persons taking his place if you truly cared about echo as a person you would welcome this as it does appear he was quite obsessed with moderating on here and was spending lots of time doing it which isnt healthy they should put out an open call and get new moderators and try to avoid the situation where any one moderator takes ownership of the subreddit with overbearing moderation
spacex,removed,overbearing is not the same as essential a lot of his moderation is centered around his personal opinion of what low effort content is if you disagree with his personal opinion of low effort then you certainly would see his actions as wrong plus he does hold grudges and stalks users on his radar meaning your posts are even more likely to be hidden by him and he isnt even allowing other moderators the chance to even make a choice his way only after a few days of being on his radar you get banned i for one welcome echo being gone the only real issue are the accounts he banned that wont get unbanned
spacex,removed,i agree with your decision as based on actions that echo has made in public in the past i see no reason to doubt your account of the events and as a member of this community i ask that the mod team not consider bringing echo back on the team this community needs to move forward
spacex,removed,proving content to the subreddit has no bearing on whether he should be a mod or not i would argue top contributors make the worst mods because they have too much of an interest in favoring their content and opinions

spacex,removed,nobody else seeing an imperial colonization transport with only the earths elite on the last ark of hope as they escape a planet going through runaway chaotic global warming and chaotic climate change resulting in billion violent naked human ape megatroupes trapped on the ground stampeding in herds killing and laying waste to any threats to their local dog bowl ok thought not just checking
spacex,removed,suicidal people is nothing to be happy about
spacex,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit i took the challenge with so little information i present its ship model and for all spacex fans very high detailed model you can order a ship at shapeways the coloring is for aesthetic reasons only once you get your you can paint it footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
spacex,removed,just got another comment deleted for complaining about getting comments deleted in the meta thread about moderating issues i just made rdeletedspacex going to leave it all but unmoderated because nothing is better than this something
spacex,removed,lol you got that the other way round ive been lurking here since near the beginning ambiwlans always been the coolheaded adult echo was a yo kid he seemingly took under his wing and who steadily grew pretty bigheaded imo
spacex,removed,being a raging asshole to the other mods on slack is a good reason this sub is turning into a shitshow run by petty tyrants not sure that its time for a new sub yet
spacex,removed,this sub used to be one of the best moderated ones in all of reddit its a shame to see the team blow up like this and have the rest of the mods act this petty oh well all good things must come to an end
spacex,removed,it totally means dead and dying not that he is gone but because the mod team has been acting like ju high school basic bitches ill be checking the fb group first now and this second
spacex,removed,thanks for the snide reply glad you kids have everything all under control man you kids need to grow the fuck up
spacex,removed,but can you really play too much
spacex,removed,tossing the engine like a hot potato in the other the martian part
spacex,removed,the ksp player in me wants to string girders between those beauties throw a used dragon from mcgregor on top and launch aerodynamics and orbital mechanics be im off to mars
spacex,removed,all of them
spacex,removed,looks like we have another customer to send to orbit jeeves ah yes which falcon would you like to take today mr musk how about the dash we havent sent it up in a while now have we indeed very good sir
spacex,removed,and if anyone tailgates them they can just fire the rocket engines for a second to discourage them from driving so close
spacex,removed,i got room in my garage if he needs it
spacex,removed,dibs on
spacex,removed,all of them
spacex,removed,whoa you and uzlsa are twins
spacex,removed,whoa you and uzucal are twins
spacex,removed,vs good luck catching up blue origin
spacex,removed,good god was it ken m for those unaware rkenm
spacex,removed,looks like they brought back some space ghosts with them
spacex,removed,the world had more clarity in
spacex,removed,arent you guys just a cheery bunch
spacex,removed,were gonna need a bigger hanger
spacex,removed,i hear uechologic has some inside sources of a telephoneline facsimile sort
spacex,removed,whos account is elons alt for steering spacex discussion not sunfishtommy is it
spacex,removed,for curiosity i plugged echologic into an anagram generator ice oh clog and cog ho lice were some of the specimens that stood out then i realized i could rearrange the letters to spell hecogolic rather similar to hypergolic
spacex,removed,captain obvious here
spacex,removed,well you do get more science points generally when you physically bring it back versus transmitting it the big question is what will we learn from the mystery goo
spacex,removed,you mean like a hamster wheel
spacex,removed,my first though on this was quick load all the experiment data into the crew capsule before the kraken eats my ship maybe ive played too much kerbal space program
spacex,removed,you may be a moron but i now have new knowledge from the interesting replies so thanks
spacex,removed,spacex were running out of room for our boosters us what a wonderful problem to have
spacex,removed,mo money mo problems
spacex,removed,bioengineer methane eating humans instead
spacex,removed,yup gonna need a luggage strap
spacex,removed,i wonder if they roll their eyes too or if theyve drank too much of the koolaid
spacex,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvooaszyihalc
spacex,removed,but it sounds cool
spacex,removed,just
spacex,removed,nobody wants to talk about the elephant in the room of martian coal
spacex,removed,what a time to be alive
spacex,removed,one of crushed it
spacex,removed,falconed
spacex,removed,im reporting usavuporo as a replicant s
spacex,removed,its almost like it was written by fred lambert
spacex,removed,elons not the president of spacex gwynne shotwell is if anyone is gonna get shot well you can bet it wont be elon
spacex,removed,damn kids dont listen when asked nicely then play the victim when the tone ramps up i guess i can still be the same way with my wife asking me things
spacex,removed,ship come now
spacex,removed,ive seen a bunch of items about spacex and this shot before i saw this one and all made it clear that the launch was good the satellites all put into orbit yet when i read this title i did a double take as my mind read all satellites destroyed odd
spacex,removed,space fedex
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,a true nextgen experience
spacex,removed,comment
spacex,removed,yes we appear to be heading into another little ice age while the chicken littles are shouting that the sky is falling because
spacex,removed,i love you udecronym
spacex,removed,haha my bad
spacex,removed,peak pique
spacex,removed,i love that acronym
spacex,removed,yea except it would be occupy duna because ksp is the bomb
spacex,removed,they are starting to make it look easy now lol
spacex,removed,i believe legitimatesource as they agree with what i said so thats settled
spacex,removed,the business end
spacex,removed,first stage engines are apparently still good though so those might show up on a future launch you must be kidding thats gotta be the mother of all bad karma
spacex,removed,this is gold
spacex,removed,had to work during the launch so i couldnt watch it live congratulations spacex
spacex,removed,holy smokes what if this is actually elon
spacex,removed,too soon
spacex,removed,seriously youre starting to come off like an idiot im not saying you are but this trend toward ignorance and refusal to accept correct and accurate information are classic signs of an idiot look try this one more time does this thing have an engine no it has little aftermarket thrusters used for stationkeeping thats all best it could control is maybe knot current max and couldnt even move against a stiff breeze it must be towed everywhere it goes does it have a captain no theres no one on board can this thing cross an ocean only if it were carried on a ship would i take a ship into a storm absolutely done it a thousand times would i take this barge into heavy weather only if i want to make it whats called a bottomseeking submersible or artificial reef right now im hoping your just having some funor if not youve finally drilled down on this enough to know the difference if not then ive been explaining to someone who just cannot comprehend and perpetually has a mental banjo and an overbite going uhyuk
spacex,removed,ok copy the dumbass were done
spacex,removed,rtf still estimated be days elon time
spacex,removed,sam starfall the squid
spacex,removed,spacex got it wrong
spacex,removed,its also not really at risk from hurricanes yet
spacex,removed,hmmm speaking of walls someone aught to inform certain people of this scenario
spacex,removed,sick reference brah
spacex,removed,reusability is once again a hot topic following spacexs multiple landing demonstrations not to mention blue origins recent suborbital launchand landing feats as if this is somehow more amazing or even relevant for the af
spacex,removed,if spacex and their customers want full reuse they will have to build the facilities themselves such facilities would have to be quite large i would imaginequite possibly huge actually its hard to understand the value of being able to throw up five tons of payload a daybut you would need to do the math based on fixed capital investment sunk capital the cost of retrieval the cost of fuel the cost of transport refurbishment etc up front would say expect at least million just for the land permits basic infrastructure and hiring after that id say at leat a couple of billion for the facilities management training and execution and you still havent launched a single rocket yet spacex is not going to pay for any of that as they own reuse and the rockets alreadyand the government isnt going to pay for that either as they already have all the infrastructure and funding they need you will be paying them actually so besides satcoms what am i getting from outer space would be my question in theory you could build manufacturing for electronics in spacesuperconductors storage mediums microprocessors small batteries very high quality lens etc eyes on everything basically for here on terrestrial earth look at the size of the camera in your cell phone for exampleand the fact that it can create a feature length movie imagine being able to create a movie that could be recorded for years on a handheld device for fifty dollars gps enabled fully wireless with no plug for charging even monthly service fee of
spacex,removed,offers free purenclean coffee mug
spacex,removed,isnt that mars directly out from the rockets path
spacex,removed,and landing on an asds i desperately hope they name so much for subtlety
spacex,removed,and yet we tag him the bomb has been planted if any of you used to play counter strike back in the day youll get the reference
spacex,removed,id say you cant handle the bants lighten up
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,thats hilarious rofl
spacex,removed,make sure there arent any space rats
spacex,removed,leave it to the french
spacex,removed,when will they reply a first stage
spacex,removed,truly a prince of rocket engines
spacex,removed,sadly for space enthusiests that cant spot a fake post notice the rocket plume goes all the way to cloud line and it is thick and bushy that is from solid rocket boosters and that is either an atlas v delta iv or a shuttle launch the falcon only produces a contrail once it hits the upper atmo not from the ground up 😡
spacex,removed,quadriradial asymptotic multi micro port injectors lox ports annular to central no gold wagered because i dont think i have any and i just made that up with no reference to reality ☺
spacex,removed,never
spacex,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit it is very likely that the stream tomorrow will announce a mars mission is already underway with astronauts landing on mars before the year is out footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
spacex,removed,cool calculations thanks for doing this maybe its just me but i find this aspect particularly fascinating nozzleraptor isp earth nozzle sec so the worst sl isp figure of the raptor is going to be almost as good as the top mvac vacuum performance of secs wow the bfr is going to be such a monster booster
spacex,removed,because what else could they do for several months anyway gilmore girls binge
spacex,removed,doesnt sound like a plausible combination tbh xd
spacex,removed,the child i me hopes the presentation starts like httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyocbqlwmca
spacex,removed,elons team frantically inserting powerpoint slides into the raptor engine interesting propulsion method there
spacex,removed,program lacks thermodynamic values at subcooled temperatures the fuel is also used to cool the engines so its inlet temperature is above the storage temperature anyway it is common knowledge that rockets need cooling
spacex,removed,love the um
spacex,removed,a sacrifice to the goddess itar
spacex,removed,to be fair birds are dinosaurs of sort
spacex,removed,theyll design the pad the way they developed their rockets blow it up every launch and improve
spacex,removed,honestly couldnt care less
spacex,removed,somebody saw the original jurassic park i have been so psyched up for today
spacex,removed,holy christ
spacex,removed,aw yeah so hyped
spacex,removed,ooooh pretty
spacex,removed,oh my elon musk omem
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,to the mars
spacex,removed,holy shit
spacex,removed,incredible just mind buggeringly incredible
spacex,removed,looks like we can all fit so well meet at the launchpad
spacex,removed,its beautiful
spacex,removed,holy crap this is unbelievable
spacex,removed,its beautiful
spacex,removed,engines with lb of thrust
spacex,removed,this is what spaceships should look like that was the best thing ive ever watched
spacex,removed,setting us up for the decadeslong hypetrain
spacex,removed,oh my god
spacex,removed,i guess to make sure the hype is at the max when they get on the stage
spacex,removed,yes d
spacex,removed,thats the literal meaning of awesome
spacex,removed,everyone get on the hype train httpsfatgfycatcomactualfeistybettonggif
spacex,removed,this video got me a tear that is plainly epic
spacex,removed,that is just amazing my child could end up on mars and raise a family there
spacex,removed,holy shit i have no words
spacex,removed,that last bit gave me chills so excited
spacex,removed,hhhholy fuucck its here
spacex,removed,wow
spacex,removed,dont cry dont cry dont cry
spacex,removed,yes yes yes awesome era to be alive d
spacex,removed,well ill be damned anyone want to buy any organs andor small children asking usdone ticket on that thing
spacex,removed,i just cried a little it was good crying
spacex,removed,yeah that comes out to be awesome
spacex,removed,that is the answer to life the universe and everything
spacex,removed,wow
spacex,removed,i want to ride elons big dick
spacex,removed,yes this it yes i hope this video is just a taste of what we will see in less then two hours
spacex,removed,well now we know the question deep though was answering
spacex,removed,not very big is it the actual words that came from my wifes mouth i may be single on mars
spacex,removed,this gave me goosebumps
spacex,removed,the future is now
spacex,removed,thats just amazing
spacex,removed,its like a dream a scifi dream but this one may actually come true literally breath taking
spacex,removed,nice
spacex,removed,holy shit
spacex,removed,im going to watch this so many times is going to be ridiculous
spacex,removed,holy shit holy shit holy shit
spacex,removed,im tearing up man ive been waiting for this
spacex,removed,we can go beyond mars
spacex,removed,my socks just got blown off
spacex,removed,it blew everyone elses minds leaving him hanging
spacex,removed,fortyfrickinthree raptors
spacex,removed,this is amazing i hope they can pull this off
spacex,removed,oh my god its beautiful oh my gawd its so damn beautiful this is what i was waiting for
spacex,removed,holy this is it boys
spacex,removed,surpassed
spacex,removed,i just nerded everywhere
spacex,removed,the hype is real
spacex,removed,sweet mother of god this is fucking awesome
spacex,removed,and its off to boarding school on mars
spacex,removed,what a spectacular vehicle its truly incredible
spacex,removed,that thing looks like a goddamn spaceship holy crap
spacex,removed,you have the earth nozzle optimised for sea level pressure which means its suboptimal as soon as it lifts off generally first stage engines optimise for the average pressure over its flight profile
spacex,removed,i feel really emotional this is what weve been waiting for for a decade now its all coming together this isnt a scifi ship this is the real deal we live in the future
spacex,removed,engines douglas adams was right is the ultimate answer
spacex,removed,i have no words
spacex,removed,im almost in tears its so beautiful the styling and the music jist pulled all my emotions like a motherfucker
spacex,removed,new plan get it ready before next years inauguration
spacex,removed,im crying its so beautiful
spacex,removed,wow just wow still trying to cope with the fact that this not ksp but a presentation of what will become reality in the near future cant wait for that future
spacex,removed,please make it into the top page
spacex,removed,i got chills watching this i am so thrilled ill get ti witness this in my lifetime
spacex,removed,am i the only one nuts by this video its just more awesome than any prediction on rspacex
spacex,removed,mindblown this is definitelty going to happen sooner than you think im so excited for iac today and for mars tomorrow
spacex,removed,i think i might have peed a little
spacex,removed,rcrusaderkings disagree
spacex,removed,even when our lord and savior elon has died he has left a generation inspired and knowing that its possible to reach impossible goals thank you
spacex,removed,oh god someone like me i know what you feel bro
spacex,removed,no he means there was an interplanetary bypass built around his mindblowing expectations theres engines on this baby after all
spacex,removed,isnt this the civ vi outro
spacex,removed,hype train overbooked already please let me in please this is the freaking most awesome thing ever and the most evil thing one i saw minutes before the presentation
spacex,removed,well black box that solution for now
spacex,removed,twenty eight point seven million pounds of thrust excuse me while i glue my skull back together because my mind was just blown
spacex,removed,i cried
spacex,removed,how hype was that terraforming ending
spacex,removed,let me tell you ive been to mars ive been to mars a lot ive been all over mars and the thing about mars is its red you know why because the chinese are beating us when im president everyone will go to mars and its going to be a beautiful thing well paint that planet with white stripes and a field of stars and itll be beautiful
spacex,removed,dude
spacex,removed,pffft too young to explore the stars my ass im way too excited for this
spacex,removed,space planes
spacex,removed,my god its full of stars
spacex,removed,the last part where mars is being terraformed has definitely made me tear up
spacex,removed,erase email
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,oh my gosh
spacex,removed,easy fix make a magnetosphere
spacex,removed,my ex gf cheated with a male stripper at her friends hens night
spacex,removed,mother of god give up nasa you can never beat this
spacex,removed,she said she couldnt resist his body because of alcohol
spacex,removed,stop my transporter erector can only get so erect
spacex,removed,oh yes yes yes yus
spacex,removed,give this man a raise
spacex,removed,its not a rocket measuring contest of course but if it were there is now a clear winner
spacex,removed,some next level memes from mr musk d
spacex,removed,wow why is mars spinning so fast
spacex,removed,shotgun
spacex,removed,holy shit
spacex,removed,the booster should be named fits rather well
spacex,removed,i literally cried when i was watching this
spacex,removed,sign me up
spacex,removed,i hope this is all privately financed or gets alreadyallocated sls funding because it looks expensive the us is trillion in debt and theres no way we can afford this
spacex,removed,this definitely this
spacex,removed,the ultimate answer to life the universe and everything
spacex,removed,well apparently i have died and gone to heaven
spacex,removed,live stream starting soon damnit im going to die from hype overdose
spacex,removed,goosebumps
spacex,removed,the mars architecture will be a series of tunnels that can be opened and closed remotely each tunnel will provide and encompass a sequence of functions like maintaining the temperature providing mobility feeding power houses etc the tunnels will house chambers similar to ant colonies where dwelling zones will be made and areas segregate to avoid promulgation in case of failures materials for construction will be locally sourced but the groundwork will be done using materials ported from earth
spacex,removed,alright everyone float to the rear now
spacex,removed,unprofessional announcement delay wtf
spacex,removed,ticket price billion dollars
spacex,removed,confirmed musk is either a lost martian who just wants to get home or the best thing to happen to humanity since newton
spacex,removed,damn swedes theyve had it too good for too long
spacex,removed,ah you mean the elon suite
spacex,removed,so beautiful d
spacex,removed,this is gonna be totally random maybe they blew the to level the ground for new construction too much
spacex,removed,get off reddit get back to work
spacex,removed,if this becomes reality within my lifetime then i will be able to die a very happy individual
spacex,removed,or you know sketchy people from ula andor blue origin with sniper rifles
spacex,removed,i just wanna smoke weed in the basement
spacex,removed,yeah i saw it land plop a new payload and launch and all i could say was fuck me drunk
spacex,removed,love the trippy music
spacex,removed,future star citizen
spacex,removed,well of course that was why earth was built in order to tell what the question was in the first place
spacex,removed,the future is here hype
spacex,removed,good guy elon musk making a plan to terraform mars to save his ancient alien race
spacex,removed,starting soontm
spacex,removed,let your friends hear the lovely news fuck the haters
spacex,removed,i couldnt stop crying during the entire video everything i ever wished for the human species and that video shows the actual way it is going to happen
spacex,removed,i think he would be sorely disappointed to find himself in heaven
spacex,removed,whaaaat
spacex,removed,im crying reading that i dont even have kids yet
spacex,removed,official spacexhttpwwwspacexcommars
spacex,removed,im literally crying over here wtf crowd settel this was supposed to be a fucking hour aaaaarg
spacex,removed,huge
spacex,removed,more like the saturn v quantum oo
spacex,removed,i sat here and just said out loud musk you arrogant son of a bitch
spacex,removed,yes who wouldnt want to hide all their income from the irs so they can live in luxury on mars
spacex,removed,yes preorder now spaceships will ship the following week
spacex,removed,you forgot clean up the jizz from how fucking awesome this rocket is
spacex,removed,im sorry to be that guybut the solar panels are facing the wrong way
spacex,removed,brb crying and vomiting
spacex,removed,exterminate
spacex,removed,humans are stuck on earth he needs the stage presence of more than a human to convince billion people to fuck off to mars
spacex,removed,spaaaaccceeeee
spacex,removed,if trump wins im going to mars
spacex,removed,i am rock hard
spacex,removed,i came so hard i farted but seriously that was incredible is there hope for us after all
spacex,removed,porn buffering would be even worse
spacex,removed,weyland fucking yutani
spacex,removed,dont pay taxes afford travel to mars
spacex,removed,lol did your mom bring you chicken nuggets too
spacex,removed,aahahahahahahahahaa somebody pinch me i must be dreaming
spacex,removed,just in time for the arrival of the new hyperspace bypass
spacex,removed,damn it i hate it when the trailer gives away the whole movie
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,im going to need to contact my doctor because this erection is not going away
spacex,removed,do you know what i was doing that day billy that day elon promised he was going to change the future of mankind i was redditing billy i was redditing
spacex,removed,elon musk is peter weyland holy shit
spacex,removed,that thing is fucking huge
spacex,removed,this is some star wars shit right here i havent seen a piece of technology this intriguing since the original iphone
spacex,removed,one damn sexy video
spacex,removed,is hillary clinton a cylon
spacex,removed,space x can barley get off the planet and youre all ready to call them visionaries because they made some nice cgi you people are really up your own asses in this subreddit
spacex,removed,accidentally was playing worlds apart by seven lions in the background on my laptop thought it was part of the video made me cry
spacex,removed,lmao are you actually serious
spacex,removed,anything is possible when you render a cg of what you think will impress people on a project that will only come to fruition in twenty years literally meaningless pr this is no mans sky on steroids
spacex,removed,yep you just stumped elon musk s
spacex,removed,doctor you mentioned the ratio of ten women to each man now wouldnt that necessitate the abandonment of the socalled monogamous sexual relationship i mean as far as men were concerned regrettably yes but it is you know a sacrifice required for the future of the human race i hasten to add that since each man will be required to do prodigious service along these lines the women will have to be selected for their sexual characteristics which will have to be of a highly stimulating nature elon musk is dr strangelove i knew it
spacex,removed,dontwanttoliveonthisplanetanymore not because im being driven off by anything the idea of living on another planet just seems awesome
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,make sure you always have your towel because you never know when a herd of perfectly normal beasts will be coming through
spacex,removed,how fast do we have to spin mars before it terraforms
spacex,removed,life insurance
spacex,removed,seems like weve beat the shit out of it
spacex,removed,listen to this guygal
spacex,removed,after the debates last night see you on mars
spacex,removed,zero g games movies cabins a restaurant youll have a great time
spacex,removed,what a time to be alive
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,its refreshing to see there are still people out there who are actually creative especially within the stemtard fields
spacex,removed,did anyone else notice the end mars getting greener
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,mars colonists to do list survive build habitat grow food build way home
spacex,removed,i just came
spacex,removed,get yo ass to maars
spacex,removed,all i want is to live long enough to watch the first person born on mars im
spacex,removed,the solar collectors are almost completely perpendicular to the sun for the whole flight i wouldnt trust these people
spacex,removed,this cant be accurate the rocket didnt explode in the beginning
spacex,removed,fukin do it man
spacex,removed,to escape their father
spacex,removed,wow thats beautiful
spacex,removed,heard it as three times more thrust than a melon
spacex,removed,if you go to in the video the two ships touch tips
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,i came
spacex,removed,be a space janitor
spacex,removed,soon tm
spacex,removed,and hope you dont get stuck next to all the way there
spacex,removed,lmao this guy
spacex,removed,cringe overload
spacex,removed,omg that question
spacex,removed,and heres me struggling with algebra
spacex,removed,based on what your vast experience
spacex,removed,i really want to say something along the lines of have you met their parents but ill refrain
spacex,removed,who is that retard
spacex,removed,this guy asking elon a questiontsk tsk
spacex,removed,did anyone else get goosebumps
spacex,removed,i checked their job postings a while back and they were looking for a barista
spacex,removed,thank you musk and spacex so fucking much my dreams are literally coming true before my eyes awestruck right now
spacex,removed,this is insane in a good way
spacex,removed,im wasted at oktoberfest and the polizei are playing the final coutdown over the pa its beautiful i hope i live to see this
spacex,removed,theres a frood who really knows where his towel is
spacex,removed,what a fucking idiothow about the shit he came from a pseudoenvironmentalist angle lets not waste any water but being ignorant he just sounded dumb you know what aldo you can use shit to grow thingsand there is as far as we know at this point no real ecosystem to pollute he did sound like hes on drugs but most likely was just dumb
spacex,removed,rule of science on reddit never ask questions
spacex,removed,i hope you win
spacex,removed,when itar lets us you stupid fucks
spacex,removed,russian girl getting rekt
spacex,removed,oh fuck off russia get your own spacex
spacex,removed,fuck you
spacex,removed,cringing fucking hard here
spacex,removed,what is wrong with these idiots
spacex,removed,ill do my part and break your arms
spacex,removed,and i thought the debate was bad
spacex,removed,questions not essays
spacex,removed,questions not essays
spacex,removed,stop advertising your content
spacex,removed,squadron
spacex,removed,these questions are embarrassing i am cringing so hard right now who the hell let these halfwits into the room
spacex,removed,what a load of nonsense
spacex,removed,jesus christ the qa please dont just let anyone grab that mic can i give you my comic
spacex,removed,jesuswhats with some of these questions is any idiot allowed in there one guy suggested that michael cera should be the first human on mars
spacex,removed,i got dibs on top bunk
spacex,removed,everyone is plugging their own businesscomicwebsite or their own interests getting hired what the fuck is going on elon is trying to get us to mars and has to put up with this shit
spacex,removed,when does quaid start the reactor
spacex,removed,holy fucking shit so god damn beautiful im crying 😭
spacex,removed,i mean i was like at burning man this year and i got really drunk and saw shit everywhere so yeah toilets
spacex,removed,to the kid from funny or die and his question about sending michael cera to mars your joke wasnt funny
spacex,removed,really all the hype has gone down this qa the girl asking right now is pure cancer
spacex,removed,a moveable launch pad seems the most simple
spacex,removed,commenting so i can look back and say i was part of motherfucking history
spacex,removed,what the fuck is with this qa
spacex,removed,whats with these questions funny or die and rooster teeth just committed pr suicide well maybe not suicide but those two questions are like badges of shame between these shit questions and the people waving at the cameras i feel like this deserves a much more serious setting
spacex,removed,those rednecks trying to be funny
spacex,removed,radiation will not be a big deal elon musk uhm oookeyyy
spacex,removed,where is rkerbalspaceprograms recreation
spacex,removed,trumps hate him
spacex,removed,dang elon got some sick moves
spacex,removed,the questions from the audience made me cringe i cant believe people waste valuable qa time with their nonsense
spacex,removed,it would sure be nice if elon has some followup interviews or already predone qa with some actually informed media that qa was a total disaster
spacex,removed,im so happy i get to live to see this
spacex,removed,these sorts of questions is what happens when you hold a conference in mexico
spacex,removed,ikr he gets the world leader in private space travel has one questions to ask him and thats the one he goes for what a piece of garbage
spacex,removed,elon let me mouth touch you
spacex,removed,um what is this anyone can put together a computer animation of something doesnt make it reality
spacex,removed,someone link me to that autistic qa session plox
spacex,removed,i was especially infuriated by the fact that someone wasted a valuable question on promoting their own electrical bus its pretty cool and all but its a conference for spacex and not tesla
spacex,removed,screw that guy who wasted time plugging his startup
spacex,removed,not gonna lie it moved
spacex,removed,elon musk is lives the geek life we dreamed of when we were well still do actually
spacex,removed,those qa was really cringeworthy
spacex,removed,seriously what the hell were those questions im surprised iac didnt do some sort of questions regulation to make sure people dont ask to work for spacex
spacex,removed,they didnt vet any of them and basically let stoners and self promoters ask the dumbest questions ive ever heard only a couple were actually technical or good
spacex,removed,it was honestly the leddit crowd today i honestly want to shoot myself after seeing this musk will recover but i honestly hope the burning man dude and the russian lady as well as the electric bus dude all die in a horrible firecar crash
spacex,removed,crap you beat me to this question
spacex,removed,ugh whats up with the hecklers in the audience asking stupid questions and pushing products
spacex,removed,i was hoping to see schematics of the passenger quarters wouldve been nice to see where matt damon would stay
spacex,removed,seriously awful questions fucking mars toilet im literally dumbfounded
spacex,removed,they just blast flight of the valkyries louder than the engines so now nobody goes deaf due to engine noise
spacex,removed,brick no hit back bloodsport
spacex,removed,i guess they cant control the audience and at least there were a handful of good questions just goes to show that some parts of humanity probably dont deserve to go to mars
spacex,removed,i wouldnt have kept my composure with tommy chong asking dumbass questions like that
spacex,removed,nope look at the makeup of our country and world whites are disappearing at high rates blm raza india chinese all these groups are against progress they are committing genocide while we try to build a better world gg
spacex,removed,you forgot wrap a wet one around your head like a turban to hide yourself from michael ironside before you get your ass to mars
spacex,removed,rip
spacex,removed,yay smart people
spacex,removed,thatd been a good question at qa among a lot others what a sad turn
spacex,removed,thats why you use httpswwwslido and let the audience ask anonymously and selfmoderate
spacex,removed,hey who stole my underpants
spacex,removed,just remember reddit no preorders
spacex,removed,gushing right now
spacex,removed,yup that man is like from a science fiction novel as much as i cant believe that trump is real because he looks like a comic book villain i cant believe that elon musk exists id work as a shit cleaner in spacex as aldo the autistic boy said if it means that im contributing the world would be far better off if people dreamt at night of becoming elon musk instead of some jing jing coke rapper
spacex,removed,huh til that meme originally comes from south park
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,those questions reminded me why id like to get off this planet
spacex,removed,i cant believe they didnt prevet the questions
spacex,removed,too bad the qa session got wasted on useless mundanities
spacex,removed,youre right i think is more likely
spacex,removed,i prefer just the washing machine instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry
spacex,removed,they can even join fraternaties now
spacex,removed,would you rather have loans or regrets
spacex,removed,oh come on man but funny or die drove million views with clinton and zack g you know elon needs that kind of publicity barely anyone has heard of elon musk and spacex
spacex,removed,so just real life kerbal space program finally
spacex,removed,he is the next generation in dancing technology elons next startup dancex
spacex,removed,i would have a hard time resisting the urge to punch people if i sat in that audience
spacex,removed,oh no
spacex,removed,then why dont planes have multiple engines in case one fails check mate liberals
spacex,removed,vaporwear downvote
spacex,removed,they have an abusive father
spacex,removed,i cant wait to be able to recreate this in kerbal space program
spacex,removed,lololololololololololol
spacex,removed,have you not seen walle this is the future damnet
spacex,removed,jesus be a little more of a downer why dont you
spacex,removed,write about it on your tumblr
spacex,removed,people ship runs out of stststubville
spacex,removed,what ksp mod are they using
spacex,removed,so when does this game come out
spacex,removed,maga im so glad we have amazing people like elon musk
spacex,removed,please someone recreate this in kerbal space program
spacex,removed,am i the only one crying
spacex,removed,i know right like whos the asshole who scalped those tickets to those fucking assclowns
spacex,removed,dude im that was the best scifi movie ive ever seen im going to be watching humans and robots live it up on the mars base when im and fucking love it
spacex,removed,doesnt seem realistic just a bunch of hype to get internet fan boys worked up looks like they succeeded
spacex,removed,not happening
spacex,removed,that gave me chills i honestly cant believe were actually going to inhabit another fucking planet the human race is fucking incredible﻿ according to the youtube comments this is happening
spacex,removed,someone explain to me why im crying
spacex,removed,aaaaaaaand im back to playing kerbal space program
spacex,removed,if the first restaurant on mars is not called milliways i will be dissapointed
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,after watching the trumpclinton debate debacle last night im glad to see this and be optimistic about the future again
spacex,removed,things that will never ever happen this
spacex,removed,were going to mars bbaabyy
spacex,removed,this has to be fully privately funded were trillion in debt as a country and have to take care of america first
spacex,removed,yeah i loved how it was all like aw yeah were gonna go to fucking mars and shit and then at the end btw were gonna terraform it too mic drop
spacex,removed,this is the real picture
spacex,removed,hows this for high quality
spacex,removed,sir you may want to take a look at this radar
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,this science is like religion futurism now
spacex,removed,i cried tears of pure joy watching this
spacex,removed,never before has a video about space travel given me an erection i can now cross that off my list
spacex,removed,they open the door and start throwing out stuff like spare tires anvils and barrels of rum
spacex,removed,me too those shits are expensive
spacex,removed,this makes me want to scream
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,and lets not forget do you want to ride in my electric bus and the other two people promoting their companies
spacex,removed,their immune system will be just fine penicillin in nearly years old and it is doing just fine a few agents have developed a way to break down the active ingredient beta lactams and via plasmids they share that technology to a few other agents resistance is to the drug and it is a very small issue in this context again the changed immune system is due to the antibiotic not in any way due to the immune system itself immunology is a massive topic and i am far more worried about my garbage can becoming sentient and attacking me in the middle of the night than the notion that years is more than enough time for the immune system to evolve several species away sorry to sound arrogant but its just a ridiculous concern
spacex,removed,they shoulda given echo the job of vetting the questions he woulda sorted the bastards out
spacex,removed,step steal underpants lol
spacex,removed,ok judging by the quality of morons at that qa i may have to concede my assumption that mars colonists would consist of the highly skilled intelligent and insightful perhaps a screening process to ensure that those employed as telephone sanitizers cant get onboard
spacex,removed,does it have a bar
spacex,removed,these handful of daft questions did not take up too much time mr musk quickly moved on
spacex,removed,regarding the imho weird funding slide is it just a non funny httpknowyourmemecommemesprofit to an old south park episode or is there some kind of implicit message steal underpants launch satellites send cargo and astronauts to iss kickstarter profit the meme doesnt make any sense when you exclude the and also kickstarter isnt even part of the meme or imo a probable way of funding this sorry if this is too tin foil but i think theres something here slskp space launch system killer program again if this is to farfetched please remove comment
spacex,removed,made me shed a tear
spacex,removed,gawds if the first ship is named heart of gold i think the second needs to be named the b ark and we put most of the people from the qa on it
spacex,removed,funny or die im dead
spacex,removed,dont forget using it to avoid the gaze of the ravenous bugblatter beast a mindbogglingly stupid animal it assumes that if you cant see it it cant see you — daft as a brush but very very ravenous
spacex,removed,found the ksper 😊
spacex,removed,that is a really nice ship its so nice i believe id like to steal it
spacex,removed,attempting to read your comment gave me cancer
spacex,removed,there are diamonds in my pants
spacex,removed,get your ass to mars
spacex,removed,would it be wrong to say that this is the sort of thing that gets me off
spacex,removed,yeah sure
spacex,removed,a towel is about the most massively useful thing a interstellarhitchhiker can have partly it has great practical value
spacex,removed,i think i just gain an extra chromosome watching this
spacex,removed,i doubt his bus is seeing much fucking
spacex,removed,ot lets just hope the probe doesnt go to mandyville waves at the other westwing fans out there
spacex,removed,surly they need to folow scott manleys sugestion to land rocket directly in hangar to save time xd any way cant wait to see that rocket fly again
spacex,removed,elon musk is spock
spacex,removed,boss to employees ok guys who wants to wash the rocket today just wheel it on out over there
spacex,removed,and i think thats where spacex will have a big upper hand theyre going to be years ahead of their competitors into this new market for cheap launches so theyll be the sole provider for all of these new customers theres so many different possibilities like spacexs proposed internet satellite constellation which are only going to continue to grow as global communications technology spreads and advances i really cant imagine a situation where launches because so cheap and readily available that spacex runs out of customers to fill them
spacex,removed,july elon right now behind me
spacex,removed,pelvic inflammatory disease
spacex,removed,government launches ie nasa nro usaf are substantially underwriting spacex outgoings the next tranche of iss cargo flights should cost for example add to that the development money they receive from nasa and usaf should allow spacex to balance the books falcon costs to build if the orbcomm flights are anything to go by so ten commercial flights nett another assuming no additional charges of course reusability should produce even more revenue per flight so finances are of much less concern than technical challenges such as completing dragon and designing mct architecture
spacex,removed,from the amazon toally missed an opportunity to say buy good from amazon in the amazon
spacex,removed,i know its still a long way off but the potential satellite business would be the cash cow if you look at telecom companies like verizon att etc they have market caps in the billion range assuming the current valuation from the google equity purchase last year of around billion if spacex could even become half the telecom player as the major companies that would be a increase of their current valuation
spacex,removed,no theyre getting beaten to mars
spacex,removed,race to witch mons
spacex,removed,please
spacex,removed,actually you didnt because nasa isnt ever going to really try to put humans there
spacex,removed,chicken
spacex,removed,this is exactly what my siblings and i would say about four seconds before losing any race
spacex,removed,cant wait for when elon goes to mars first so bezoss fourth rocket is new musk
spacex,removed,whats with the us need to screw everyone
spacex,removed,thats a bit too much are we thanking the romans for building the foundation of modern politics are we all thanking everyone for the huge ammount of people diying of starvation rape drug abuse and so many other problems in the world mankind did all this i dont like this noam chomsky way of seeing things
spacex,removed,more speculation from his customers passed off as news why do all the mods of spacex groups around the net think we will just believe anything they say at face value without a shred of evidence and worse is that they are most often incorrect remember when he insisted that returned booster hot fire test was only seconds when it was min oh wait that was the mods here too and then they banned the video the evangelists of spacex faith faith faith
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,forced censorship is hardly a oasis comments should be debated and accepted or discarted in here they are deleted i keep coming here because of the ppl in here not because of the power system
spacex,removed,the people whining about luckey had mostly been whining about him ever since oculus were bought by facebook theyd use any excuse to attack him
spacex,removed,please explain i didnt say i didnt say i didnt accept any part of an inversion i dont think i did anyway ill go back and look theme song from jeopardy playing ok i looked nope i didnt say anything about accepting or denying any type of inversion
spacex,removed,do they have any used rockets looking for a cool man cave for my backyard
spacex,removed,oh tshirts
spacex,removed,where in no im kidding even in the us its which is kind of steep nowadays
spacex,removed,getting permits to land the delivery falcon in your front yard is expensive
spacex,removed,for a second i thought this was a booster sale
spacex,removed,anyone else thought for a moment that they can get a falcon launch for off
spacex,removed,how much for a rocket
spacex,removed,so off a mars ticket
spacex,removed,its via rocket
spacex,removed,does the off include launch services
spacex,removed,can i get off a falcon heavy
spacex,removed,oh on merchandise that makes sense i was hoping to book my ticket to mars today
spacex,removed,does this include launch services now that would be a cyber monday sale out of this world
spacex,removed,i thought it was off on the million dollar rockets i am a moron
spacex,removed,i totally thought it was a discount on actual launches before i clicked on the link i was like how can they afford to lower the price that much on a rocket launch
spacex,removed,only a discount on the clothes and not the launches themselves lame
spacex,removed,they must be sold out of falcon
spacex,removed,how much for a falcon
spacex,removed,thought this mean the rockets
spacex,removed,but theyre in the delivery business
spacex,removed,i wonder if i can get off a launch id even take a reused booster
spacex,removed,prices look unchanged to me httpwwwspacexcomaboutcapabilities
spacex,removed,i definitely thought this would be an excellent deal if i had needed to send a satellite to space then i clicked the link and saw tshirts
spacex,removed,does this mean i can have a satellite launched for million joking aside im definitely getting in on that sale d
spacex,removed,too bad its not tesla
spacex,removed,i assumed the sale was on a satellite launch or iss resupply mission
spacex,removed,in that case the silk road didnt get busted oh wait
spacex,removed,whats off a falcon come out to be before and after shipping
spacex,removed,does the sale apply to their rockets too ive been looking into buying a falcon to put up my own space station
spacex,removed,so i could get a launch to gto for only about mil
spacex,removed,drat here i was hoping id be able to purchase my own doubt those will be part of a sale anytime soon
spacex,removed,whats the launch discount i need to get something to leo
spacex,removed,can i get off a trip to mars
spacex,removed,ah a cyber monday sale on merchandise i thought they had their rocket launches on sale
spacex,removed,does it apply to their launches too if so at million maybe i could finally consider a booster for myself only need to earn mill
spacex,removed,dude there are on the spacex merch store
spacex,removed,weird i visited the website and im still seeing the regular prices of million for a falcon launch and million for a falcon heavy launch httpwwwspacexcomaboutcapabilities
spacex,removed,just pop them out the window for seconds
spacex,removed,i would love a spacex polo shirt but the delivery to the uk is as much as the item so simply dont bother
spacex,removed,i thought the sale was for launching their rockets hahaha i didnt even know they had clothing for sale
spacex,removed,holy fuck getting single tshirt delivered to brasilia i would pay
spacex,removed,no sale on leo satelittes prices
spacex,removed,are the falcon sold out already
spacex,removed,that is only million per falcon
spacex,removed,came here looking for off on a launch leaving disappointed
spacex,removed,even tesla sells models touche
spacex,removed,who wants to go in on a falcon with me if we pool our money we can get a million dollar rocket for million then we resell it to ses for and split the million in profit
spacex,removed,read ops title and thought elon was offering off for satellite launches
spacex,removed,dammit i want to see the box unfold place the item on your floor then use rocket engines to get back to the shipping facility where it lands softly on a barge floating in a bathtub on the roof
spacex,removed,whats the regular price of a falcon like million i think ive read off is good savings
spacex,removed,how much for interplanetary shipping to mars
spacex,removed,you better not be hating on my caine distro froth
spacex,removed,stop focusing on the people that contributed nothing it doesnt help you doesnt raise anybody or anything up and makes you sound like a chauvinistic asshole
spacex,removed,perhaps you would be more comfortable in rpolitics as theres plenty of lively discussion about the merits of capitalism there this subreddit is not the place for you to complain about noam chomsky its the place to discuss technical details and news about spacex
spacex,removed,wat
spacex,removed,tnx for proving my point
spacex,removed,so what is the point again you want to interpret word by word with every possible scrutiny you can withou atacking the argument itself
spacex,removed,similar to tony stark and pepper potts
spacex,removed,so thats her who will start the kickstarter
spacex,removed,also discounts on some of the litler things may add up our exercise bikes are used on mars in return for free fitness gear our brand of widgets as used inn spaaace
spacex,removed,certainly you can have the first launch just as long as youre paying more than they are
spacex,removed,i dont know what fh means so i just went with fuck house makes only about more sense to me
spacex,removed,the fact that they felt they needed to go public with this is just gamesmanship i dont think the spacex relationship is one they should be fucking with but corporate culture is all about shortterm profits i can imagine how much worse this bullshit would be if spacex were a public company musk is wise to keep the myopic bitches on wall street away from it
spacex,removed,first casualty of the mars colonisation projet
spacex,removed,nah man you should see it its got this really cool multi layered fountain out front and progressive fun styling there are always these chicks washing cars out back and they even offer free lunches to passerbys once elon himself came out and gave me such a great office building
spacex,removed,ad astra donald
spacex,removed,thats one big fucking tank
spacex,removed,sure they are going to dick around with densified propellants in humidity
spacex,removed,there are more guns in florida
spacex,removed,you are making the explicitly partisan attack in case that wasnt obvious to you as it was to virtually everyone else you went out of your way to claim that liberals attacked gingrich when in fact many romney surrogates did as well and to then demand that the op produce a liberal commentator who walked some fine line of condemning gingrich during an election cycle while not condemning the idea of a lunar colony so no youre not fighting against ignorance youre merely blaming liberals for mocking what was in fact a completely mockable politician for making a rather boneheaded remark and his suggestion that the us taxpayer alone shoulder the burden of a permanentlycrewed outpost on the moon with up to people on it during the recovery from the greatest recession in almost a century while running for president but mainly because it was newt gingrich who is to many of every political persuasion something of a joke in human form so im not the one making it into a partisan fight by accusing liberals and then demanding clips from saturday night live or any other liberal commentator you are the one who made this overtly political and if youre such a complete partisan hack that you cant understand that then i am certainly not going to engage in any sort of reasoned conversation with you about the topic if youd like to withdraw your comments about liberals and your gross generalizations about how liberals feel about space exploration in general or manned spaceflight in particular youre welcome to it because its conservatives who constantly screw with nasas budget and who dictate porkbarrel wastes of time and money like the sls its not the senate launch system for nothing and who are opposed to funding anything without offsetting cuts in social programs elsewhere just never the sacrosanct military budget so go ahead continue making this partisan because i can certainly have that debate or apologize for the attacks on liberals and we can move on
spacex,removed,not gonna ask anything but will sure as hell read everything he writes
spacex,removed,so i was at burning man and i was thinking how much it must be like mars will mars have toilets yep pretty sure nobody asked that yet d
spacex,removed,i think im gonna be asleep
spacex,removed,can i give you a kiss
spacex,removed,in that case i guess its bedtime
spacex,removed,i just want to tell him i went to burning man
spacex,removed,upar se monday bc monday
spacex,removed,so i was at burning man
spacex,removed,great now hes gonna go at this gattacastyle
spacex,removed,me toohmmm
spacex,removed,so i was at burning man last year
spacex,removed,as a person with a life im going to spend the day gaming maybe doing some housework and read the whole thing when its over i have nothing to add to the conversation and i value my time watching words appear on a screen is infinitely less interesting than actually doing something of my own
spacex,removed,thats it im gonna have to miss classes tomorrow
spacex,removed,well as long as you dont ask about burning man or michael cera itll probably be fine
spacex,removed,electric rockets ok
spacex,removed,hey thats my birthday
spacex,removed,ooh now ill get a chance to tell him about my electric rv just kidding
spacex,removed,upvote for irish d
spacex,removed,what are your thoughts on the em drive that has been gaining an increasing amount of buzz in recent years especially now that several independent labs have released research suggesting they do in fact generate thrust
spacex,removed,so what you are saying is that youll delete my question if i ask was the release date is for the ultimate musk industries hybrid device a solar powered flying car with autopilot
spacex,removed,questions not essays
spacex,removed,honey could you empty the cat box outside please
spacex,removed,added
spacex,removed,added
spacex,removed,i dont think this is a spacex related question
spacex,removed,is someone asking if he plays ksp im asking him
spacex,removed,no but there was one about an idea for a comic that entailed one of the biggest load of bullshit i have ever heard brace yourself
spacex,removed,why not link the iac video
spacex,removed,agreed
spacex,removed,get off your high horse
spacex,removed,what lessons have you learned from the last space race and how can we be more efficient this time around big fan here 👋
spacex,removed,at least nobody was a level genius this time
spacex,removed,no wonder he wants to die on mars
spacex,removed,questions from me where on mars are you going to build the first base closer to the poles where there is water or closer to the equator where the temperature is less extreme one of the most difficult things to build on earth are things like cpus to power computers will that be one of the biggest challenges for the early mars society always having outdated cpus and hoping to get to the critical size to make it feasible to build this kind of factories on mars or do you see bigger problems does terminal velocity at the mars poles give enough energy to start the fusion process of hydrogen quick warming plan or do you plan to use the plentiful available uranium on mars as part of the ignition for that but in that case are you not concerned with nuclear pollution who is going to organise land ownership and zoning on mars
spacex,removed,youre very respectful lol
spacex,removed,elon thank you for doing this qa session and for your contributions to sciencesociety technologys progress faces numerous obstacles from an uncountable quantity of sources what has been the biggest obstacle youve faced since the founding of spacex and to follow that what do you forsee being the biggest obstacle in the future
spacex,removed,hello elon musk first off id like to thank you for doing this ama when humans first arrive on mars what measures would be put into place to protect them i dont mean to talk about the martian but at spacex is anastronauts the number priority or is furthering the mission
spacex,removed,mr musk a sperm whales body contains a diverse set of microscopic life if one were to be spread violently across the surface of mars it could jeopardize the prospects of future scientific studies on the mars ecosystem have you put any thought into protecting mars from contamination by sperm whales petunias or even the bacteria present in the human body do you consider the preservation of martian sterility as secondary to the goal of preserving the human species as a follow up have you put any thoughts into the types of drinks which will be served to passengers on the way to mars
spacex,removed,how much faith did you loose in humanity after your last question and answer session
spacex,removed,im a space physicist with expertise in space weather prediction i am concerned about the column of water solution regarding solar eruptions not gcrs as radiation is mostly isotropic all directions at maybe with more coming in from sunfacing side so the column of water is only decreasing radiation for passengers and crew by assuming a box shape spacecraft i am working on a nasa contract for a radiation prediction system that will help work in conjunction with better radiationdesign spacecraft and radiation hardened materials my team is looking for a letter of support to maximize our chances to win the phase ii award which will bring about the systems operational capability i know spacex likes to do almost everything independently but given how complicated space weather is and understanding the impacts of radiation i think taking a team approach is vital for the best chances of surviving and sustainable living in the extraterrestrial environments nasa will verify this work to spacex sprints can you help with the letter of support
spacex,removed,do you have any plans to travel into space yourself
spacex,removed,hi what motivates you and drives you to wake up in the morning even though you know some goals are extremely hard to reach thanks
spacex,removed,what is your biggest fear in the coming future
spacex,removed,did you ever had any problems with concurence did any nation space program ever tried to hold you back or making your work harder even thou we have some eperience with living in space we have almost knowledge on living and surviving on other planets what do you think will be biggest difficulties for first settlers to occur after landing on mars how many years will pass untill we would be able to safely and confidentaly say that we are living on mars and how many years until the price of moving will drop id say demand is quite big how are we going to care of garbage and all the things we use are there some thing we must be really carefull that could contaminate surface even for example our viruses and microorganisms like europeans going to america how will it go with direct democracy once there will be more pople there and with that naturaly some with desire for power any books you would recommend about setteling on mars or planets in particulary more in problem solvingphilosophysocial term thanks for all the answers i bope this is not the closest i will ever get to you and will once have a chance to talk with you in person since there is so manny things i would like to chat about cheers
spacex,removed,what lessons have you learned from the last space race and how can we be more efficient this time around big fan here 👋
spacex,removed,im a british year old with autism and a love for spacecomputerselectronics kind of guy who could do an year stint in space with little to no realtime human contact what chance do you think i have of one day setting for on mars also was raptors a coincidence or yet another hitchhikers joke
spacex,removed,which questions do you most want us to ask you
spacex,removed,hey elon i have a couple questions concerning medical necessities on mars how many medical professionals do you plan on having go on the first couple of trips how do you plan on dealing with sickness say if a viral infecction were to break loose in the colony how do you plan on dealing with the effects of reduced gravity and potentially increased radiation on the human body over extended periods and lastly the awkward but necessary question sexual relationships on mars are bound to happen and will potentially be very casual in nature considering there may be little to do at first what do you envision as a solution to control the spread of stds and assuming someone can get pregnant in low gravity how would you overcome possible complications during birth if we want to colonize mars being able to have healthy children will be a necessity sorry this was so long and thank you for your consideration and doing this ama
spacex,removed,yo waddup elon how much faith did you loose in humanity after your last question and answer session
spacex,removed,what kind of missions flights need to happen before first humans can go
spacex,removed,hi elon do you believe in ufos
spacex,removed,when did you decided you wanted to colonize mars
spacex,removed,hi elon thanks for doing this ama have you thought about a worldwide foundation collecting donations for funding the first ten billion needed
spacex,removed,what do you think of westworld so far
spacex,removed,no question here just a big thanks for being a visionary and pushing for actual progress thank you
spacex,removed,do you ever plan to make electric wheeler trucks or commercial airplanes with tesla
spacex,removed,hi elon ive heard you explain your decision to pursue mars colonization as a process in which you considered the ways that you can have the greatest positive impact for humanity i see that this project fulfills this criterion and admire the endeavor but ive always wondered did you consider a project to address serious poverty hunger or disease directly why not pursue these it seems that these would fulfill the criterion at least as well possibly better due to immediate need and that they are areas that could benefit from serious resources and technological innovation
spacex,removed,why do you pay orders of magnitude less than other companies
spacex,removed,i volunteer myself
spacex,removed,hey elon considering its turn on ad how are you gonna assure us a science victory before time runs out
spacex,removed,hi elon where do i sign up to become a martian thanks in advance
spacex,removed,any chance i can get a hello also how are you today
spacex,removed,also thats a pretty huge contract with toray wow must be enough carbon fiber for quite a fleet of rockets
spacex,removed,elon if you could have the first words on mars do you have any idea what you would say
spacex,removed,how will the logistics look like how will cargo be loaded into the ship on mars everything will be lowered with cranes will people need to enter the cargo bay or it will be robotic will the containers be repurposed for example as building material
spacex,removed,you surely are an ama fan
spacex,removed,this is the kind of question id want to see here theres so much stuff from people who clearly havent read up on anything but just know elon mars
spacex,removed,will its booster technologies be used or tested on for instance return to launch pad mounting a new with new payload
spacex,removed,what do you think of asgardia
spacex,removed,hi elon a common critique of manned mars missions is the radiation that the astronauts will encounter both during traveling and on mars how will spacex minimize the effects of radiation on the passengers of the its
spacex,removed,hey elon for earthlings what will be the social implications of having human life on a second planet within our solar system thanks for all your hard work
spacex,removed,hi elon what is the current plan to effectively colonize mars whats next how do you feel spacex would fare with substantially more funding upwards of increase what possibilities would that open
spacex,removed,what is the endgame of your colonization plan do you think we will be able to explore beyond our solarsystem in a reasonable amount of time around years or will we mostly be stuck within our system unless some miraculous discovery happens what was the last thing you ate
spacex,removed,hi elon most of us were wondering how can we help you and spacex in the journey to mars
spacex,removed,will the first itsspaceship land on mars passengersless to prove that you are capable to safely land on the surface or will earth tests be enough
spacex,removed,sorry to piggyback here but raptor like raptor
spacex,removed,have you come designed a way for humans to survive for prolonged periods in space outside the magnetic zone of the earth without being bombarded with harmful radiation
spacex,removed,i use a wheelchair on earth but would die for the chance to walk on mars in lower gravity will the interplanetary spaceship be designed with accessibility in mind for people with physical disabilities
spacex,removed,hi elon red dragon appears to be a clone of the regular dragon capsule although it will of course be unmanned are you considering modifications to the first mars lander design to accommodate nasa instruments
spacex,removed,looks dangerous where do i sign up
spacex,removed,hello mr musk what would the protocol rules be like regarding incidents of violence and threats of terrorism for its thank you
spacex,removed,boy youve got a long day ahead of you
spacex,removed,mr musk off this question as new law student how do you suggest i help spacex get to mars
spacex,removed,embarrassed about iac yet
spacex,removed,after spacex has established its goal of becoming the union pacific railroad of mars do you have plans for creating companies to fill other needs for colonization what do you think will be the first company founded and incorporated on mars
spacex,removed,dont know why people downvoted you i like this question
spacex,removed,would you be interested in contracting xkcd for map of radiation in the solar system
spacex,removed,fewer lettersmore letters used in this commentbig fu falcon rocket used in this comment i giggled when i read this
spacex,removed,i am a freshman engineering student and i am thinking about majoring in aerospace but what sorts of engineers and scientists does the private space sector need besides aero engineers
spacex,removed,is it valid to think about using its for a small cometasteroid redirect mission beside the trips to mars what science mission would you like to the its to perform are there any of those being planned thanks
spacex,removed,freedom
spacex,removed,hi elon musk what stuff will the hog be transporting to mars to make life possible there for future human habitation
spacex,removed,hello elon do you have a favorite freezedried ice cream flavor just trying to ask the important questions
spacex,removed,hi elon what is the status of the human rated dragon why does it take so long to finish it and get it certified is there any part of this process that is particularly troublesome rooting for you and spacex from norway
spacex,removed,hi elon are you interested in testing the em drive it shows a lot of promise for a propellantfree intergalactic travel future
spacex,removed,hi mr musk inspirational motive for spacex is there a way to send the fuel up before the spacefarers and if so would you has spacex considered sending materials ahead of manned missions what would you send how much of it and most importantly of course can you put an earth flag on mars please literally a flag of a picture of earth thank you love your work peter
spacex,removed,will there be more information soon about the spacesuit you will be using
spacex,removed,hi elon early settlers on mars will be living in conditions that can be fairly compared to those of researchers in antarctica researchers rarely spend more than months at a time in antarctica before returning home and few would be keen to spend much longer than that there what do you think will convince the early settlers to stay for extended periods on mars instead of returning to earth after a year or two
spacex,removed,good day mr musk did you ever lose a thought on how a mars clolony would be governed would it be an extension of the united states or an entierly new country or state what would you prefer and what chances do you see in this kind of new beginning thank you for taking your time
spacex,removed,if a cargo mission on its was sent on a slower hohmann orbit whats the max amount of payload mass it could carry
spacex,removed,what a horrible question
spacex,removed,ive never seen so many downvotes in so little time
spacex,removed,why are you such a colossal douchebag
spacex,removed,when do you plan to start mining ice on mars for propellant production do you plan to use some sort of digging rovers for that
spacex,removed,elon thank you for taking the time to do this ama how much concern is the human aspect for the colonization of mars psychiatric evaluations people working together etc how long do you think resupplies would take to get out to the first colony group to reach mars thank you
spacex,removed,im a mechanical engineering student and i too would like to know this i want to work at space x eventually so picking up skills that will be essential to make these plans a success is something im extremely interested in
spacex,removed,hello elon what are your thoughts on self replicating robots exploring the universe while we watch them through our vr headsets
spacex,removed,my god i stayed up till for this ama and realized my questions are totally out of their league compared to everyone elses
spacex,removed,has spacex researched the httpemdrivecom or photon propulsion two experimental ideas that interest me
spacex,removed,hey elon im more of a recent fan of spacex but once i heard about it i was just super excited and the mission to mars made my childhood memories of being an astronaut explode anyway i looked into the pay and hours for spacex and i sorta thought it was a bit low for an aerospace engineer and that the hours were crazy long what benefits also come with working for spacex that balance out the huge work load
spacex,removed,and what is the scale
spacex,removed,did you mean deity
spacex,removed,hi elon have you ever considered attaching fully fueled tanker spaceships to a manned spaceship to increase its potential dv during outer planet missions could this enable parabolic solar orbits for faster transfer times to the outer planets
spacex,removed,hi elon in the presentation you showed developing the its booster after the its spacecraft the its tanker seems to be able to ssto and probably have enough fuel left to land am i thinking in the right direction if i think that thats your plan for testing edl capabilities of the spacecraft
spacex,removed,hi elon thanks for answering our questions i have heard that the constant direct radiation of space creates solar power opportunities do you have any plans to use spacex to expand solarcity into space to support a martian colony or otherwise
spacex,removed,hi elon i had read that russia plans to create a nuclear powered rocket that could travel to mars what are your thoughts on nuclear powered rockets and do you see a role for them in colonizing mars
spacex,removed,what economic model do you think would be the best for a mars colony capitalism socialism something star treky
spacex,removed,hi elon do you support civil rights for ai once the technological singularity occurs
spacex,removed,what first motivated you to help evolve us into an interplanetary species
spacex,removed,hi mr musk any books that you could recommend that would make me think along your lines you are an amazing critical thinker and i would love to emulate it thank you
spacex,removed,to what extent do you expect to collaborate with nasa in regards to the its
spacex,removed,how many questions do you have i am getting tired of upvoting all of them
spacex,removed,greetings mr elon musk solidworks expert from the uk on solidworks subreddit explains rudeish username question whats your view on the use of nuclear reactors on mars possibly sans uraniumthorium on the way there and possibly some insight into the legal political and practical issues would be great too i cannot help thinking that such devices would be essential for initial development purposes would love to hear your views on this subject matter especially if you think i am disastrously wrong and precisely why i am so
spacex,removed,is spacex going to develop a mars rover for astronauts to traverse the surface if so how much of it will be based on what youve donelearned at tesla
spacex,removed,the mct system that youre proposing will see the craft equipped with the machinery to produce methane and oxygen as fuel do you intend to bring the machinery required to turn feedstock methane into plastics on the first few craft or later when the colony has more colonialists
spacex,removed,development for its to be a success thank you i believe its carbon nanotubes
spacex,removed,for as long as i can remembersince reading frank herberts dune ive dreamed of how i could help to make the human species an interstellar species how can i go to mars
spacex,removed,i would love to goto the moon
spacex,removed,what procedures can be taken to prevent lox ice
spacex,removed,what are the ways a person could get a trip to mars are only those with high wealth and high education being sent how soon do you plan on sending the second ship or will you be using the same ship by going to and from earth
spacex,removed,what is your daily tesla you drive to work
spacex,removed,can you send me to mars please
spacex,removed,im curious to know how companies you chair impact space x i imagine solar city would probably be the most helpful as solar panels are needed on the craft and the colony
spacex,removed,thanks for the ama elon do you think moving to other planets is a human want or do you think it has transcended to being a need because of how poorly were treating our planet currently
spacex,removed,curious what is its

spacex,removed,mr musk in light of the recent wikileaks dumps in which there is a correspondence between former apollo astronaut edgar d mitchell and john podesta discussing disclosure of zero point energy and the existence of benevolent extra terrestrial intelligence from a contiguous universe i must ask why isnt spacex pursuing zpe technology over rocketry here are a few links to the httpswwwgooglecomtbmptstbmptsqnassimharamein and httpharameinresonanceisresearch done by nassim haramein and the resonance project foundation if spacex is truly serious about taking a quantum leap into the next paradigm of human civilization by harnessing zero point energy and creating interplanetary and intergalactic colonies i would implore you all to take a look into their work
spacex,removed,a hitchikers guide to the galaxy reference
spacex,removed,do you think we can find unknown metals on mars that cant be found on earth

spacex,removed,have you tried duct tape
spacex,removed,you named the ship heart of gold id give you reddit gold just for that if i wasnt a starving artist replying to a multimillionaire
spacex,removed,hi elon musk im a student in the middle of my o level examinations and in the future i want to become an aerospace engineer im a really big fan of your work especially spacex and tesla motors i really want to ask you what advice do you have for an aspiring aerospace engineer if we do colonize mars wouldnt the fuel required for constant trips back and forth become a problem what alternative energy sources might be used whats next after you make it to mars
spacex,removed,how much faith do you have in our ability to mitigate the impending environmental issues is your drive to get to mars motivated by the feeling that we are otherwise doomed or just hedging our bets
spacex,removed,what a great pr response
spacex,removed,in addition but not really necessary at the moment any technology yall considering for defense not a conspiracy theory but you never know if the russiansaliens will try and stake claim to americas mars colony any ideas on how fiberoptics is going to be utilized out there beyond the essential telecommunication needs you should bury some along perimeter and along all connecting roads and facilities to give you live monitoring of the asset not a sales pitch

spacex,removed,ive been hoping he uses so much for subtlety at some point how can that one get left on the table
spacex,removed,oh deity someone is going to name it the uranus colonial transporter
spacex,removed,that or like the culture series with no number and a silly name ie mct a ship with a view launching on slv super lift vehicle transient atmospheric phenomenon
spacex,removed,thats a very kerbal approach and i love it getting back is hard so start the framework of a colony instead
spacex,removed,the culture series has such great names conveying lots of subtext good names armchair traveller space monster ultimate ship the second he referred to that one in at tweet already what is the answer and why now look what youve made me do not so good names screw loose dramatic exit funny it worked last time
spacex,removed,ssss solar system spaceship ssss could of course be shortened to ss quaratics
spacex,removed,oh hang on i think i have some in my garage brb

spacex,removed,nope it just means you are a girl you need too have some skill needed on tye space industry to be a space engineer also you need too keep a emotional free thinking when building space stuff
spacex,removed,the guys at arianespace should get a few copies of kerbal space program to simulate that one a few times p cuz thats totally the kerbal solution

spacex,removed,rreallifedoodles needs this
spacex,removed,this is a great post it examines a number of possible scenarios regarding the outline of mct it misses one thing though the business logic what do you mean he addressed this it gets better than that with full reusability of the upper stage even a full bfrmct launch despite its huge mass is going to be significantly cheaper to launch than a current falcon launch the reason is that the falcon upper stage costs somewhere around million dollars while even of bfrmct propellant is going to cost much less than that only around million dollars on the contrary the business logic of your post is far more questionable lets go pointbypoint falcon may be fantastic vehicles but theres zero reason to keep it around once youve demonstrated something cheaper sunk cost fallacy capital sure is expensive which is why you want to amortize the expensive rockets and launch sites over as many launches as possible satellites included developing a fairing is childs play compared to this theyd only need a few fairings with full reuse remember that everything spacex does is with future application to the mars vehicle in mind fairing reuse included if they have an oven big enough to make the bfr interstage they can cure a fairing the payload adapter is similarly small potatoes from an rd perspective theyll do what theyve done before build on their previous experience with a smaller launcher the falcon is just a scaled up falcon using heritage engines structures avionics with a few improvements and bfr will be the same the fueler is the generic second stage as you and i have discussed the name really last i checked changing names is cheap and carries very little mass penalty youre putting waaay too much stock in what so far amounts to a working title basically what youre suggesting is that spacex should go of the way there and avoid doing the last of the rd work capital cost and instead keep around an entirely separate vehicle and set of processes and launch sites it makes no sense as ive said before its like airlines passing up the revenue from hauling anything under their because they cant be bothered to add a lower door

spacex,removed,just annoys me that we are more interested in blowing up this rock than landing on another it begs the question if we as a species even deserve another planet when we clearly cannot be trusted with the one we have

spacex,removed,why is this tweet being downvoted
spacex,removed,i want a pool
spacex,removed,atleast elonsenpai noticed you
spacex,removed,i can see the scenario you describe happening with orbital space tourism of course i cant leave it there i just cant see spacex avoiding an incredible liability exposure it there is a an incident or accident that leads to serious injury or loss of life either to or from the habitat or during the stay at the habitat i know there will be ironclad contracts and releases but consider there is a catastrophic loss of atmosphere inside the habitiat three of the six inhabitants die of asphixiand and the corpese will succumb to the horrible optics of decompression the other three make it inside the docked dragon but the only survives to land on earth of course all of this is captured in video and dolby surrond sound audio that very day the space tourism company and the habitat company that contracted with spacex to provide transportation declaresbankruptcy and simultaneously file lawsuits against spacex alleging the dragon damaged the habitat docking ring that led to the decompression the families of the dead and the survivor will file suits establishing the venue in east texas the best court for big money liability injury suits against large corporations they will file suit against spacex because spacex has the deep pockets the videos of excrutiating deathand the desecration of the bodies from the decompression will swamp the internet sealed or not someone will leak them the survivor will hit every media site reliving the horror with exquisitely timed cuts to the horrible videos spacex will be accused of callous deliberate neglect that led to these deaths just to save the money it would take to have had backup plans in space spacex will lose tens of millions and millions of dollars maybe more depending on punitive damages the spacex reputation will never recover and in congress and the competition the sharks will circle
spacex,removed,ft really ft
spacex,removed,ಠಠ
spacex,removed,wow ocisly is a grower
spacex,removed,wonder if someone over at space x has taken notice of the internet based whining about the usa usa chants you know all the maybe its just me but i find the usa chanting to be disquieting really this should be considered an achievement for all mankind such jingoistic nationalism zzzzzzzzz posts were getting after every sucessful landing now old glory seems to be featured more prominently here than on any other patches
spacex,removed,what is one metric assload in ibf
spacex,removed,hes elon disguised dont tell anyone p
spacex,removed,the tweet had only fs imposter s

spacex,removed,true that its a hard life man
spacex,removed,they mustve finally listened to the internets super useful advice they should just like make the boat bigger
spacex,removed,congrats you won the karma race
spacex,removed,ear phones
spacex,removed,if i am open to maybe being experimented on would you guys shoot me into space
spacex,removed,ok so what im not wrong wtf is up with people on this sub being contrarian dicks i thought we were here to talk about cool spacex stuff whatever
spacex,removed,its photoshop of vector editors not much more to say it works dont think too long about getting software just steal itbecause trial versions suck arse if you liked it buy it
spacex,removed,okso im right then
spacex,removed,the best kind of correct
spacex,removed,i still maintain my quest for congenital optimist

spacex,removed,well thats a badass modern version of a viking funeral i guess
spacex,removed,may be some of it is still standing
spacex,removed,good guy elon with repro steps and a video thats a quality jira ticket right there
spacex,removed,oh yeah other mct possibilities big sexy beast i said ive got a big stick passing by and thought id drop in outstanding contribution to the historical process and for future landings you call this clean size isnt everything
spacex,removed,so much for subtlety that is the perfect name for the first bfr
spacex,removed,core dump thanks for the chuckle
spacex,removed,rocket science its not exactly brain surgery is it
spacex,removed,i heard their rocket blew up with a facebook sattelite or so they finally landed a rocket after crashing it times this is called shit storming

spacex,removed,what you mean humans work at space x holy shit i thought elin musk was a martian wanting to get home all along
spacex,removed,if by prosperous you mean in debt then yes
spacex,removed,giants like the guys who built saturn v not like the guys who ordered others to invade iraq and afghanistan

spacex,removed,people dying will not get us there sooner you idiot
spacex,removed,should i be worried about that capitalism in space
spacex,removed,escobar probably wouldve beat us to it and have developed martian coke by the time we arrive
spacex,removed,keep the captain out of this one there is a twenty to fifty per cent chance that the problem here was the same as too anxious to rtf a fix was dictated without due consideration of other causes by due is meant a rigorous regime of copv testing which they are going to have to do if there are any space journalists who bother browsing the peanut gallery an idiotbastard question would be were the data streams actually on at the anomaly event
spacex,removed,richard garriott for president
spacex,removed,stick with the culture call the class a general system vehicle maybe an lsv for the first iteration

spacex,removed,nature is indeed very powerfulpractically nothing else is more powerful except for an apache helicopter an apache helicopter has machine guns and missiles it is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry an absolute death machine
spacex,removed,elon musk is basically playing kerbal space program in real life someday im sure lithrobraked into mars will get added to the list
spacex,removed,doug messier has definitely got a thing for griefing spacex wonder whos cheques hes cashing
spacex,removed,i can already see the attack ad democrats weak on nature
spacex,removed,honestly this reminds me of that contact movie scene when that nutjob boicotts the rocket and makes it explode could it be
spacex,removed,naaaaa dont listen to it youll be perfectly dressed im a space pirate and need you to do you ill help you with photos if you like
spacex,removed,there never had problems with this before why would they now is not like the climate is changing or anything
spacex,removed,good tips but note that elon is not godking of mars hes the elon so it was prophesied by wernher von braun himself so it shall be see httpimgurcomayhvdh
spacex,removed,crumbs who knew there was a saturn v as well as an atlas v at thats one crowded launch pad yes i know its a typo and they meant atlas v i couldnt help myself
spacex,removed,keep asking how long and see if you ever get an insightful answer or you know try a different tactic
spacex,removed,the hype is real
spacex,removed,hype train now leaving the station this is gonna be great
spacex,removed,thanks urocketroad i mean elon your secret is safe with us
spacex,removed,did elon forget to before launch what a noob mistake
spacex,removed,his plan for health is simple he will weigh less on mars
spacex,removed,this looks amazing reminds me of hbos
spacex,removed,nukedog
spacex,removed,so like travelling to thailand far that sucks theres going to be so many connecting flights
spacex,removed,not too many people use light seconds in normal conversation elon is on another level
spacex,removed,meaningful could mean not hundreds no one can know what goes on in elons head
spacex,removed,well in the end the ruskies killed only at least four astronauts until now and are the only ones who had launch aborts that saved people theres a lot of secrecy and unknowns from the old soviet days
spacex,removed,their first stage had engines how kerbal is that
spacex,removed,is ycombinator trying to be mainstream again i mean thats a nice design and all but embedding content aint gonna do it when the remaining userbase keeps shrinking
spacex,removed,his weight is probably still below average for an american
spacex,removed,you were testing my lack of trust in reddit on this one i know its far away but that was a nice visualization thanks
spacex,removed,ugh
spacex,removed,amazon still isnt making a profit
spacex,removed,now im depressed
spacex,removed,space nerds are fucking delusional worshiping a symbolic notion of progress and i dont understand why im the only guy on reddit who realizes this putting humans on mars is an insanely stupid waste of resources by any reasonable evaluation there is no reason to expect it to happen within the time frame where we can make reasonable predictions about the future at all
spacex,removed,why so ambitious
spacex,removed,i tried on mobile
spacex,removed,he was probably convinced after watching the martian
spacex,removed,years confirmed
spacex,removed,i volunteer as tribute
spacex,removed,then take a motor home geezus get your shit together
spacex,removed,i have the potential to not shitpost yet here i am musk has no concept of reality
spacex,removed,hes not using random numbers when he says hell give most of his wealth to charity
spacex,removed,yes
spacex,removed,seriously someone explain to me how this is magically going to happen in years even if you charitably assume itd be no more expensive than the apollo program which is already kind of nuts and i would think lowballing by many times over that cost like more than times as much as elon musks entire personal fortune
spacex,removed,solid excerpts and point my question is how do i get that sense of urgency about anything
spacex,removed,lol yeah that shotwell is such a joker elon too what would they know about how long it will take its not like they can decide when to return to flight
spacex,removed,so years so basically right in line with nasa planning of course theyre going to go together
spacex,removed,omfg hes gone and done it the tony stark hairstyle
spacex,removed,well maybe not the airport cavity search part i dont need to see that
spacex,removed,we were talking about space x go grind your axe elsewhere
spacex,removed,as example
spacex,removed,how the hell does he have enough time for both spacex and tesla
spacex,removed,its a one way trip no ever coming back the likelihood of survival is very low
spacex,removed,you should tell elon
spacex,removed,if you want to do a better comparison calculation then feel free id prefer you stopped shitposting
spacex,removed,he has a tour sorted
spacex,removed,he does have a tour there are also itar waivers
spacex,removed,guys ill do it just sign the money over real quick
spacex,removed,hilarious cool names
spacex,removed,what
spacex,removed,theyll have to science the shit out of that one
spacex,removed,can someone inform me on spacex drug testing policy i am looking into a technician position is it just a urine test or do they go deeper
spacex,removed,so it has and established record of of years and of a few years scientific terms mean time between confirmed kills mean time between brown pants landings

spacex,removed,have
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,man i hope its not government employees
spacex,removed,he said he would retire on mars which is awesome because i assume he will say my work is done here on earth then blast off to mars very tony stark
spacex,removed,i volunteer as tribute
spacex,removed,i highly doubt a public company like nasa would allow its public employees on the first manned mission to mars ever especially coming from a private company probably insurance and prwise however spacex employees would be the best bet they can start training retired marines right now depart is only in train of your top science people and voilà first group is set
spacex,removed,ill be can i go
spacex,removed,god how fucking would would it be to stand or float next to the mct in orbit around mars
spacex,removed,how will they get enough fuel to return the astronaut after he reaches mars

spacex,removed,its something
spacex,removed,you think mark watney gets out of there alive if hes a pilot no way dude send more botanists
spacex,removed,are you suggesting that they burn him alive to collect his ashes
spacex,removed,well sending a dentist from michigan would be the obvious choice maybe one with experience at space camp
spacex,removed,lmao good to see he has high hopes for mars
spacex,removed,i volunteer
spacex,removed,hello peter whats happening ummm im gonna need you to go ahead and go to mars tomorrow
spacex,removed,my bet is that itll a a team composed solely of redditors subscribed to rspacex
spacex,removed,this is perfect
spacex,removed,might slip to
spacex,removed,eiríkr hinn rauði
spacex,removed,in ksp pilots are next to useless imo much easier to send an engineer and a scientist and one of those sas modules i think with modern spacecraft and bear in mind we havent put people in a spacecraft more modern than the space shuttle which couldnt even autoland until many years into its career that paradigm will prove rather accurate

spacex,removed,did you remember tho
spacex,removed,theyre only a few miles from the mexican border just extend that wall a bit farther
spacex,removed,do you realize the sources required request was added after the post that was hidden
spacex,removed,i bet jake from state farm would give you a quote hed probably be wearing khakis too
spacex,removed,you missed the word that in my post i simply said that rockets post existed before the sources required tag so it was legal when posted i like the sources required and i think you guys are doing a good job im just not sure hiding the post in question was the right call
spacex,removed,its possible to imagine incorrect forces being transmitted to the exact junction of the two tanks in fact the support will be designed to rest exactly where the two tanks are joined the reason is that the walls of are milled down to reduce dry mass but they leave the full metal thickness where welds are made such as the vertical tank seam and where the hemispherical bulkhead between the top lox tank and the bottom tank is welded the combination of greater metal thickness and the internal bulkhead make this the only place where you would want to put pressure on the walls of it would seem to be roughly impossible for this support to be pressing on the incorrect location rocket tanks do not get made the wrong length by half a meter or more without someone noticing
spacex,removed,or the rest of your life or perhaps both at once
spacex,removed,looks like space x shouldnt do a static fire two days before launch both times they did a falcon died this is a correlation so obviously it must always hold true
spacex,removed,i dont know why this thread even exists then as neither spacex nor anyone else involved in the investigation has released any more information it is not possible to quote a source
spacex,removed,this is a speculation thread in all but name putting a sources required flare on it doesnt really change that in my opinion rockets analysis pretty much the best post in this thread he used the only real source available the explosion and extrapolated his analysis from that i think the posts removal was a bit heavy handed and i dont think this thread is suitable for sources required flare
spacex,removed,damn spacex you dun fucked this one up i love you guys a lot but you need to pull it together
spacex,removed,the main points of his claims were not sourced thats because when i wrote and edited the comment the thread was not flaired sourcesonly yet i only discovered that flair hour after the fact btw the picture link i provided to the umbilicals is technically a source it pointed out a factual error in the op and i backed it up with a primary source a link to spacexs website adding a youtube video every paragraph or two does not count you need to back up all primary claims btw the list of facts were based on video analysis i performed ie im and the video is the primary source fwiiw heres the source for my fuelair mixture scenario the valve is near the tank common bulkhead which might have been the source of fuelair mixture if you watch that video at the timestamp i provide in the link youll see the second stage briefly but vigorously venting to the right shortly after the static fire has finished that might be a nitrogen purge of fuel lines done shortly after the static fire was finished or it could be venting of the second stage tank from flight pressure to regular pressure if that vent emits anomalously high amounts of for example due to a faulty fuel level sensor then that would be in a position to spray out to around the common bulkhead alternatively it could also be a lox vent although its position is weird the lox vent is visible in the top left corner of the lox tank it makes little sense to put a lox vent to the bottom of the lox tank or maybe its some third variant i did not think of
spacex,removed,i suppose this single tower smoked but not scorched

spacex,removed,theres no weekend on mars robots dont need them
spacex,removed,indeed it is a simple calculation which you clearly havent done because if you had you wouldnt still be posting condescending bullshit electrolyzing tons of water to produce tons of oxygen would require a total of of energy this commercial steam turbine which is light enough to fit onto an its along with a reactor to generate the steam it runs on could produce that much energy in three days applause look here im use only yours digits without any checking energy j joules time seconds power is energy time joules per second or watts ba water electrolysis optimally take place at volts strictly speaking its slightly less but this not interesting for raw calculations this is means that required current should be amperes mega amperes ps excuse my curiosity but i would like to clarify where and how many years have you taught sciences

spacex,removed,is still damaged from the explosion when will spacex be able to use it again
spacex,removed,well if spacex does become the biggest isp perhaps they would deny service to amazon and make jeff bezos and blue origin go bankrupt
spacex,removed,where did the date of february come from
spacex,removed,wait what million dollar deals that occur a dozen times a year are up for negotiation what is this like some kind of bizarre
spacex,removed,its pretty funny since it comes from the guy that gets yearly subsidies and million per flight from the french government when confronted about the actions to take to face the competition spacex ula etc he couldnt do anything but embarrass himself this guy is a scam
spacex,removed,im calling you a liar and a revisionist actually youre moving goalposts too first you say falcon was designed for launches from the beginning verifiably false now you say theyre being engineering for launches i love me some moving goalposts
spacex,removed,you seem to have some serious issues your hate for spacex is pretty strong hell your hate for iterative design is mind boggling spacex is in no danger at all if you want to see a company in danger go back to just before that first nasa contract in
spacex,removed,perhaps somewhat offtopic but i for one am glad to see the return of the pbdes steelyeyed stare
spacex,removed,im always looking for him to hide the word sex in his names anyone who does it twice is probably going to do it a third time
spacex,removed,this seems unnecessarily harsh this coming from you is hilarious one does not need to look all that far back in your post history to find harsher statements about spacex in a spacex subreddit no less i dont say this to dissuade you of speaking your mind but merely to point out the hypocrisy of your outrage of harsh words just about everything you said in your first paragraph about the poster you replied too can be applied to yourself just in regards to spacex
spacex,removed,so its just total speculation then got it
spacex,removed,it just a week but i feel like many weeks
spacex,removed,and summer all year round at the launch site while every other european is stuck with bitter cold winters
spacex,removed,philosophical question if trump was willing to provide through nasa a fixed price contract for its development and order five mars flights at each would elon agree if the condition was that the its was named after him i am thinking trump exploration system or similar history provides some support with cape canaveral being renamed as cape kennedy with a later name reversion its itself is not a much loved name and seems to have been a last minute change to avoid the unfortunate associations of the mars colonial transport this is not a political question as such and does not represent my view on the current potus it is more about how much commercialism is a natural part of commercial space
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,you can tell because of the way it is
spacex,removed,should be the top comment
spacex,removed,sniper
spacex,removed,according to the timeline sure according to realistic estimates not so much
spacex,removed,according to the timeline sure according to realistic estimates not so much
spacex,removed,holy smokes i didnt know that south africa was on mars
spacex,removed,just think of all the science points spacex will get from these missions
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,spacex is basically me when i play kerbal space program
spacex,removed,just leave some fuel in the tanks detect earthquake lift off land once quake subsides problem solved i cannot see any way that could go wrong
spacex,removed,just to troll falcons
spacex,removed,i chose fucking
spacex,removed,oh sick then this is gonna turn out awesome
spacex,removed,i hope they make the monument team rocket hq in pokemon go
spacex,removed,i think the port crane should have a good name like the ship of course i still love you i propose hang on here we go others
spacex,removed,now that we want to see
spacex,removed,a heatsink make the grid fins be the heatsink
spacex,removed,you deserve the snidley whiplash award for outstanding evil idea of the year
spacex,removed,ha
spacex,removed,they could have saved themselves a lot of work and just landed it there
spacex,removed,do you reckon they made the interns do that q what did you do on your internship make coffee and do the photocopying a nah i washed rockets
spacex,removed,and it doubles as a pingpong paddle for the moon
spacex,removed,so just like the millennium falcon then sweet
spacex,removed,furmans
spacex,removed,you are not each and every time
spacex,removed,nope me too every time
spacex,removed,you are not alone i too always do a double take
spacex,removed,so whats your point that rocket science is hard hahah
spacex,removed,source your flair
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,too soon
spacex,removed,hot takes
spacex,removed,engines looks to be ok looks like they have made smart reuse before ula s
spacex,removed,sorry but after i saw that post
spacex,removed,its still going that wasnt a loop
spacex,removed,second theory
spacex,removed,i hope theyll not attempt to patent landing pads on land as well
spacex,removed,uunitconversionbot have found such values ms ms is kmh or mph
spacex,removed,what is the best place to see the launch from my friends and i are heading down to canaveral from chattanooga early tomorrow morning and we were going to watch from port canaveral which is almost miles away from the launch site is there anyway we could get closer
spacex,removed,oh im sorry thanks though
spacex,removed,so thats where they new radiohead cover art comes from
spacex,removed,totally ripped from hes doing it with other stuff too fuckwads like this will cause some of the more generous with info members to stfu or shut down cooperation between nsf and the companies it doesnt matter if you like or not this shit is not cool
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,so months httpwhenwillfalconheavylaunchcom
spacex,removed,see xkcd from earlier this week the barge will be having some minor renovations done
spacex,removed,what is the upgraded falcon hes talking about i thought all falcons were ft
spacex,removed,marchapril wed have cities on mars by then
spacex,removed,emphasize in the end of years yeeeea note elon time may push it back to early but it still good
spacex,removed,aww well thats disappointing
spacex,removed,or version block alpha
spacex,removed,maybe it has to do with deploying the methane raptor engine on the second stage that would be a pleasant surprise if true
spacex,removed,future fake news space exploration technologies innovator of spaceflight reuse changes course and is going back to expendable flights
spacex,removed,musk time multiplier confirmed he says months months ago and now its months away ie months from his initial statement
spacex,removed,his consistency and creativity in naming is why i firmly believe he will start with two simultaneous mars outposts named mars base alpha and moon unit zappa
spacex,removed,of elon time
spacex,removed,the smithsonian claimed it invented reusable rockets and filed for the patent
spacex,removed,alright he has got to be fucking with us there is no way he isnt aware of how this naming scheme looks
spacex,removed,lewd jokes aside falcon just isnt the same without the fins or legs itll be a weirdly sombre launch i think
spacex,removed,but anyway ill tell you if i see a core here in italy
spacex,removed,do you think theyll make a diameter raptor based methalox rocket
spacex,removed,will this be the first legless since the introduction of the i thought they all had legs but am not sure they did introduce the grid fins later
spacex,removed,i am excited to see the truly stretch its legs must be one hell of a payload to warrant a fully expendable flight
spacex,removed,thats exactly why itll make an interesting bet i cant wait i hope i lose
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,so youre saying they start with two legs then add one if by land and two if by sea
spacex,removed,just throwing this out there grid fin legs
spacex,removed,can we at least pour one out for when it launches so sad
spacex,removed,that landing leg picture was finally the picture to impress on me the size of what spacex are landing here i spent a good minutes in shock and awe haha
spacex,removed,if httpwwwpaulrevereheritagecomoneifbylandtwoifbyseahtml designed rockets
spacex,removed,but what if the brakes had enough control to be able to adjust to any turning
spacex,removed,does that mean falcon heavy will not fly this year
spacex,removed,please avoid using unusual acronyms like cpm it generates confusion with little benefit acronyms seriously suck
spacex,removed,so youre saying theres a chance
spacex,removed,months away
spacex,removed,dummy payload i cant guess how many other folks are too but im still on team schoolbus for this a spectacular humanrecognizablescale mass simulator
spacex,removed,the headline would look like this spacex remains tightlipped about the possible failure of one of its rockets as it disappears over the pacific update launch failure wreakage of the rocket has washed up on the shores on a side note spacex has confirmed the successful launch of echostar
spacex,removed,haha good one
spacex,removed,they clearly already have one how else do you think they start the engines
spacex,removed,theres no way well get this but it would be so cool
spacex,removed,if ksp has taught me anything four legs good three legs bad with three legs the tipping point is significantly closer to vertical than four sure it doesnt add any redundancy of a leg fails but it would too easier on legs
spacex,removed,cnn catastrophe at spacex as falcon misses drone ship by miles is this the end of elon musk
spacex,removed,im pretty sure theres a paul revere joke to be had in there
spacex,removed,for milk you can do condensed milk for eggs i might just dump some money into a chicken coop
spacex,removed,is fairings really that expensive why would you need to reuse them
spacex,removed,a manned mission first of all dont be sexist we use crewed now second we were talking about red dragon not its its will be crewed although not the first flights red dragon cant sustain a crew for more than a few days i believe certainly not several months
spacex,removed,arstechnica is click bait popscience
spacex,removed,nice im jealous i was just in long beach two months ago but probably wont be back for another year or two
spacex,removed,i thought it was the falcon in all seriousness the names are ridiculous now
spacex,removed,that is amazing thank you for making my day better rspacex
spacex,removed,holy moly you sound so jaded
spacex,removed,quitter
spacex,removed,why do you think you are qualified to work at spacex i play kerbal space program that counts right
spacex,removed,have about a thousand upvotes
spacex,removed,habitat for humanity is colonizing space
spacex,removed,when youre not even qualified to work on a bottle rocket thats tough breaks man
spacex,removed,this is in fact my plan ditto although mine is a threephase plan plan a the direct route its still inprogress im trying to be an astronaut the traditional way engineer pilot astronaut while at the same time plan b saving the vast majority of my income which means ill be httpswwwredditcomrfinancialindependence within the next years and probably be able to buy a ticket if that cant happen plan c once i am fi ill quit and start my own evil corporation john smith industries of course and take over the world then ill just buy the whole rocket
spacex,removed,does firing roman candles from ones butt count as experience

spacex,removed,tldr
spacex,removed,what exactly does rtls stand for is this more complexmore difficult to achieve than a landing on the drone ship

spacex,removed,now youre arguing some hype do you not notice you are desperately still comparing solar energy output to nuclear this cannot be called a conversation lol you are just blindly repeating irrelevant misinformation and im just constantly pointing out it is not what i am discussing at all its bizarre you obviously cannot or refuse to understandacknowledge this serious question what is the stimulant drugs you are taking i noticed your profile activity on another sub stims its probably affecting comprehension

spacex,removed,elon damnit gwynne why did you reveal we were sending the raptors to texas gwynne relax i only said it was one not all
spacex,removed,just imagine this glorious opening the curtain is lifted and here is the raptor engine then the raptor is lifted and out comes elon musk
spacex,removed,the lonestar state is shooting for the stars
spacex,removed,the raptor is the newest employee at spacex and they are just going to fire it right away before its first paycheck
spacex,removed,further proof musk is an alien helping us join the rest of the civilized universe
spacex,removed,hmmmm launch threads are a little like an echo chamber and yes this comment is only legal inside a launch thread echoechoecho
spacex,removed,but we all saw the flame in the martian
spacex,removed,yeah i know but are there any videos of burning
spacex,removed,watney is toast
spacex,removed,its not more complicated than landing an orbital booster vertically on a in the middle of the ocean thats my point

spacex,removed,those thrust diamonds gave me a nerd boner
spacex,removed,i would be tempted to join a physics cult if it existed
spacex,removed,so tell us are you elon
spacex,removed,depends on the cocaine
spacex,removed,follow elon he will lead us to the launch pad we will ascend to the heavens to live in peace and harmony in the promised land in the sky
spacex,removed,its fun to keep implying it though
spacex,removed,bonus points if they place a model of alderaan in the path of the exhaust prior to lighting it up

spacex,removed,dick

spacex,removed,or spacex is going full uber
spacex,removed,the faa is a lot of bark but no bite and is really only interested in making sure the right government agencies get their fees paid than anything to do with safety if spacex is making an announcement of a launch date then its because the faa is no longer a concern for them luckily we have a president coming in that likes elon a lot more than the corrupt bureaucratic mess that is the faa
spacex,removed,i do believe all the comments underneath are therefore defined as jokes including this one dammit here you go joke

spacex,removed,what happens to the second stage after deploying the payload do they do a deorbit burn so it reenters or does it become more space debris related do spacex launches introduce more space debris or do all the parts that can come off the spacecraft come off before orbit thanks

spacex,removed,i went to mcdonalds today and got a filetofish combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side i was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audiobook when i glanced up and saw the mcdonalds worker i ordered outside having a cigarette she waved at me and i nodded and had to wait minutes before she went back inside and i could eat in comfort again i dont think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the mcdonalds restaurant or drive through but that is another story i went to mcdonalds for dinner tonight and got a mcchicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side as i was driving to the second window the same girl was still working she was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked why dont you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot where it is cold that really bothered me for many reasons first of all i dont want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee secondly she should not try to tell me how i should live my life i do not want to eat inside because i find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy overall i think it was very unprofessional to bring this up i should have a clean slate with each drive through visit not have to get the third degree because i committed some sort of faux pas which i dont think i did because i often see people eating in fast food parking lots how does she know i am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush how do you feel about eating in your vehicle in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant versus eating inside the restaurant

spacex,removed,those poor bushes are in for a whooooole world of hurt
spacex,removed,thats to million in tests in just fuel la times says elon is literally burning cash with all of his companies s
spacex,removed,it is p
spacex,removed,it is then all joking asside the falcon heavy is getting close but with normal delays of a new launch vehicle it is likely to go into
spacex,removed,ill bet gold
spacex,removed,you are a gentleman and a scholar
spacex,removed,wheel of cheese with a gopro strapped to it past mars i hope
spacex,removed,everytime i see this guys thumbnail picture i instantly think its angryvideogamenerd
spacex,removed,cool that is the same day i start my aerospace course
spacex,removed,relax its only months awaytm
spacex,removed,what could spacex provide as their own payload it would be funny if it was a tesla
spacex,removed,and yet it will still cost the tax payer at least billion euros i think ariane is as doomed as ula their whole business model is based on having a nice wee cartel that over charges for everything
spacex,removed,if you understand whats being said thats the important part the confusing bit is all the fancy words
spacex,removed,xd thanks
spacex,removed,i guess as long as there wont be any major incidents they will fly read dragon in prematurely and slam that thing into the red dirt pretty hard hey look we can slam things into mars just as good as esa can
spacex,removed,hopefully we will not have more slips so say we all
spacex,removed,cheese is a pretty good idea though the biggest moon replica made out of cheese that can fit into the faring d look the moon is made of cheese
spacex,removed,i am very skeptical we will see it fly in
spacex,removed,very doubtful the way it has been going
spacex,removed,my guess is because this sub is heavily populated by fans of cool space hardware rather than space accountants sums it up
spacex,removed,a model
spacex,removed,only the cheese needs to survive
spacex,removed,maybe they could launch a scale model on the tip of a used to get aerodynamic data
spacex,removed,just put a raptor on it who wouldnt love to see that
spacex,removed,just for a second
spacex,removed,photoshopped
spacex,removed,i am not on facebook anymore but this post about the reddit mods and other members and their elitist behavior makes me want to reactivate my old account bill carton i tip my hat to you and hope the patch actually looks like a high resolution version of what you have posted have your sources dried up on this one they are going to cry about that one for a while
spacex,removed,a vertical takeoff and landing vtol aircraft is one that can hover take off and land vertically the first stage has too much thrust to be able to hover
spacex,removed,had me fooled
spacex,removed,so you can drop your kids off at moon school and still make it to work on time
spacex,removed,they disassemble in rapid orderly fashion
spacex,removed,we just have to admit that their system is better for changes like this the left do love their dictators
spacex,removed,ditto
spacex,removed,elon its too big it wont fit
spacex,removed,is there no area within rspacex in which to discuss the legitimacy of censorship does it not seem a bit unethical to censor posts discussing censorship
spacex,removed,yeah really we should just address meta issues in the ask anything this doesnt belong in this thread at all
spacex,removed,not necessarily i used mod mail to ask about my deleted comments from the ask anything thread and only got an extra downvote and the following in response do you do anything other than criticise people the original comment was me saying they shouldnt call the thread ask anything if they wont allow subreddit related questions
spacex,removed,this
spacex,removed,i read the thread at the time and am fairly certain i know why they removed it i dont think this is why though speculating or saying why is just going to get your post removed though especially if youre right
spacex,removed,wink
spacex,removed,the large bottles on the trailer contain compressed nitrogen to power the rcs thrusters during the journey
spacex,removed,since even discussion of the secretive censorship we witnessed today is censored where are we allowed to discuss this censorship do we need to start a separate subreddit to be able to discuss this subreddit without being censored
spacex,removed,better be careful that last line is likely to get your comment censored
spacex,removed,comcast anyone
spacex,removed,man zubrin really needs to let go of that mess on his head
spacex,removed,care to explain mods
spacex,removed,so you see i went to burning men festival and there was all this shit how does he cope with all the shit

spacex,removed,pussy
spacex,removed,archived where can i find that
spacex,removed,the sub runs semiregular metathreads that ask for input on rules though you are free to now if youd like but the mods do constantly listen to feedback in the past month or so there have been a good number of too strict complaints and efforts to loosen things up without hurting quality are happening given the explicit invitation i hope the mods wont censor this comment as well from where i stand any efforts to loosen things up have not been evident not only were hundreds of ontopic highquality comments deleted today with noexplanation but any attempt to even discuss the censorship amongst ourselves was deleted this sub is beginning to feel like the north korean internet
spacex,removed,were is the post with the talk of frozen crystals
spacex,removed,there was a deleted thread of elon talking to the nro where he said the current leading theory was this we are close to figuring it out it might have been formation of solid oxygen in the carbon overwrap of one of the bottles in the upper stage tanks if it was liquid it would have been squeezed out but under pressure it could have ignited with the carbon this is the leading theory right now but it is subject to confirmation
spacex,removed,it wasnt security related it was just more heavyhanded removal
spacex,removed,all of it was archived but the archive posts are banned here mods deleted them
spacex,removed,obligatory futurama reference
spacex,removed,make me sad for the sub im not here to read approved by spacex pr news im here to read redditors sharing with others redditors im sad today
spacex,removed,negative karma for generations to come
spacex,removed,no it shouldnt be i dont want to read you whine
spacex,removed,my question would be can you take me to space please pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease pretty pleeeeeeeeeeeeease
spacex,removed,am i reading wired or motherboard s
spacex,removed,he joked about crowdfunding as a source of capital for making mars happen but do you guys think thats a legitimate option assuming they set up their own donation portal or something similar
spacex,removed,it is another to have enough people actually having decided to spend their fortunes to go live on a desolate barren empty planet that offers significantly worse living conditions than anywhere on this world the way things are going by the time spacex is flying to mars it will over significantly better living conditions than most places on earth well be lucky if clinton hasnt triggered wwiii by then
spacex,removed,hey i was at burning man and
spacex,removed,did we even try to develop a trampoline
spacex,removed,just ran a gift range calculator for billion gift rangenumber of gifts requirednumber of prospects requiredsubtotalcumulative totalcumulative percentage under totals so if it distributed well you could actually get people to donate under in short i can see a separate launch working if it was set up as a nonprofit wing of spacex with the goal of sending the first lab to mars
spacex,removed,as a brit id like to go and make martian tea
spacex,removed,what happened to the nro speech thread
spacex,removed,lol no rain lots of brake dust
spacex,removed,godforsaken thats a very big positive for some
spacex,removed,huh i honestly have no idea why that entire post was deleted the op said that he had verified it was okay to publicize with the nro itself nevertheless here is a pure text transcript of musk did indeed state reportedly that rtf was looking to be early december with another launch in early january from vandenberg iridium and that spacex was still looking to refly this year in other words is intended to be the rtf and is net early december with iridium net a month or so after
spacex,removed,as a european is there a chance for me europe is nice we have nice rockets and food but still thats far from usa
spacex,removed,you are joking arent you you will be thousands of miles away from the launch you might see the second stage after it is in orbit
spacex,removed,finally the world will see the studio where all the moon landings were filmed
spacex,removed,remind me one week
spacex,removed,can i get a military id just to watch this
spacex,removed,naw with amazon prime you still get free shipping it just takes a long time
spacex,removed,i see ula had another successful launch but as expected they had another failed booster recovery lets see if i calculated this right that makes a failure rate for booster recovery for ula doesnt it when will ula have a successful booster recovery
spacex,removed,i read this as heading to ksp
spacex,removed,s just died i think
spacex,removed,do you actually have any sources on this i do
spacex,removed,just a quick update i havent seen a first stage core in sydney australia just thought you should know
spacex,removed,checking in from canada i havent seen any rockets lately but ive got my eyes peeled
spacex,removed,just once id like to see a core on the highway they need to start launching some from up here in canada
spacex,removed,boosterspotters
spacex,removed,httpsnsidcorgdataseaiceindeximagesdailyimagesnstddevtimeseriespng
spacex,removed,does anyone else initially think kerbin when ksc is mentioned
spacex,removed,theres a solution to that kerbal space program
spacex,removed,space clinic
spacex,removed,if only
spacex,removed,bummer
spacex,removed,just land it on the engine bells like in ksp p
spacex,removed,elon is supposed to be a supervillain i say impact targeting test
spacex,removed,metal
spacex,removed,well we can forget about it itll still be back though
spacex,removed,perhaps it is a new acronym using the same letters they might be running out of letter combinations
spacex,removed,i dont know about anyone else but i was a tiny bit nervous when i clicked on this headline
spacex,removed,thats a hell of an erection elon
spacex,removed,dude wtf this is awesome
spacex,removed,baz
spacex,removed,well you just inspired a remake of a certain cult game with a new setting and the same exact game over message
spacex,removed,ill take one ticket to the stars please
spacex,removed,or the one that says dragon has landed at carrying astronauts back from the space station
spacex,removed,yay rspacex and i share a birthday glad it wasnt rspacedicks or something like that
spacex,removed,science
spacex,removed,pounds please kilograms lol
spacex,removed,ha i think the last thing id want to see during mars edl would be a view of the surface rushing up to meet me at terrifying speeds before the landing burn kicked in at the last possible moment
spacex,removed,if you look left you can see the first colony coming into view on your right you can see dense green forests climbing the slopes of olympus mons
spacex,removed,amaryllis
spacex,removed,why pussies
spacex,removed,looks like its seen some shit
spacex,removed,oh man your going to give that guy who says spacex fakes their launches ideas
spacex,removed,of what quality is this comment
spacex,removed,this is a good point of debate we humans will carry to mars a shitton of alien microparasites and whatnot that resides on our own bodies so is very doable that they will evolve in a way that they will survive the mars conditions so maybe in the future you can safely say i cant go today with you guys i got mars flu
spacex,removed,gotta farm that science
spacex,removed,they say it was a splash down and show videos of it crashing into the ocean then they claim they were able to get it to land upside down on a barge its the same footage just played backwards wake up people as sad as it if we have never been in space
spacex,removed,this group seems to have isolated it as shrapnel from the strongback which exploded first and pierced the rocket and tanks
spacex,removed,techx seems to have isolated an explosion on the strongback as the source of shrapnel which pierced the rocket and helium tank
spacex,removed,you seem to have a good analytical mindset what do you think of this analysis
spacex,removed,the breach was caused by shrapnel from a strongback explosion
spacex,removed,the copv was breached bit it wasnt the first pop the first pop was off rocket caused by a exosion on the strongback which ejected shrapnel into the rocket
spacex,removed,off rocket explosion started on the strongback due to lox condensation and atmospheric coronal ingnition source caused by approaching thunderstorm this produced shrapnel which breached the helium system
spacex,removed,best analysis i have seen shows off rocket explosion source on the strongback leading to shrapnel piercing rocket and systems
spacex,removed,coronal discharge off metal is not ball lighting
spacex,removed,i have no idea what you are talking about a giy piped inwith some claimed inside information which is the basis for the original post humans do the easy thing which tend not to subject them to too much scrutiny is all i said
spacex,removed,i have a feeling many spacex fanboys and girls will not like this very poignant and on point article
spacex,removed,yeah inconel is very heavy the navy uses if for their nuclear reactors
spacex,removed,thanks very clear and it shoud but will not shut up all the claims that it was really the copv that failed there as well
spacex,removed,it was a ufo
spacex,removed,its gwynne time actually
spacex,removed,god i love this guy hes totally mad
spacex,removed,right and the explosion shrapnel from the strognback explosion would fit that nicely included the early spunds before the helium tank failed
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,i know this is the craziest idea ive had in a while but stay with me what if the falcon was shot with a sniper rifle on purpose from far away
spacex,removed,has someone taking a shot with a rifle been ruled out
spacex,removed,in a hurry to fill that tankslow down boys and girls😗✌️
spacex,removed,lol love it
spacex,removed,upvote for bad pun at the end
spacex,removed,thickness of the liner is not the problem its the large delta in the thermal expansion rates of carbon fiber vs aluminum which causes delamination even if they increased the thickness from arbitrary numbers i dont know exactly how thick they are to that thickness alone is not enough to contain so if the cf layer delaminates it will explode no matter what
spacex,removed,in that case it was a little short on fins and laser cannons
spacex,removed,bfr big fucking rocket
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,i want them to have lasers whether they need them or not
spacex,removed,

spacex,removed,the various tweets so much lack of hashtaggery its unusual normally tweets are all some thing and this other thing maybeoneis clever
spacex,removed,food and science america never dissapoints
spacex,removed,i dont know wouldnt it be better with the business end of merlins painted on the back
spacex,removed,ptztv is an ass and we wont be working with them again
spacex,removed,i would just drive that around for no reason just because
spacex,removed,i just want to say fuck that guy he has no understanding of the law or capitalism or how things would even happen point blank no one here broke the law disabling parts of a website is controlling what happens on your computer it does not break the law it cannot violate anything they have a right to block people from accessing the site but as long as you do not interfere with their system on their servers you are not violating any law any adblocker has no ability to interfere with the remote servers this guy is an utter idiot and i encourage everyone to join in boycotting his website
spacex,removed,i wouldnt mind doing cfd analysis on fume extraction and optimum placement of that exhaust on top you can generate various combos of food that the chef can burn at a given time to remain in the optimum range of fume extractionthatll be fun s
spacex,removed,we all understood he was just being a dick because your grammar wasnt so hot in that sentence
spacex,removed,wait until they get the martian cattle ranches going spacex catering farm to table
spacex,removed,best seller rocket pops
spacex,removed,but its natural we all know thats perfectly fine
spacex,removed,thats why i drink salted water to bring out the natural flavored
spacex,removed,nofilter
spacex,removed,i give it years before its fully autonomous both driving and food preparations
spacex,removed,ill take the falcon deluxe please
spacex,removed,get out and push
spacex,removed,indeed of people who drink water will in fact die
spacex,removed,space food for earth people or earth food for space people
spacex,removed,the food is out of this world
spacex,removed,i know that your probably a fan boy but the harsh truth is that china and russia are well ahead of spacex in terms of space technology they both have fucking space stations that actually orbit the earth
spacex,removed,apparently my lighthearted comment wasnt serious enough for a the importance of the spacex food truckpaint job thread this is why people unsub it also looks like there was a culling throughout the thread i urge the admins to to chillax youll lose people this way
spacex,removed,its just a regular truck with a decal on it what are you so excited about
spacex,removed,its just a regular truck with a decal on it what are you so excited about
spacex,removed,giant bargeswallowing submarine see the next james bond movie
spacex,removed,is that someone uautomoderator
spacex,removed,with apologies with all that fire in the graphics on the side of the truck i sure hope they have some hot food or is their frozen food cryogenic
spacex,removed,i think we just found the falcon heavy demo payload guys
spacex,removed,so hes the ceo the chef executive officer
spacex,removed,how much would it be worth to you if i told you i had a app called pied piper tracking the location of your child using a spacex satellite constellation i can follow your child anywhere and there is nothing you can do to stop me most missing children are never found interested very interested or very interested
spacex,removed,the reason its going to take so long to expand is because an astronaut has to blow it up like a balloon
spacex,removed,ive suspected ula sabotage from the minute i saw the video but not from someone shooting the rocket but maybe from something placed on the satellite that sent out a heat source to cause the explosion that way all evidence would be destroyed in the inferno but maybe a rogue ula employee pulled this off
spacex,removed,that may be the only reason hed be okay doing it christ i was practically grinding my teeth at the end of the event were getting ready to colonize another god damned planet and those assholes were talking about shitting at burning man and giving him a kiss its unfortunate those idiots squandered such a great opportunity to actually learn something meaningful
spacex,removed,yeah the amount of white people mad about fb giving free internet to indians without any internet was pretty high
spacex,removed,wasnt the payload a facebook sat developed and built in israel if you want to believe if conspiracy theories about facebook and the intelligence communities then it seems to me there could be any number of bad actors including our own government
spacex,removed,except we dont have a trump sad
spacex,removed,wait if osi is investigating are we thinking that the guild of calamitous intent did this
spacex,removed,how many crew members do you reckon will be necessary on a typical person flight could you elaborate on the job roles captain mate stewards doctor maintenance crew etc
spacex,removed,questions to ask elon what did you think of future of fusion have other reviews youve read of burning reported shit storms since last ask do you have any more information on interstellar travel real question can all future qa have their questions screened so it isnt a shit show again and waste everyone time and make elon question why we even need a back up hard drive
spacex,removed,if not then to what outside sources was musk referring my point is that you are making things up he never didnt said anything about sabotage it is your fantasy and your lie you lot should go to rconspiracy with that made up bs shouldnt have place in rspacex i personally blame mod drama booting out echo for current low quality of sub
spacex,removed,dont worry poor indians white people here to make decisions for you
spacex,removed,you might think not but then theres
spacex,removed,its weird to find so many neigh sayers to be fans of spacex which is trying to do what people insisted being impossible i guess its fanboys being fanboys no idea maybe i accidentally triggered im image of bezos in your mind no idea but you should get that fixed before you insist on a traffic light showing the wrong color and having no idea about streets and vehicles
spacex,removed,more info plz
spacex,removed,uppop hello
spacex,removed,yeah fck ruds
spacex,removed,do you recall the name of the thread
spacex,removed,the most bad ass ever
spacex,removed,i cant believe this is actually happening elon is a mad man
spacex,removed,just want to say i love the new changing background great iconic images
spacex,removed,im hoping that his alliance with donald trump will give us speedy launch schedules
spacex,removed,does anyone else look at this picture and see legos
spacex,removed,this is starting to sound like thordelta ultra super extra extended long tank thor mark ii
spacex,removed,falcon
spacex,removed,i sure hope fh launches earlier than the year
spacex,removed,ah you must mean the year of the linux desktop
spacex,removed,ya thats the problem when your country is really just a gas station run by the mafia and your government is only a vehicle to extract money and dump it in switzerland bank accounts meanwhile the peasants are waving flags singing national anthems and clapping like seals when a man pushes a ball behind a line ie soccer
spacex,removed,im convinced the vast majority of flatearthers dont really believe the earth is flat they just enjoy trolling people and are playing a sort of character for fun
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,ileantm
spacex,removed,thats kind of scary on that second data point shows how good the roman catholic church brainwashing is make a populist pope to play to the desires of modern people and you get more conversions
spacex,removed,this is earth not heaven
spacex,removed,solid amazing
spacex,removed,falcon heavy features three ninecore merlin engines what d
spacex,removed,i hear multiple women have left you due to your obsessive addiction to work wanna get it on sure but youll have to give me a minute i just had this great idea for a new battery design and i want to write it down
spacex,removed,why would you want bright tools what purpose does that serve
spacex,removed,with no regard for human martian life
spacex,removed,also obviously autistic but i guess nobody wants to say it
spacex,removed,spacex engineers hearing about this for the first time when elon tells the rest of the world
spacex,removed,need to start colonization efforts get things ready for mass exodus when earth completely goes to shit
spacex,removed,i felt a great disturbance in the live stream as if thousands of engineers suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly alarmed i imagine something wonderful has happened
spacex,removed,hello darkness my old friend ive come to talk with you again
spacex,removed,can i go
spacex,removed,do you mean benicio del toro
spacex,removed,yeah you are absolutely right good luck with your dome
spacex,removed,of people who write articles do less than seconds of research and fail to have a basic understanding of physics or logic and they also dont care hence why they always make stupid obvious mistakes it infuriates me also the non rspacex readersgeneral public will belive them over you because the author has it written down on a webpage or bit of paper and your just some guywho obviously knows nothing because you dont have your name on a bit of paper if i ever rulewhen i rule the world i will make writing articles with factual mistakes punishable by public ermdont want to sound to extreme hereerm public ridicule and the banning of further article writing for the period of year and the mandatory attendance of classes intended to bring the accused up to a reasonable level of education
spacex,removed,theres no way even a falcon heavy rud could break up a block of lead it would fall into the ocean and could be fished out in one piece unless the rud is due to strut failure resulting in a large block of lead falling into the lox tank and the resulting explosion melting part of the lead into small droplets strewn around 😋
spacex,removed,sean probst elon musk

spacex,removed,just wait for a good day and launch from all launch pads
spacex,removed,at that rate well be sending humans there faster than we thinkunu is on to something
spacex,removed,fusion reactors built with graphene going to mars
spacex,removed,got a call from the boss man he said to just put a few blocks of wood underneath and well be good to go youve got to be joking dont question the elon
spacex,removed,i died min ago when i joined xd
spacex,removed,i imagine its a gigantic sugar packet
spacex,removed,they would be landing at the same time too i think we need a bigger barge
spacex,removed,thats what folks in the ghetto refer to as a
spacex,removed,make the payload a used core
spacex,removed,im not gay but elon musk is elon musk

spacex,removed,you sir are a dedicated fan of engineering i commend you
spacex,removed,catapult it through the roof hatch
spacex,removed,i sent spacex an email requesting they launch a yellow school bus would be a good mass simulator and it would be awesome if it was a surprise until the fairings open they could partner up with the people behind the magic school bus for publicity maybe put it in the same orbit as the iss so it slowly drifts by as they snap some shots
spacex,removed,needs a giant bow on it like what car sales men use its a gift to the world from spacex
spacex,removed,it is rocket science haha
spacex,removed,wasnt sure if this was rwhatisthisbird
spacex,removed,that is frickin lit
spacex,removed,ill be in the middle of an exam damn i cant even watch it live
spacex,removed,ridiculous yes exactly thats the word lol
spacex,removed,undoubtedly one due for delay
spacex,removed,kkk hi
spacex,removed,i upvoted but cant remove your comment aaaaaand deleted
spacex,removed,clap
spacex,removed,id read it as a typo for two layers
spacex,removed,i read this as spacex air force asses more landing pads dragon processing at
spacex,removed,sheesh lighten up dude
spacex,removed,kinda looks like a bfd
spacex,removed,this made me burst into a single audible ha loud enough for my roommate to wake up and text me a yeah good work op
spacex,removed,somebody at spacex needs to hire you
spacex,removed,maybe but right now it seems to be a case of dont fix what isnt broken and to be pedantic a successor vehicle to the falcon would likely be falcon derived architecture therefore being a part of the falcon family
spacex,removed,side note would this be referred to as martial law nope definitely not qualified
spacex,removed,every day i feel like i am living in the future
spacex,removed,op already explained they are mating
spacex,removed,dont tell that to the elon
spacex,removed,that graphic is inaccurate the flag doesnt say trump and the caption doesnt say president trump mars landing was tremendous i know so many martians they like me so much theyre tremendous beings
spacex,removed,probably where they are going to launch the cablesnet to catch the incoming rocket so it doesnt fall over s
spacex,removed,i hope well see well i was in the neighborhood and dont try this at home for an additional drone ships if theyre needed for higher launch cadence than one can support or alldpl fh if they make a much larger one for bfr it should be called so much for subtlety
spacex,removed,goosebumps
spacex,removed,we could have returned cores im just imagining that meme of the guy holding limes but the limes replaced with returned stages captioned why cant i hold all these falcons
spacex,removed,screw you
spacex,removed,nobody in the government even thought of needing a landing pad for rockets
spacex,removed,as does your comment
spacex,removed,kittyhawk if so then its like the ptztv drama only difference is that ptztv sometimes streamed hours and hours if not days of fairly static picture
spacex,removed,democrats get control of congress an alternative let me be very clear that i am not promoting to unseat some of these republicans the democrat candidates would probably have to convince their corporate constituents the same representation will be provided
spacex,removed,it aborts up and over like the kennedy assassination
spacex,removed,cant forget that lunch window
spacex,removed,if you had bothered to watch an orion abort test vid you wouldnt make that ignorant statement regarding parachutes and flames and shit
spacex,removed,well trump has stated thats hes a yuge supporter of the private space sector i think youll see spacex prosper if he is i think hillary is fairly neutral i dont think shell shake up anything i think itll be like the last years the only person who has shown to be antinasa was bernie and he doesnt stand a chance so i think were pretty safe the only thing we dont seem to have any science geeks running which i would like to see id like to see nasas budget doubletriple but thats not going to happen
spacex,removed,mmhh yeah sure bye
spacex,removed,to patrons point hopefully it will take some time before the fix is in between oldspace and the possible democrat congress to levalis and noggin i am offended by your insensitivitycorporations are people too and youd better let them pee wherever they want now being serious for osu and all if it goes democrat the head of the party is demonstrably corrupt and will be entirely comfortable working with oldspace and oh by the way do you know about my foundation its just that ive seen the current crop of justthisshortofcorrupt congressmen on youtube too many times and read the sycophantic articles in spacenews too many times but enough of that nro announced today that spacex will be launching in march live for the day
spacex,removed,sls is a bottomless money pit falcon and falcon heavy are where its at the spacex brf will probably be flying before sls is ready for humans
spacex,removed,are you implying the falcon is a fertility symbol
spacex,removed,a sensor network of surveillance drones permanent coverage of hawthorne mcgregor boca chica port canaveral and wahoo nebraska where elons really really really secret base is oops this isnt public is it
spacex,removed,plz be delayed for day so i can have an early cake day present
spacex,removed,some crazy asshat could try to shoot it is this a normal problem
spacex,removed,i really hope this is delayed by one day so it launches on my cake day
spacex,removed,but the lotterycigarette salesetc were supposed to replace that money so we could use it elsewhere s
spacex,removed,argh here in italy i hope it doesnt get delayed again or i might not sleep at all
spacex,removed,that was a remarkably vacuous comment i congratulate you the next time you spend your life being in a minority group that gets sick of being mistreated and chooses to invest their time in other ways you let us know
spacex,removed,im kinda torn i really want the launch to happen sooner not later but id be kinda ecstatic if it slipped another two days because the is my birthday
spacex,removed,ball cosy
spacex,removed,and what excuse can they really give spacex is hauling a potentially dangerous object back to port have you tried the food aboard a carnival cruise ship i dare say that might be more potentially toxic than the residual chemicals left behind in stage
spacex,removed,ah yes the domino theory of wharf extortion dumbest post ive read here recently you gotta pick your battles every minute wasted fighting a wharf in florida is one less minute spent getting your ass to mars
spacex,removed,ah yes the ol
spacex,removed,the fifth s is for suicide or sodomy
spacex,removed,its a government program so they want to maximize cost
spacex,removed,later
spacex,removed,brilliant if some people are to be believed mct and bfr will launch a nuclear reactor shaped like bernie sanders into geostationary orbit times per day while being refuelled for free by methaneexcreting gmo algae grown in boca chica
spacex,removed,i love this sub
spacex,removed,kimmy really wants his icbms rockets
spacex,removed,if some people are to be believed mct and bfr will launch a nuclear reactor shaped like bernie sanders into geostationary orbit times per day while being refuelled for free by methaneexcreting gmo algae grown in boca chica i am so glad the mods didnt ban you for this excellent post thank you
spacex,removed,go anally violate yourself you humorless twit
spacex,removed,the general expectation is vastly different mars exo will never survive work whateverfine raise hell about it all spacex can consistently land rockets now will nasa go for thisit would be cheaper but accept a large amount of huuuge even yuuuge risksno if you want sls fine sunk costbut its great on engineering and stupid on fucking results id be more sympathetic if i were using a rivet guneh esa its common problem most rockets there are rockets by committeeand yours blew up more than a few timesit was just at once expect a ban but lets let nasa cc funding work like it shouldthe assholes i had to argue with are mean folks me i think a healthy and honest appraisal of he did what with his own money and so forth and yaddaits gonna be billion do it
spacex,removed,given an apparent annual deficit of billion of uk to eu brevity might just be a yuge stimulus my wish is uk put nuke subs on hold and do skylon put liquid fluoride salt nukes to work on gasifying coal to hydrogen and other carbon based liquids eg lng this would placate carbonworriers and get back the coal mining industry the nation state is at risk six million of the remainers were outsiders without any cultural interest for the forgotten man
spacex,removed,kids and i got nothing to say still have to live here and be annoyed that michigan sucks for everyone caught you sing song caught with soundgarden should i go batty about it being an indian guy what shows up for local housing no capability for him or you i have plenty of music let me know when one of you shows up
spacex,removed,what a cry baby
spacex,removed,spacex is wasting money on such position i thought spacex should have more concentration i reducing cost
spacex,removed,good riddance that kind of individual would a liability with the present administration by the way his post is extremely politic and completely irrelevant to spacex is that allowed on this sub
spacex,removed,well theres this mars rocket thingy that needs funding
spacex,removed,space is big truer words have never been spoken
spacex,removed,i read spacex has filed and panicked
spacex,removed,china gonna love this
spacex,removed,source
spacex,removed,that should be the company demo for the test sats
spacex,removed,is the ultimate end game to create a dyson sphere
spacex,removed,it beats stealing underpants
spacex,removed,this whole argument reinforces musks point about urgently expanding off planet so some unforeseen calamity doesnt strand our species the only known sentient and technological species in all creation on the rock till it is gobbled up by our sun not a good reason to abandon the task at hand but spacex and musk will carry on democrat ideals have become synonymous with intellect and its just not true the idea that the the republicans are wrong and evil and that the democrats are correct and benevolent flies in the face of the observable data and is patently false clinton inc is a shining example of democratic malfeasance
spacex,removed,should be called please dont burst test
spacex,removed,i believe so however trump is an orange and was eligible thats discrimination
spacex,removed,unfortunately i viewed thedonald as just a bunch of deplorable trolls and didnt sub there ive joined up or checked in on almost every nowbanned subreddit and never ever have i seen more of a bubble than thedonald according to exsubscribers even if you honestly support the candidate and express clearly as much you are likely to be banned if you dont regularly voice your hate for the opposition or at least keep casual racism or sexism in your comment history there are now a couple subs dedicated to former thedonald subscribers who try to figure out what they were banned for
spacex,removed,i will point out that rthedonald is not representative of trumps average supporters this is true while most racists and sexists voted for trump not all trump supporters are racists and sexists this is an important distinction to be made
spacex,removed,insert obligatory monty python its a witch quote here
spacex,removed,suck it comcast sorry i just had to this is absolutely awesome
spacex,removed,he actively modding just not posting talked with him yesterday
spacex,removed,i paged the mods just the other day and echo responded so yes but hes probably busy
spacex,removed,and is mbps if you could offer million people unlimited anywhere on earth for youd have million people on your service if you could promise mbps on average to million id fucking die of happiness if they could even offer million people they would be making so much money this is potentially worth of billion of dollars and that money could then be used to launch more sats and they are also doing the whole production process just like to the rockets i think which will save costs and allow him to scale up production just like he is doing with tesla and if he manged to scale up solar city with all these companies he might be on track to being the richest man if tesla solar city spacex and a telecom company could coordinate to ride the exponential curve at best time to all maximize profit that would be the ultimate types of companies to do that with i think he will have companies throwing money at him if the launch cadences take off in in and after spacex alone will be taking billions from investors and tesla and solar city could be doing the same this satellite thing could be worth even more with openai to analyze all the data generated by these companies i think by openai will be putting out ai so powerful itll be quite insane things seem to be coming together is a really awesome high positive impact kind of way
spacex,removed,i got the pun on the first read if that counts for anything
spacex,removed,kart give pics or riot ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
spacex,removed,your constant obsession with sourcing is pretty absurd youre worse than the whole bunch who freaking cares its a photo of a damn newspaper
spacex,removed,what a email oo evalongusafmil
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,i
spacex,removed,dang thats a lot for delta v than in ksp
spacex,removed,spacex indicated the weight of the landing legs in teslas so i dont see any problem with this
spacex,removed,just more left in the entire world one is elons the other is echos
spacex,removed,i had a comment removed for comparing the ula chief commenting on spacex to donald trump commenting on hillary clinton politics aside this needs to be seen as someone commenting on their competition i like this sub but the mods are dicks
spacex,removed,if you want to launch immediately without seeing some tests and the right booster does the same time he did i think i understand that there is no reason to comment on fh otherwise
spacex,removed,best mods on reddit if you ask me or vice
spacex,removed,bill nye is full of shit always has been ive posted here before why fh aint launching before jan at least not from
spacex,removed,when the post would not be good for it
spacex,removed,dont want to start a conspiracy theory but maybe someone shot the rocket eg the common bulkhead i suggested just this a few days back and my comment was deleted but it would be a perfect explanation for what happened
spacex,removed,could it have been sabotage like a bullet going off
spacex,removed,how hard it would be for someone to shoot a rocket with a sniper rifle from a few miles away is the area accessible
spacex,removed,how close to the rocket can someone outside space x get i have no idea and would like to know thanks
spacex,removed,possible modfodder but this guy gets my vote
spacex,removed,maybe a lexan blast screen warped or sagged due to the heat of previous launches creating a concave reflective surface that focussed the sunlight
spacex,removed,a clever crow got fed up with all the noise and figured out how to sabotage the thing
spacex,removed,they should watch apollo again im guessing kevin bacon had something to do with this explosion
spacex,removed,methinks ula hired a sharpshooter to shoot from miles away totally doable s
spacex,removed,no wonder what was the last one a rocked didnt land correctly this is a whole new level of disaster
spacex,removed,hahaha he wishes
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,im sure there are people out there who want to harm the israeli telecom industry neither is likely but foreign body contact is an explanation im sure spacex is considering
spacex,removed,he knows xd
spacex,removed,im not even remotely a conspiracy theorist however it sounds quite a lot like elon is endorsing the possibility that it is from an external source otherwise there is no way he would have replied to this tweet i can see no other way of interpreting these tweets
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,speaking from experience theres no way a small drone could penetrate the skin of a falcon you might want to rephrase that
spacex,removed,some sort of tetryon emission in eps conduits causing a destabilization of the cochrane field
spacex,removed,not really spacex is causing other companies and countries to lose billions and making space programs around the world look really bad dont forget ula tried hamstringing spacex multiple times through government connections its widely speculated that ula used connections to force spacex to launch the falcon from an island which corrussion issues directly impacted at least launch and they and blue origion tried to cock block spacex on the platform even though those two companies had no immediate use for the launch facility
spacex,removed,maybe dont code in objective c or whatever it is from an island which corrussion issues directly impacted at least any good sized object
spacex,removed,wow its been going for over years some of the top posts were in the last weeks thats one hell of an active community just as well really because my makerov phaseharmonizer is of the old style with the analogue inverter one of the old rutherford models which has been failing recently and ive been unable to find an acceptable digital replacement these guys should set me straight
spacex,removed,read about the payload owned and made by the state of israel for communication purposes
spacex,removed,annoying indeed the rocket blew up on the launchpad because steve forgot to add a bracket goddamit not again
spacex,removed,you assume that jeff bezos is one unique entity
spacex,removed,i knew aliens would find their way into this thread eventually
spacex,removed,possibly some sort of config file for the salty kwajalein environment
spacex,removed,cool explosion confirmed by elon
spacex,removed,if a bird did hit the rocket could it cause this we know birds can bring down jet planes
spacex,removed,dave here it was a stupid mistake you see my wife had been on my ass all that morning and i thought to myself hey dave why dont you climb up the le and take a selfie to impress that witch with your job as post launch pad cleaner while she believes your lies that you is a rocket scientist wcgw she keeps on my ass about men are from mars bs cause i told her that i want to go there to get away from her nagging ass and that is why i am a post launch pad cleaner really big job title obviously it didnt work and i forgot my freegin camera up there and well you know the rest
spacex,removed,so if a bird hit the fuel lines or anything like that it wouldnt create a spark or anything
spacex,removed,since we already know that elon isnt a terran native perhaps the bezoids are the ones who exiled him here
spacex,removed,we have not ruled that out elon has seen enough that something hitting the rocket is likely a more valid conclusion than than anything else and theyre trying to prove otherwise someone shot it with a suppressed rifle
spacex,removed,withnit being an israeli sat i wouldnt rule out sabataoge or evil space lazers
spacex,removed,there are some videos on youtube claiming something hit the rocket any reality there elonmusk we have not ruled that out tory bruno at it again but with a rifle instead of a laser now please excuse me while i go hijack the media peoples productionquality sound gear and five it a listen
spacex,removed,conspiracy what was on that rocket
spacex,removed,i know the mods are anti conspiracy but there are companies and nations that will profit from this accident i am not saying its so but if there is no corresponding data that appears rocket related it needs to be considered as a last resort
spacex,removed,ive no idea what the exclusion zone is miles is too far for someone to get a very accurate shot at it but its a big target and how accurate would they really need to be any bullet that penetrated a tank could cause rud even a can travel well over a mile before the air eventually slows it down ive been considering that it could be a sniper since about days after it happened but i never said anything until now i had a few cans of beer in the back of my van and one of them fell over and landed on a small pebble that tiny amount of pressure on a small spot of the can was enough to rupture it and start spraying beer all over the van
spacex,removed,maybe bob could get the laundry to investigate nothing to see here
spacex,removed,a stealth boeing drone the only other private company competing for nasa contracts
spacex,removed,idk but a stealth drone with heretofore undisclosed weaponry could be the solution
spacex,removed,unless its a stealthcloaked drone developed by the other tech giantboeing competing for contracts with nasa
spacex,removed,why is sabotage considered a conspiracy theory crazier things have happened
spacex,removed,would a bullet impact lead to what we see on the video though what could it hit that would cause the observed fast detonation fuel and oxidiser are not already mixed so i honestly wouldnt expect a bullet to make that kind of explosion a bullet impact seems like one of the less plausible sabotage theories if were going with sabotage hacking woild seem like a good route see stuxnet because theres a massive amount of deniability or perhaps some kind of inside job deliberate mistake any direct physical attack on the rocket seems like a very bad option even if we look at foul play
spacex,removed,more silly speculation could be a russian covert ops with a high power laser aimed at the oxygen pipe from a very great distance pipe itself turns into a bomb pops come from heat expansion right before the pipe selfignites then newspaper in russia publishes really oddlame story saying obama administration lasered the rocket to sabotage the chinese deal they were probably worried spacex would detect a laser was used so tried to get a misdirecting laser story out there early on motive they want more soyuz contracts plausibility putin is in charge over there
spacex,removed,this is what happens when you devote half your budget to online propaganda
spacex,removed,he blew it up on purpose to stop facebook from turning into a monopoly but cant say anything publicly
spacex,removed,a bmg silvertip api would most likely go through and ignite the fuel and a trained sniper with lets say a barret could make that shot at or more
spacex,removed,not like spacex doesnt have enemies could it be triggered by a directed high energy laser
spacex,removed,why didnt he check reddit we had it figured out as soon as it happened
spacex,removed,im starting to think it was purposefully destroyed something hit it
spacex,removed,im going with a laden european swallow
spacex,removed,if someone shot at the rocket whats the closest they could possibly be to hit it or furthest away could they or would they know to aim for something specific interesting possibilities lots of crazy people out there
spacex,removed,motive lets see musks family has previously said they fear the russians might try to assassinate musk the chinese are also possible options here the rest of the world has been catching up to some of the things the us has historically been the best at musk represents a new paradim where us dominance continues unabated into the final frontier i can see people trying to stop that and thats just two possible nation state actors ula certainly has enough on the line as well
spacex,removed,first rocket killed by meteorite kidding of course this sure is interesting
spacex,removed,wrench
spacex,removed,dont forget people love a good story evil communists russians take out young american rocket companys rocket using super secret special silenced gun and ammo evil islamists take out israeli satellite on launch pad bbeg tony bruno and friends at lockheed and boeing plot to destroy the reputation of a young usurping rocket company that threatens their monopoly glorious internet freedom fighters destroy the evil mega spy corp facebooks comm sat meant to force africans to use censored internet bbeg means big bad evil guy for those of this subreddit that dont play roleplaying games
spacex,removed,damn you jennthepatriot get some cop on
spacex,removed,govt railgun ofc
spacex,removed,the bigger question is who would do this and why i can answer that one there are a lot of conspiracy nuts that do everything in their power to stop israel was israeli
spacex,removed,the conspiracy is in full swing after the jaussi was set on fire halting the next target became spacex s
spacex,removed,i hate to get into conspiracy theories but someone could make millions trading derivatives on spacecom buy puts a couple trading sessions earlier go out and cause the crash profit
spacex,removed,oring failure ahh cruel joke
spacex,removed,bob could get the laundry to investigate clearly all of the three redundant flight computers and the comsat got infested by a otherworldly entity and the rocket had to be cleansed just to be sure we were spared a geo comsat blasting out old enochian broadcasting at full power instead of all the tv channels
spacex,removed,whats to stop someone sniping the rocket from a good distance away
spacex,removed,soooooo contact irl confirmed
spacex,removed,is it physically to destroy a falcon rupture the tanks or any other rocket by shooting it with a barrett or something similar in caliber i was wondering this since someone suggested the explosion was caused by this crazy i know if this is indeed possible i really shows just how thin the tanks are and how delicate a rocket actually is
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,also an israeli satellite that will be used to host facebooks controversial internet service lots of conspiracy bait to feed on here
spacex,removed,yeah nobody hates the israelis or facebook or elon
spacex,removed,who are you calling subhuman
spacex,removed,anyone considered a terrorist atacksabotage yet
spacex,removed,im curious as to what range people have access to witness the rockets taking off if they are truly interested in audio i wonder if they are trying to pinpoint a location from some party sourcelike a rifle shot or something i wouldnt hold it past some crazy guy that doesnt like this new company coming along it could also explain the that they heard before hand
spacex,removed,also i get to drive to the shooting range in my monster truck with a bald eagle on my shoulder a hamburger in one hand and the declaration of independence in the other but steering actually dont answer that
spacex,removed,rnosleep
spacex,removed,dont be silly ofc it was aliens what else could it be
spacex,removed,keep in mind that a flying spaghetti monsters reaching out his noodly appendage transcending space and time to cause the anomaly has not been rules out either
spacex,removed,since weve clearly veered into the realm of wild speculation what is the range of those laser weapons that can destroy missiles
spacex,removed,not if it was a laser or microwave
spacex,removed,the message elon is sending is clear they have not ruled out foul play i always had worry about some crazy dude with a gun shooting the rocket a bourne like operation is the scariest one
spacex,removed,if i had to pick between a satelite for facebook in africa or a human payload meant for mars well sorry zucc
spacex,removed,they just really have no value even though thats not very practical
spacex,removed,since were putting on our tinfoil hats in the immortal words of the dude qui bono who stands to gain from this failure follow the money
spacex,removed,they just really have no value even though thats not very practical
spacex,removed,dicks out for musk kitties
spacex,removed,no you are not crazy calling someone a conspiracy theorist and banning discussion on this is insane but thats par for the course in weimar america
spacex,removed,nice analysis if you listen to the original video hear closely between and those seconds are key i hear one shot the shooter for mission assurance and the object hitting the rocket but thats just the craziest thing i could ever imagine
spacex,removed,fucks sake dave
spacex,removed,like surveying the state of the rocket is basically the broad side of a rocket the size of a provider not being up to specs
spacex,removed,does anyone know if there are any grassy knolls or book depositories near the launchpad
spacex,removed,well yes but consider this elon posts a limited amount of tweets that means if he gives an answer like that hes essentially validating that scenario now it seems as if they are really considering that a likely possibility but i assume its good for spacex pr as now more people will talk about whatwhowhy shot the rocket or if it was aliens instead of talking about the failure itself and critizing spacex
spacex,removed,sabotage is surely the least likely explanation but on the other hand a us rocket suddenly blowing up on the pad with the engines off is also very unlikely didnt someone say that hasnt happened since the and this would be the sort of situation where two low probabilities work to cancel each other out still very improbable but conceivable possibly the most suspicious thing is that spacex somehow determined the last inflight failures cause almost immediately but now a rocket blew up right on the pad with presumably absurd amounts of monitoring equipment on and around it and they seem completely baffled even asking the community for extra videos or data whatever happened it must have been something pretty weird wasnt aliens though no matter how much youtube obsesses over those bugs flying past the camera
spacex,removed,the only rational motive to shoot it would be to make it look like a system failure in order to do that the shot cannot hit just anywhere a sudden failure in a place that has nothing but tankage which is the vast majority of the vehicle would be obvious sabotage likewise its no good hitting the payload instead it has to land near some critical component such as the fueling couplings this is a much smaller target and is obscured by strongback structure and the fog of venting whats more the firing position would have to have line of sight to the correct side of the vehicle and be a good hide with routes for ingress egress and protection from the explosion debris its possible but it does not seem especially plausible
spacex,removed,russians
spacex,removed,i think some sabotage of some sort seems like a significant possibility like you said it doesnt even need to be some sinister plot could have been a lone wolf or a drunk guy
spacex,removed,crossed my mind too it is florida after all
spacex,removed,it was ivan vanko
spacex,removed,now i cant get the song sabotage out of my head
spacex,removed,what about some sort of directed energy weapon ie laser they exist and would leave very little trace evidence behind its possible a nonstate corporate actor has a vested interest in slowing down spacexs progress as much as possible
spacex,removed,perhaps it was the debris of the missile that hit the pentagon in
spacex,removed,blowing up a rocket on an air force base is a crazy stupid thing to do so like httpwwwredditcomrfloridaman levels of stupid
spacex,removed,reddit brought me here
spacex,removed,sooooo maybe it was a ufo then
spacex,removed,a low rumple a metallic squink a galonk someone crying out dear god someone needs to make a gif of the seinfeld scene where george leaves a tape recorder in his briefcase and they try to figure out what the sounds are
spacex,removed,i understand this is tinfoil hat territory but at the back of my mind im thinking that some kind of subtle sabotage by a jealous spacex competitor sounds plausible theres certainly motive
spacex,removed,after the speculations today even not denied by elon itself about something from the outside being the responsible of the incident all the debates about it being shot or something wouldnt it be a great idea to put some sort of crystlal structure with walls entirely surrounding the rocket for future launches it should be far to not be destroyed on launch and high enough to cover all posible trajectories from far away if any time an incident like the one being speculated happens the crystal will be a proof of such event it wont stop the projectile but show what really happened because in this case if it really was a shot they better get some camera from some point of the base with detail because long distance shots cases arent always resolved and shots can be fired even kms away with sniper rifles and such the fact that this rocket was destined to serve facebook also doesnt help to stop this theory
spacex,removed,a tiny drone
spacex,removed,god hates facebook isnt a sufficient answer i guess
spacex,removed,i would be very surprised if even dave would smoke around a fuel stage classic dave
spacex,removed,just wondering if it was a drone would there be any identifiable pieces or would that fireball have incinerated everything if spacex found pieces of drone
spacex,removed,somebody forgot what git branch they were on
spacex,removed,ill just leave this here
spacex,removed,a certain country is posed to lose a lot of money billions if the us continues its launching and manned vehicle progress
spacex,removed,a certain government would benefit from delaying spacex
spacex,removed,very nervously and very lots of extra instrumentation lol
spacex,removed,some crazy holed up in the ksc with a ghillie suit and a good sniper rifle went to college in that area briefly just in my circle i can think of people who would be genuinely capable of executing this including equipment procurement maybe were crazy enough to actually do it but i think they were both spacex fanboys
spacex,removed,micrometeorite
spacex,removed,thank you for answering
spacex,removed,never heard that that stupid teem site gets shit wrong daily looked real to me but i know nothing about meteroritrs￼
spacex,removed,they have firearms s
spacex,removed,ula sniper
spacex,removed,you mean the bullet right
spacex,removed,does that make you batman
spacex,removed,well and i hate to be tinfoilhatty here but hasnt russia spent the last years building up a hightech armory of exotic special forces weapons that dont fit typical characteristics like maybe during the cold war
spacex,removed,keep talking about a gun but what was the high speed object that goes between the towers watch in slow motion youtube
spacex,removed,looks like im off early today
spacex,removed,you post may get banned by the mods just for writing the word shot or bullet or sniper
spacex,removed,theres a buzzfeed article in there somewhere
spacex,removed,begintinfoilhat it might have been someone who hates israel trying to damage the prosperity of an isaeli company endtinfoilhat no way no one in florida hates israel that much
spacex,removed,i hate posting this maybe i shouldnt mods please delete if you see fit with mr musks statements of an outside the rocket source being looked for and the loan sniper gunman questions discussed in other comments and pretty well dismissed is it too soon to ask about sabotage there are a few players in this market that arent looking good from spacexs achievements some with a lot at stake and a lot of resources couldnt there be other ways for an organized group to take down a rocket how big would a device need to be placed on the strong back near the umbilicals would a spark source be enough to ignite the vented lox and what about just a computer hack no site access needed one might be able to cover its tracks okay i hate this post
spacex,removed,cheney was on a hunting trip with this rocket at the time coincidence
spacex,removed,i hope elon planted the idea of a trump space hotel
spacex,removed,trump is funny like that he can also make up as quick as he becomes an enemy just look at megyn kelly
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,ummm ya trump hired him he wouldnt have hired him to ignore him
spacex,removed,as far as politics goes i havent been impressed so far trump beat the republicans the democrats and the dinosaur media to become president and youre not impressed
spacex,removed,you are both delusional if you think a large portion of americans care that much about space and delusional if you think that republicans wouldnt care about space
spacex,removed,imagine a trump hotel in spa where do i sign
spacex,removed,hes unpredictable which scares me but im hopeful
spacex,removed,nah he did it for power the only worse motivation than doing it for money
spacex,removed,i can picture it now have you ever thought of a hotel on mars
spacex,removed,that was a long rant republicans like military the military likes planting poles planets need american flags everyone wins
spacex,removed,im confused why you think hes going to try to make monetary gain off of the presidency hes shown nothing of doing that before or after the election if you have some proof thats fine but dont make things up to suit your own politics
spacex,removed,can you stop copy pasting this post take your outdated information elsewhere
spacex,removed,elon convince trump that he wants to be the potus to land a man on mars he wants a legacy
spacex,removed,really you really believe he wants to turn off existing assets that already have been launched paid for
spacex,removed,seriously the presidential salary is peanuts compared to what he can make on a single deal with a foreign government
spacex,removed,his victory had a lower percentage than romneys loss
spacex,removed,but this is our opportunity to get a kiss from our lord and saviour elon
spacex,removed,damn thiel you beautiful beautiful genius
spacex,removed,ipno
spacex,removed,the guy just because mounted an expedition to recover off the ocean floor wat
spacex,removed,why post stories that only share one sentence before a hard paywall why not mark the thread paywall in the title
spacex,removed,wsj needs to hire some proofreaders are what they need to hire some proofreaders perhaps you should also hire a proofreader
spacex,removed,you truly deserve every single downvote
spacex,removed,thats encouragingexciting
spacex,removed,wow i took a quick look at his post history hopefully hes seeing a professional doctor for his mental problems
spacex,removed,you are living in a dream world
spacex,removed,hypotheticals reddits favorite game
spacex,removed,space force one is my vote it sounds futuristic and just badass enough to use
spacex,removed,just keep tying it back to space what do you thing about a trump space station
spacex,removed,so if you had to spend money to rent a building wouldnt you rather rent a building you owned so as not to waste money especially if you didnt know you would win sound like smart business thinking to me besides now that hes won hes severed all his ties to his business he doesnt own any of it anymore
spacex,removed,you think he talked about climate change with the orange oompa loompa
spacex,removed,i imagine trump would fully supportive especially if the first hotel on mars happened to be a trump hotel
spacex,removed,spacex should just hire the boring company to dig a hole between all their facilities
spacex,removed,he wants this country to be rich right thats why hes widely known for being an excellent employer that pays really well and never defaults on his contractors or gets sued by anyone cough
spacex,removed,my prediction trumps interest in spacex and apple was mostly to do with understanding enemies better spacex and apple both increase the usas insulation from russia so they have to be stopped
spacex,removed,while im no fan of trump i was awed by the operation to get him elected much for my party to learn treason isnt something to emulate and the author of that treason being vladimir putin is why i have serious doubts about the future of spacexs government contracts
spacex,removed,wrong
spacex,removed,and there is that one person with beats headphones ruining the entire video

spacex,removed,its just that people who take fb seriously are usually horrible people there is nothing deeper to it
spacex,removed,the guy is bellyaching because he wants likes on facebook
spacex,removed,im not a facebook user either and for that i am happy for you
spacex,removed,what do you expect from them reading comprehension ad hominem works better if you dont make the same mistakes in your own remarks
spacex,removed,angry woefully misinformed photographer spotted
spacex,removed,ah so in exchange for free subscription you police the fb group so chris bergin can keep his corrupt monopoly brilliant how much are you paid by the way if any of spacex competitors wanted to get info they can either have the forum or buy a subscription
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,apparently it was even leavened into a south africanborn entrepreneur
spacex,removed,awe yeah
spacex,removed,youre assuming no market elasticity spacexs reusability business model is in large part built on the assumption of a flexible market for satellites its like how tesla assumes that more evs from other companies means more profits for them the market for evs is a subset of all cars and more companies building them may mean more ev adoption overall improving their sales and market share of the overall car market even with a decrease in their share of the ev market
spacex,removed,im loving this biggest space dick contest
spacex,removed,i wonder what the motivation for the third stage is delivering amazon orders to the ceres colony
spacex,removed,seems like we got allot of bo fanboys that came here to intentionally start fights with anyone who they dont agree with
spacex,removed,always a solid plan
spacex,removed,well they still have to land it first its not quite the same as new shepherd
spacex,removed,can you point out any rational flaw in this chain of logic sure you speak about future reuse like it already happened in my quarters it is called lie i dont care about your bs percentages reuse is not yet proven period get over it
spacex,removed,hype
spacex,removed,bold statement
spacex,removed,i love this beautiful beautiful man swiping through my reddit and seeing his completely unexcited face made me so excited
spacex,removed,hope so it means someone at spacex actually has some sense
spacex,removed,httpstwittercomjefffoust in media roundtable beauchamp said recent falcon accident wont affect its usaf certification monitoring investigation aiaaspace this message was created by a bot
spacex,removed,its a water skiing analogy for following along s
spacex,removed,i am still shocked about spacex asking the public for any data this shows how clueless they are about the explosion anomaly for fanboys
spacex,removed,but that would mean bill nye was right how can that be he isnt even a real scientist right guys not a real scientist so he cant have the information he said he has right
spacex,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit lars hoffman took one of the landed boosters to mcgregor fired times so far with no refurbishment footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
spacex,removed,ah i love official sauces
spacex,removed,what this really proves is that you knew ahead of time about the explosion after falsely predicting spacex delays you used your magic laser drone to create some and preserve your sites crumbling reputation
spacex,removed,mark gotch was the true hero with his photos also from what chuck yeager said they knew the cause the first day but people wanted to stay in the comfy start hotel so they milked the investigation
spacex,removed,httpstwittercomjefffoust hoffman took one of the falcon landed boosters to texas fired it times so far with no refurbishment aiaaspace httpstwittercomjefffoust hoffman expect to take a couple years to refine the refurb process and costs see significant cost savings in a few years aiaaspace this message was created by a bot
spacex,removed,so is brazil
spacex,removed,ahh now this is podracing
spacex,removed,now this is pod racing grabs coat on the way out
spacex,removed,we should distribute this image somehow
spacex,removed,the fact that someone can in effect tweet out im going to be racing people in pods through vacuum tubes around my rocket factory and not be hallucinating is incredibly amusing to me
spacex,removed,only minutes away from my house
spacex,removed,tunnel boring using giant electric plasma knife
spacex,removed,this guy is just like tony fucking stark well just build a giant arc reactor at our headquarters to show we can do this
spacex,removed,watawatawata i need to go back there to cheer this on
spacex,removed,its like a boy scouts carved car race for rich nerds
spacex,removed,now this is pod racing
spacex,removed,has anyone hear stuff to blow your mind podcast about marrs
spacex,removed,it helps that it is of the size
spacex,removed,i didnt even make the connection until you pointed that out awesome honk honk honk honk honk honk honk
spacex,removed,it seems udrpippin and when the mystery peaked over in rtesla thursday
spacex,removed,i got my money on sebulba
spacex,removed,now this is pod racing
spacex,removed,the leo one is at night
spacex,removed,im impressed that the top comment is not now this is pod racing anyway should be fun
spacex,removed,now this is pod racing
spacex,removed,i say this to my missus all the time
spacex,removed,now this is pod racing
spacex,removed,oooohhhh
spacex,removed,does jedi mind trick you can tell me before the launch date
spacex,removed,elon time this means
spacex,removed,now i really cant wait lol
spacex,removed,didnt you hear stop signs with white borders are optional
spacex,removed,so spacex has built a better mouse trap or in the case a reverse mouse trap
spacex,removed,i cant root for them ever since nixon was involved in the whole waterloop scandal
spacex,removed,yes vertical sorry although that makes my guess make even less sense please forget i was here
spacex,removed,how might you help them speed up their efforts
spacex,removed,how might anyone help them regardless of training could online courses equip people to be productive could tasks be broken down into items that anyone can do with a normal brain and senses
spacex,removed,seal loose rocket watch out for loose rocket
spacex,removed,it was the post red scare yes not getting rid of the commies was a huge mistake at the least there should have been mass treason trials of soviet agents after the collapse of the ussr
spacex,removed,upvoting for the altruism
spacex,removed,d
spacex,removed,so what youre saying is that if there are more launches then there will be more explosions right cool
spacex,removed,as you requested i flipped a coin for you the result was tails for more informationto complain about me see rflipacoinbot
spacex,removed,someone call elon someone stole part of a rocket sarcasm
spacex,removed,maglev in space m around the world in seconds m times m wohoo m im dizzy m blurrgh
spacex,removed,noooooooo theres no stage
spacex,removed,coming into view on port canaveral cam
spacex,removed,elsbeth coming into view on the webcast that shalt be named
spacex,removed,another minute or two and we should see go quest on the webcast that shalt be named
spacex,removed,son
spacex,removed,anyone remember this deep space scene in behind the lines obrien enters with a metre long canister obrien excuse me captain the power cell from the phaser array we used it up on the last mission sisko takes the canister sisko take a good look at this people it says something about this ship it says that we will fight and we will keep on fighting until we cant fight anymore all yes sir sisko you dont just throw something like this away all no sir sisko places it against the bulkhead on some pipework with six other canisters cheers and applause you dont just throw something like this away folks maybe well eventually get a rocket farm in hawthorne
spacex,removed,crush it down compact it then use it as the payload for the fh demo flight
spacex,removed,what if what if we post it to their page then get pissy that they didnt take it down
spacex,removed,that mustang is only a billion times cooler that whatever that is supposed to be
spacex,removed,thanks genius
spacex,removed,nice stang
spacex,removed,may it rest in peace
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,can you imagine how long it would take to smoke the cigar that came in that tube
spacex,removed,murca
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,it gets recycled for those sexy black spacesuits jk
spacex,removed,it hasnt been discharged from service it will remain fueled at all times to serve as elons personal escape vehicle to his secret volcano lair
spacex,removed,rip in pieces
spacex,removed,a fixerupper of a rocket
spacex,removed,so you have to play dumb and nationalistic for the taxpayers sad
spacex,removed,its actually going to be laid horizontally on a ft tall platform
spacex,removed,thatd be hilarious if the stuff in there wasnt even protected or wrapped up as if they just throw everything in theyre like theyre running late trying to catch a flight and rushing to pack a suitcase the mental image of that is hilarious

spacex,removed,we service everything from falcons to dragons special service for merlins now hoping to service raptors in the near future
spacex,removed,that explains everything spacex is growing their rockets in forest they grow from the ground so are bit dirty when ready to be harvested
spacex,removed,thanks for sharing btw anyone else getting a jurassic park vibe with these photos
spacex,removed,im pretty sure that itar contains a special clause in fine print saying above doesnt apply to chris fucking hadfield
spacex,removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
spacex,removed,should i tell him
spacex,removed,youre reading into the report what you want to read rose colored glasses dont suit you
spacex,removed,nsfw
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,this is how we get women interested in space flight
spacex,removed,spacex makers of next gen adult toys ill take one in every model
spacex,removed,trump hoping its not true depression sinks in hope for spacex is something to live for hope fades time will tell
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,i really hope you cleaned the vibrators off before you glued some landing legs on them i know i know low quality comment
spacex,removed,it was simple rud testing
spacex,removed,that was a special moment for all of us
spacex,removed,maybe elon simply decided he wasnt going to give any more chances to bite us
spacex,removed,ive seen the video it did kaboom
spacex,removed,first rocket launch with a happy ending ahem
spacex,removed,orbcomm got a million reduction from its original launch contract to launch between april and june what
spacex,removed,complete with musk making a starkstyle entrance by landing in the middle of a ring of gogo dancers in a dragon
spacex,removed,is it bad that i kinda want to see an explosion this time i miss the awesome explosions a little
spacex,removed,why isnt this in the spacex banner in lieu of the oldancient thiacomm logo
spacex,removed,why the fuck is this campaign here when eutelsat is the current campaign
spacex,removed,just take it apart to get it in there and then blow the dragon apart on arrival
spacex,removed,why hasnt the eutelsat launch superceded the thiacomm media thread in the heading this is unconscionable
spacex,removed,why the fuck is the thiacomm days old media thread more important then the eutelsat thread
spacex,removed,mods are asleep post makes ban
spacex,removed,haha pleb i woke up at am to watch jcsat with school the next day when it landed i was like wha this a dream
spacex,removed,yes that means the booster will land in the middle of the ice field 😜
spacex,removed,it would make a potentially awkward situation when his boss walks in and hears a t count coming from the bathroom stall
spacex,removed,wow those are some big waffles
spacex,removed,youre fighting the good fight here
spacex,removed,but i dontwantthemto kill elon
spacex,removed,the fins are placed in an x wing configuration heh
spacex,removed,spoken like a worthy finland resident
spacex,removed,what is this a gallagher bit
spacex,removed,beautiful
spacex,removed,cant wait to see it with legs attached
spacex,removed,rest in peace
spacex,removed,excellent information thanks
spacex,removed,is he kind of like a sane version of professor farnsworth
spacex,removed,display it right in the middle of the road xd
spacex,removed,buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo
spacex,removed,some of the photos made it look like white chocolate now i really want a chocolate falcon i would pay spacex good money for a falcon chocolate cake mould
spacex,removed,youd get too many calls about an on fire or about to launch rocketicbmdeath missile nutters
spacex,removed,what if they secretly fill it up and light it
spacex,removed,on display yeah right we all know its elons escape pod
spacex,removed,copious amounts of hairspray s
spacex,removed,i see the fins now old eyes i guess you got a mouse to put in that dragon to many gs guess i had always wanted to fly a mouse on an estes big berthia they designed it to carry an egg and it was bigheavy enough to fly slow enough with correct size engine i think so who here will be next to fly mice like spacex
spacex,removed,scale unclear needs banana
spacex,removed,falcon maxxer thurst electric boogaloo
spacex,removed,with a clearly incorrect date or is it dun dun dun
spacex,removed,broken windows melted lawns car alarms triggered every launch sign me up
spacex,removed,nice one that has successfully downraged the grammar nazi in me
spacex,removed,people are awesome
spacex,removed,that pool looks naaaaaaasty
spacex,removed,this is awesome
spacex,removed,this is actually one of the pools to be used in the summer olympics
spacex,removed,ask april ryan about it
spacex,removed,this thing needs a flamethrower
spacex,removed,this is a little ol falco
spacex,removed,youve been res tagged pool guy
spacex,removed,jeff bezos really needs to stop making these small rockets and copying spacex
spacex,removed,id love to see rmichaelbaygifs take a crack at the misses
spacex,removed,i gotta say shes easy on you know thanks for the vid im glad its all nice and cleaned up
spacex,removed,cute
spacex,removed,by looking at the color of water chance an alligator lives there
spacex,removed,i have bad news for you youre colorblind
spacex,removed,tell him to take a pool of the bottle water to a leslies bottle supplies store they do free water tests to tell you what you need to put in your bottle
spacex,removed,well it seemed unlikely but it looks like ill have a rtf on my wedding day
spacex,removed,yes im delighted to admit i was totally wrong phew
spacex,removed,south africa as well please
spacex,removed,yay now i can watch it
spacex,removed,somos legion
spacex,removed,appreciation of history is not a concern we just elected a president who feels the last time america was great was before women had university degrees and we had candidates from both parties saying that the future is just going to be job losses and boredom an appreciation for the future is what we need today if this relic needs to go to pave the way for progress so be it
spacex,removed,this is why i love this subreddit lol
spacex,removed,im thinking theyll just land the second booster on top of the first one and then bring the whole tower in
spacex,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvujpkpdyunng
spacex,removed,cheese itll be cheese
spacex,removed,concrete seems like a terrible material to make a balloon out of
spacex,removed,you can bet of the reason why musk makes this public promise stunts is to build up internal pressure including for himself people underestimate the importance of setting a goal if you want to succeed its tremendously important to have a goal with time line
spacex,removed,seems pretty easy tell the engine to ignite cook stage fly away from boom have engine bell implode go boom oh wait did you want the rocket to survive this
spacex,removed,shit post
spacex,removed,unless the cause had nothing to do with faulty equipment anomaly at this point doesnt rule out the possibility of sabotage on some level there are fewer cameras and people covering the test fire as opposed to the actual launch leaving less chance of being spotted people who might want to cause spacex some grief might include ula spacex is taking food off of their plate a disgruntled former employee or someone that might bear a grudge against elon payload was built by an israeli firm opening up a whole other can of worms and the facebook involvement opens up the possibility of someone wanting to hurt zuckerberg owing to having their life affected negatively online its entirely possible that someone with the proper incentive motivation andor help could have put a bullet or something into the rocket that triggered the explosion might have been someone thats just plain crazy as well
spacex,removed,this failure is a target we should expect better odds
spacex,removed,you are a poopy head
spacex,removed,im sure the engineers at spacex for ignoring a glaring problem or any others has anything to do with a bad attitude ready to launch on time
spacex,removed,that satellite did not cost them to make so spacecom made money on this deal maybe they sabotaged it for the insurance payout
spacex,removed,that satellite didnt cost to make tho so they made money on the incident
spacex,removed,grandpa enjoys telling the story of getting his dick out for ham
spacex,removed,what the hell happened this time by monday
spacex,removed,that doesnt work too well in kerbels they probably wouldnt try it here joke
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,the fact is that we have advanced the state of the art but the physics havent changed and they wont not a believer in emdrive i see
spacex,removed,my intent of posting this was an acceptable standard of service
spacex,removed,im posting this because this is the best place to debunk it article claims the rocket was attacked if this is out of bounds on this thread then mods please delete this post thanks
spacex,removed,my friend found the cause of the explosion from analysing the video
spacex,removed,conspiracy theoy love this one
spacex,removed,you can get infinite energy out of that thingso it can get us pretty much anywhere
spacex,removed,these guys can get fucked they seriously have no idea what theyre talking about
spacex,removed,couldnt they use em drive units to take off
spacex,removed,heavy moderation is what bothers me about this sub
spacex,removed,i would rather see them go bankrupt than to ensure they can to make money with launches so they can continue to do so
spacex,removed,hmm i can see strong water mist on video assume that part of this mist can be precipitated as liquid water on drainage gas pipeline attachment for oxygen when water is frozen by gas flow a tiny amount of pure oxygen can leak via this tiny slot over rocket surface so if trace amount of organic liquid oiletc on surface exist it can be selfignited and
spacex,removed,and now for something completely different its
spacex,removed,those look like tampons
spacex,removed,looks like a clock rocket
spacex,removed,is elons plan to make mars ice caps cum because thats an awfully large vibrator
spacex,removed,watch out man this is a funny post so the mods here will probably delete it
spacex,removed,you are having a bad day and will not go to space today
spacex,removed,you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
spacex,removed,thats fucking amazing
spacex,removed,ok ill say it were sending a dido to mars
spacex,removed,norway
spacex,removed,the person who posted thiss account was created an hour ago id be skeptical of it
spacex,removed,is the tallest building in the bit thats owned by the uk not used as a snipers next during the bad times
spacex,removed,situation normal all fueled up
spacex,removed,this smear piece has me so annoyed right now the targeting of spacex by some of these bloggers is ridiculous take look if you want a good aggravated laugh
spacex,removed,thoughts on vacuum pavlova cookies
spacex,removed,seriously mods go fuck yourself with that high bar
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,side im near gorka can you pick me up joke on neaf
spacex,removed,like storing emails on a server located on a translunar orbit
spacex,removed,starfleet
spacex,removed,the secret is too juicy the number of people who want to spend a ton of money at it
spacex,removed,the different views of the realm of possibility
spacex,removed,im a bot and i would be no humans stressing the life support systems and have a feeling that it would take us decades
spacex,removed,the different views of the space program from the trailer it looks like theyre just going on the ground too
spacex,removed,all those people living in mars and the live feeds are fake
spacex,removed,and when you are down to your socks you know
spacex,removed,zubrin
spacex,removed,elon bring him home
spacex,removed,agreed i was thinking something
spacex,removed,i cant wait until the mct astronauts fight superman
spacex,removed,but then you will always have that reddit username pick hanging over you hehe
spacex,removed,those lander engines look like my nervas from kerbal
spacex,removed,hi your submission was removed from rspacex for breaking our httpwwwredditcomrspacexwikirules submit in a thread if one exists please post simple questions to the ask anything questions thread thanks for understanding this is so we can keep rspacex the very best spacex discussion board on the internet if you feel this removal was made in error please about the removal of my submission
spacex,removed,fml
spacex,removed,this seems to me to be as strong an indication that spacex knows the cause now but there is some reason they should not make the cause public insurers can receive the information with nondisclosure contracts or clauses as can customers it will eventually leak out or secrecy will become irrelevant but i used to live in washington dc and i have seen the force of the government used to keep secret several things that ordinary people like you and i would want to know as news and where making the facts secret seemed to me to be anywhere from pointless to mildly stupid
spacex,removed,for what happened in the last falcon event im going to point out the elephant in the room and im going to say that everyone here suspects sabotage
spacex,removed,would the resulting rocket be too long and wobbly found the ksp player
spacex,removed,i thought we all agreed it wasnt a shooter but jess bezos with a chainsaw
spacex,removed,thats how the elon time works
spacex,removed,unfortunately clinton has zero credibility too many lies along the way but hey at least she isnt actively against it which is an upside i guess
spacex,removed,a goal of my administration will be to expand this knowledge even further and advance our ability to make human exploration of mars a reality what a refreshing point of view from a politician lets contrast this with the views of a leading figure of the national conservative movement i strongly suspect that nasa investments into mars exploration will heavily depend on who wins the election
spacex,removed,im trying desperately to come up with a sauce pun here but im coming up short something with gooses and ganders though probably you get a pass this time echo
spacex,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit a question about fpv quadcopters and amos footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
spacex,removed,can you repeat it one more time by try to sound less like yourself
spacex,removed,too soon
spacex,removed,really surprised to see boca chica mentioned so often here as the launch site its far from any spacex production facility and frankly brownsville wont soon be able to support the sort of workforce that the new production line will need theres a reason musk set up shop in la thats where the aerospace talent is and wants to go vandenberg makes a whole lot more sense its comparatively quite close to the factory in hawthorne and who needs to launch into an equatorial orbit anyway when your destination is mars sure later they may launch from boca when things get cranking but vandy is close at hand and might just host the initial launch series
spacex,removed,ive looked all over the internet i cannot find any spacex instructions telling me what the name of the second barge is
spacex,removed,when you put it like that i completely agree listing them in the webcast is a bad idea but i would still like to honour your plural contribution after all the webcast is probably the single biggest reason well anyway spacex has all the goodwill they do i know you know youre appreciated we tell you often enough but i hope the rest of the webcast team in front of and behind the camera know they are too and if they dont please tell them scene one spacex galactic headquarters hawthorne california usa earth video control room interior day bencredible swivels in a spacexblue office chair he wears a selfsatisfied grin hes just solved the droneship landing video cutout problem but more than that he knows hes appreciated by strangers on the internet he perks up as the webcast production staff begin to file into the room in dribs and drabs he points his fingers pistolstyle at the first person through the door alarming her bencredible hey did you know that youre appreciated by strangers on the internet staffer um i bencredible youre appreciated staffer reacts like hes been caught doing something he wasnt supposed to do staffer quickly takes the opportunity to slink off to her workstation bencredible aaaaaaahppreciated cut to scene two spacex galactic headquarters hawthorne california usa earth gwynne shotwells corner cubicle interior day a line of webcast production staff snakes out of shot foley fx suggest the line is still forming distantly in the background the indistinct voice of bencredible vo can be heard bellowing variations on internet weirdos love you appreciated and so forth looking shaken staffer is nervously addressing gwynne who listens considerately staffer i mean it started kind of sweet or something but its just so rapidfire and it escalated so quickly i mean its kinda freaking me out i didnt think the human throat was capable of some of those sounds and now its not just the av team its everyo elon whats going on gwynne gwynne well bencredible hey elon did you know that people on the internet really love what you do here yeah not sure why i wrote that i may need professional help
spacex,removed,you get the most salty award
spacex,removed,elon lands a falcon in the parking lot
spacex,removed,can elon find a company that can replace ear for mechanical ones i kinda need one
spacex,removed,thats hot
spacex,removed,thats hot
spacex,removed,is this like when the chinese new year celebrations include a line of people parading a cloth dragon through the streets do you think they would appreciate this kind of dragon
spacex,removed,looks like stanford are gearing up to compete with ula as well with that effort im sure ula wont be putting in a tender
spacex,removed,this guy clicks
spacex,removed,this is blatantly not spacex and has been reported but evidently the mods do not agree i guess political statements with no direct relevance to spacex by subject are to be permitted
spacex,removed,yeah anything trumpy should be removed but the post itself showing this nice little project aint a problem
spacex,removed,so stanford is building falcon now
spacex,removed,why are we going to mars lets make an mct do go to the andromeda galaxy
spacex,removed,in that case i propose we build a crane so large that it stills out of the atmosphere and then pull objects up from th wait i just invented the space elevator didnt i p
spacex,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
spacex,removed,doesnt look like itll ever fly again im afraid
spacex,removed,hey elon would finally get his volcano lair
spacex,removed,they should put a big fan in the base and stood it on its end like a flappyman bonus notches if it actually flapped
spacex,removed,spacex so sexy that its easily mistaken for computerized art
spacex,removed,yeah i wish the mods here were more like the mods of rnews s
spacex,removed,i will be in florida for the upcoming launch if i drive down to cape canaveral can i get a great view of the launch
spacex,removed,didnt james dean die in like
spacex,removed,what he said p
spacex,removed,so great
spacex,removed,hmmmm had not seen that post before by none other than echo whose fax machine runneth over rather than scale fh by i am scaling by and get the same number surely we can get an xfiles episode out of this s
spacex,removed,they need to fly that into orbit or a winnebago
spacex,removed,i wonder what the isp of hempseedlox is now
spacex,removed,hot tub
spacex,removed,guys ive got this great idea for a new rocket fuel
spacex,removed,didnt delta iv heavy also launch the orion capsule test flight
spacex,removed,read that as comcast initially cant wait for spacex worldwide coverage
spacex,removed,the first space statue
spacex,removed,big fat rocket
spacex,removed,its pretty cool to have to talk about what to do with all of these returned first stages already
spacex,removed,i love getting rocket updates from james dean
spacex,removed,still too soon
spacex,removed,manned mission to alpha centauri launching over christmas
spacex,removed,maybe its actually a grain silo
spacex,removed,clickbait
spacex,removed,now thats max damage
spacex,removed,rthedonald is leaking
spacex,removed,for some reason i felt like runexpectedfalcon had to be a thing
spacex,removed,should be their new mascot instead of that silly tree
spacex,removed,looks for kid with on his cap it would help if there wasnt this big white drape over half the graduates oh
spacex,removed,yeah that was epic he did not hold back haha
spacex,removed,and in keeping with the culture series naming scheme call it so much for subtlety
spacex,removed,now that is a bent booster bit too hard landing d
spacex,removed,yes i hoped that the macaroni rockets wont appear here any more
spacex,removed,follow elon i dont want to be the creep here but should we really be chasing these waterfalls
spacex,removed,somewhere on craigslist wanted printer for use in methalox rocket engine production
spacex,removed,yeah dark
spacex,removed,anyway my point is not elon
spacex,removed,rocketporn
spacex,removed,surely we can get an auto tweeting static fire sensor iot
spacex,removed,soon the great journey will begin
spacex,removed,no im brian
spacex,removed,just send all our prisoners there to establish the country well call it marstralia
spacex,removed,its a quote from tlcs track of the same name dont go chasing waterfalls please stick to the rivers and the lakes that youre used to i know that youre going to follow elon or nothing at all but i think youre moving too fast
spacex,removed,and its out of the park oh its punctured the protective dome well as the near vacuum of the martian atmosphere sucks the oxygen from our lungs we have just enough time to mention our sponsor marsdogz marsdogz official vat grown hot dog of the mmlb
spacex,removed,perhaps spacex just needs to buy a larger printer generally anything to do with bfrmct were gonna need a bigger printer
spacex,removed,and space is there and we are gonna climb space jfk
spacex,removed,that would be gold
spacex,removed,we need that sweet sweet martian oil
spacex,removed,the first generation will be those who want to be there before the masses arrive somebody need to take a screenshot from the martian where matt has that long viking beard and make meme from it listen son i went to mars before it became cool similar to but theres better frames in the movie unfortunately i dont own the dvd or bluray
spacex,removed,the skies roared and the moon landings kevlar and pretty much all of them are true but none of these issues in an environment such as rfuturology
spacex,removed,i am trying to spoon feed it to you the boca chica launch site is for falcon only until further notice until elon decides to build a bfr launch complex when and where all requirements are met then it will take several years to complete
spacex,removed,i predict that elon will announce at the iac that the will switch to loxmethane in
spacex,removed,if the merlinvac is over powered currently they could just put a raptorvac jr on it thats the same mass but reduced thrust
spacex,removed,im moving across the country from tuesday to thursday personally im expecting chance of a delay into that date range
spacex,removed,i cant unsee that monster can in the hold down pit
spacex,removed,and yet here we are with you commenting about the patch

spacex,removed,no
spacex,removed,comic sans ms
spacex,removed,correct see moon landing coverup
spacex,removed,i may or may not have a secret volcano lair
spacex,removed,how many good posts have you censored on a whim with nothing more than a patronizing automated message live by the mod die by the mod
spacex,removed,i am mostly a lurker here i have noticed echo logic venting in public a lot lately and several times didnt like his public tone taking things way too seriously or complaining a good modding team will essentially be invisible not play the mini celeb card inside their own sub i think he should focus on being a fan again and providing content instead of trying to lord over the sub let more mature people that are suited to admin and teamwork take the lead
spacex,removed,hey thats me
spacex,removed,ok ill start i just went to burning man and it was a river of shit so like will mars be like just shit also i have this electric bus im trying to sell that id like to kiss you in
spacex,removed,if elon brings up his airplane analogy again can we ban him
spacex,removed,so sometime in november of
spacex,removed,i thought he covered that already steal underpants launch satellites send cargo and astronauts to iss kickstarter profit sounds like a plan to me
spacex,removed,or you know just use a laser its lockheed and boeing huge defense contractors that develop all kinds of military hardware the public has no idea exists though i must say that i dont believe ula did anything
spacex,removed,cool but let me know when he does one from mars
spacex,removed,hmmm nah its a darpa program
spacex,removed,well it was an israeli payload i could definitly see some neonazi islamist or even antizionist leftwinger aiming to destroy it would be shocking sad but given the fanatical hatred of israel in these circles absolutly possible
spacex,removed,oh good everyone get your poop questions ready
spacex,removed,the currency will be red credits or redits
spacex,removed,elon is pretty swell
spacex,removed,im gonna ask if i can french kiss him
spacex,removed,unlike the shit storms they have at burning man
spacex,removed,let him mod himself shit the guy could probably write a reddit replacement overnight
spacex,removed,anybody else read this as elon musk will do an ama on mars as in from mars in two weeks i was like well well someone figured out how to bend space and time forgive me im a few whiskeys deep and an idiot
spacex,removed,damn dude will be there in a week didnt think wed get there for at least a few more years
spacex,removed,hey so i was at burning man and i wanna kiss elon mmkay
spacex,removed,he thinks hes going to get to mars in a just a week or two the trip alone takes months
spacex,removed,watch out looks like that last word is missing an oring
spacex,removed,he will be on mars its about time someone made it there people keep talking about it but never do it
spacex,removed,awesome this is my chance to show him my comic
spacex,removed,awww geez
spacex,removed,poop
spacex,removed,nobody mention burning man
spacex,removed,wow i didnt think hed be able to make it to mars this quickly let alone have an internet connection
spacex,removed,holy crap hes already there
spacex,removed,i just had a redditgasm
spacex,removed,this is it boys if we fuck this up we may lose it for humanity
spacex,removed,the thumbnails of these two people look like a dad looking disappointedly down at his son
spacex,removed,youve been randomly selected for a free trip to mars
spacex,removed,he is going to do it on mars how will he get there
spacex,removed,got a bro crush on the mutha fucker yas
spacex,removed,lets just ignore hes going to be on mars in two weeks
spacex,removed,i was really confused for a minute and thought he meant he was going to be on mars i had to check the year real quick because that was a bit fast
spacex,removed,but what if you go to burning man and shit everywhere i mean think about it joking aside cant let that type of stuff happen again
spacex,removed,thought he was gonna be on mars
spacex,removed,lets see if we can top that one convention thing with the stupidest question
spacex,removed,woah woah woah we all need that the first things mars needs is a botanist mars you will come to fear my botany powers
spacex,removed,you know im working on that mars toilet question
spacex,removed,hey we want to know how that space toilet is going to work
spacex,removed,mark watney
spacex,removed,but have you seen my electric bus
spacex,removed,quick ask him the one about the horse and the ducks
spacex,removed,how will he het internet on mars
spacex,removed,yay
spacex,removed,so iss is tons and also happens to have an orbit thats apogee is km im starting to think they were hinting at
spacex,removed,a shit storm like burning man
spacex,removed,might as well theorize it was burning man poo guy or the comic book guy to embrace the crazy for a bit lets imagine the comic was about a guy sabotaging a mars rocket written drawn and given to elon to gloat after the fact in the stunning third act revelation where the culprit tells all
spacex,removed,i didnt think theyd be getting to mars that quickly
spacex,removed,i purpose we have new days on mars when we colonies it so from monsun ill start marsday
spacex,removed,look i intend to get burning man guys space desert sanitation questions answered more thoroughly whether you like it or not
spacex,removed,i wonder if dick rocket will be here
spacex,removed,tinfoil hat time elons actual biggest factory is on mars where he currently lives and will actually do the ama on mars
spacex,removed,it would have been a fluke in a better time in us history but i have a feeling it is not a fluke with todays crappy communist censored media as portrayed in a visit to mexico talk about a combination of crappy conditions
spacex,removed,yes i can finally ask him if i can give him my old tennis racket and kiss his children
spacex,removed,but where will we poo can i kiss you i have an electric bus too i made a comic give it a read through can we send mike cera and the snoo
spacex,removed,but but i want to know about mars toilets and electric buses and heres my comic book and my new youtube mars comedy and wheres my kiss
spacex,removed,password spacetoilet
spacex,removed,well maybe he will surprise us
spacex,removed,but but what will happen to my butt on mars
spacex,removed,great now ill never get the chance to ask elon if i can kiss him at burning man
spacex,removed,the odd shadow and white spot could easily be explained by swamp gases wafting through the frame and the planet venus in the background
spacex,removed,you all seem to think a rifle is the only weapon able to ignite an explosion well boeing is more than familiar with other high tech weapon technologies in fact they build them these are operated remotely and do not leave any traces behind and fully portable too checkmate boeing a tip for the future do not post videos on youtube of you classified sabotage weapons
spacex,removed,i wouldnt write off sabatoge so quickly there are massive incentives from governments space programs and contractors all over the planet to see spacex failula alone is seeing a million a launch drop in revenue most of it gravy and to make matters worse actually has to innovate bezos way more money than musk a more well funded project and blue origion is a yawnfest with nothing but a few test demonstration flights and some jpegs its will destroy every space program as we know it even if it goes no further than ton to leo everyone needs to rethink what they are doing in space
spacex,removed,i dont really want to fan the flames of this hypothesis any more but ill just say that a disgruntled andor crazy person hitting a sensitive point on the vehicle a mile away seems more than implausible
spacex,removed,the elon of mars is the proper title
spacex,removed,but then how will i ask about taking a piss on mars s
spacex,removed,i have a few ideas
spacex,removed,prepare your questions
spacex,removed,can we take a lot at the rscience racism in science circlejerk complete with shadowbanning downvoters and banning those with peer reviewed academic evidence contrary to some of their rhetoric that was a disgusting display of an ama i love elon you probably love elon but not everyone loves elon a lot of people have only seen the failures and not the successes let folks come in here and ask him the hard questions something missing from his poopbased qa session there are folks who have serious doubts about his plan from the radiation to the habitats to the funding to whatever let those folks ask those questions respectfully it shouldnt just be a bunch of fanboys swooning and tossing him softballs there should be serious discussion
spacex,removed,should get a flair biased
spacex,removed,yes
spacex,removed,wow how will he get on mars within weeks amazing
spacex,removed,youre a dumbass
spacex,removed,really thought he was going to be on mars in a week
spacex,removed,wow i read this as he would be on mars answering questions
spacex,removed,httpimgurcomjxgwvwy
spacex,removed,lets not forget spacetoilet
spacex,removed,thanks so much for your answer
spacex,removed,there should be a navigator a cook a doctor a bard a swordsman a mechanic and an archaeologist in every its
spacex,removed,hey elon will you fund my shitty startup
spacex,removed,reddit ama on mars you heard it here first elon to be first man on mars in less than two weeks
spacex,removed,because this entire sub is full of itself its all a pissing contest to see who knows more about rockets the actual employees in the industry arent even as annoying as some of the people here
spacex,removed,noice
spacex,removed,unless mars city needs to fix that segfault in reactor core control software within two minutes or the entire colony will perish in nuclear explosion ooopsss thats just my movie idea
spacex,removed,god i am excited for this iac had me like that jackie chan meme
spacex,removed,i mean ula was created because of industrial sabotage clearly its not passed them
spacex,removed,fast firing dude it blew up
spacex,removed,wow i thought it would take a decade or more to get there
spacex,removed,hey do you want to check out my electric bus
spacex,removed,not even including a disclaimer on conflict of interest because of common corporate owner with blue origin bezos is such a wanker
spacex,removed,the only thing history tells us about lone gunmen is that they tend to conveniently die a mysterious death shortly after having been framed
spacex,removed,can confirm i have come from rall and am trying to make comment long so it wont be removed
spacex,removed,time to reserve some usernamesburningmanpooguy checkkeeseme checkelchaposmafia check
spacex,removed,if its anything less than for each motor i think it would be a waste of all of our time
spacex,removed,dear elon i was at a smoldering male festival a few months ago i was inspired by the event to ask you about toiletry concerns on mars how will spacex solve dedication challenges to ensure the red planet doesnt turn brown
spacex,removed,electric space bus to mars confirmed
spacex,removed,im going to enlist on my side and were going to have a good ol fashion user vs mod battle
spacex,removed,will do an ama on mars
spacex,removed,sorry for the maybe stupid question but as a nonamerican i would really like to know which presidental candidate would be the better choise for space in general i dont mean to shoot to space btw i know there is a lot of controversy around trump because of what or how he says things from time to time but at least from a european perspective it is not all that bad i mean europe has build a wall to keep refugees out
spacex,removed,well i made after elon asked the community to help name these things since hes unsure so i though i would make an illustration a picture is worth a thousand words right its the one thing he asked us to do at the presentation obviously i wasnt allowed to post that on rspacex no reason just no probably because it looks like a meme
spacex,removed,i dont use instagram and i dont know how to transport intervals of time but if i did i would gladly take a second to you there
spacex,removed,umm q why did elons wife file for divorce a he kept saying he needs more space
spacex,removed,how is he going to get to mars in the next few weeks
spacex,removed,moderators hate these tricks find out how
spacex,removed,can someone convert this to elon time
spacex,removed,yes the boeing and lockheed of today are not the companies that made the and the success of the can also be looked at another way that plane and its predecessor never once flew the missions they were specifically designed for overflights of the ussr in part because they were late but also because improvements in air defences were seriously underestimated these days lockheed would be facing a barrage of criticism for their part in creating an expensive late boondoggle
spacex,removed,not even including a disclaimer on conflict of interest because of common corporate owner with blue origin bezos is such a
spacex,removed,wouldnt it make more sense to take the shot from a less visible position like coming in from offshore and firing from near the beach id use a buried rifle with a remote trigger or time delay that had been set up weeks in advance preaimed at the launchpad note to the fbi and others i would not actually do anything of the sort and this post is purely speculation
spacex,removed,no essays
spacex,removed,donald trump hillary clinton and gary johnson have them fight to the death for the only ride home on an already packed mct

spacex,removed,jupiter would like to have a talk with you
spacex,removed,its the trump followers who claim that mars is a scam they do so because they dont want to see it happen it will happen the antispace people planted evidence of a scam
spacex,removed,pack as if you were going to burning man i imagine mars is like living at burning man forever
spacex,removed,something is happening
spacex,removed,building a mars colony sounds a lot like your typical rts game

spacex,removed,elon were gonna need a second hanger alien voice you must construct additional pylons elon damn it
spacex,removed,the scene feels as if its from firstpersonshooting games where you explore an abandoned basespace station and then enemiesaliens pop out of nowhere to kill you
spacex,removed,any system to when the legs are white and black or is the white paint just burnt of during reentry
spacex,removed,everyone please do not vote for trump he would shut down the agency
spacex,removed,hahah best idea ever but i can take the next step just paint an sls on the side of the mtc keep all camaras on that side and tell the congress its a sls going up
spacex,removed,what is sarcasm
spacex,removed,reading this article mad me have a very very scary thought if this violates any of the rules for posts then moderators please delete but the thought was what would the impact be to spacex and all its plans if the russian capsule was docking and then started the uncontrollable spinning and this damaged iss and caused the space station to be abandoned because it is unlivable
spacex,removed,put the cartoons in orbit and now youre effectively using half the bandwidth you are brilliant thought you should know

spacex,removed,hey happy belated birthday the next one is currently scheduled for my birthday
spacex,removed,the wild side of my mind hopes spacex is testing an emdrive and is getting awesome results the mild side of my mind thinks its one of their experimental internet satellites using traditional propulsion techniques
spacex,removed,that shit can barely survives the extremes of cookware
spacex,removed,you need a robot to type for you
spacex,removed,my money is on a kerbal blind passager hitching a ride to orbit who is now playing with his eva jetpack

spacex,removed,haha
spacex,removed,naa we all know uechologic is really elon in disguise
spacex,removed,blood the falcon catched a prey
spacex,removed,i wouldnt be surprised if elon turns out to be that smart ass physics student who invented infinite improbability drive by stirring a hot cup of tea
spacex,removed,oh god i read the title and for a millisecond thought gwynne had some kind of nervous breakdown during the conference
spacex,removed,by contrast spacex has the facilities to manufacture the entire system much more modular and has not yet done
spacex,removed,they need to go kerbal for their next launch

spacex,removed,yes on mars we will create a free expression space where no one is allowed to talk about colonial history only free expression of good ideas

spacex,removed,why is this not on the front page of reddit
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,you would have figured because you dont know any better i would have figured you were a dog pressing random keys based on your comment
spacex,removed,makes you wonder whether this was sabotage by ulanasa
spacex,removed,perhaps it was a conspiracy after all aliens
spacex,removed,so this was rapid unscheduled combustion leading to a rud
spacex,removed,that type of attitude is why this accident happened
spacex,removed,its a good thing that we still have ula sls and blue origin to look forward to in the coming years spacex seems to be losing their edge tbh
spacex,removed,hahaha ula is a lockheed company using year old proven tech china is a country with who knows how much experience with rockets
spacex,removed,i worry for the species can we implement some sort of eugenics program for the mars colony
spacex,removed,lol
spacex,removed,dont be so quick to dismiss those weaponised seagulls with their high powered infrared lasers
spacex,removed,boeing hit the rocket with their airborne laser ok you gotta admit thats pretty funny though
spacex,removed,so either it was the tank it may have been some ignition delay
spacex,removed,i never said second stage lox tank is a failure mode and that comment has nothing to do with this thread why are you even replying to this comment havent you done enough virtue signaling for the day
spacex,removed,yeah it was bezos using one of his amazon drones that killed the rocket good theory
spacex,removed,wingardium leviosa might be helpful too
spacex,removed,too soon
spacex,removed,dick around with the games on your phone
spacex,removed,the lesson here is to hire ula
spacex,removed,what is your agenda
spacex,removed,k just checking
spacex,removed,jesus christ you talk shite listening to people like you we should abandon this doomed blue ball to spend many lifetimes floating about in utilitarian metal boxes how does walking about on barren mars in a spacesuit represent any kind of freedom or prosperity by all means good luck to spacex in its goal of privatising space travel but there is no need for this kind of hyperbole put down the kool aid
spacex,removed,eyed
spacex,removed,well i volunteer you to go first with the telephone sanitizers and hairdressers
spacex,removed,oh come on just build an antimattermatter drive already we want a big boom keep being awesome
spacex,removed,if rocket explode goto runaway
spacex,removed,may i suggest launch learn live
spacex,removed,do you do believe it being israeli satellite satellite pushing internetorg which is brutal may have sabotage involvement i dont know spacex security protocols
spacex,removed,too fast to even watch a movie marketing rep
spacex,removed,stop talking and browsing reddit and get back to work
spacex,removed,its been one day
spacex,removed,i just want to kickstarter a rocket
spacex,removed,thats just elon saying its just a flesh wound
spacex,removed,morons have an incredibly hard time keeping their mouth shut about things they know nothing about
spacex,removed,we all know that tory bruno was sitting somewhere in the bushes with a highpowered laser no need to hide it
spacex,removed,massive
spacex,removed,you cant mods will shut it down for many reasons just like saying the huge ammount of problems and obvious reasons why it is impossible to go colonize mars in the time spacex is promissing even considering elongated time if you speculate things for good everyone aplauds if you try to be the ciniccetic guy with feet on ground you are out
spacex,removed,this would have looked more awesome with a herd of cows running around in the foreground p

spacex,removed,without needing hypothetical nefarious airlaunched pigeon laser projectiles could this false flag operation be anymore obvious the mods are trying to suppress the truth wake up sheeple
spacex,removed,i did a frame by frame analysis of the video and think that there is something weird going on here not only does an object fly right at the rocket before it blows up but another one flies past it and behind it during the first second of the explosion could very well be a couple of well timed and placed bugs but what if it is not you can see my video analysis here

spacex,removed,finally elon shows up
spacex,removed,haha
spacex,removed,the super dracos are multiply redundant one reason that liquid fueled boosters are so much safer than solids is that they dont tend to fail with nearly the explosive force shrapnel events likely did occur but not within a second of the failure there would seem to be a rather straightforward methods to mitigate such risks a large thin collar attached to the strongback that could be split apart and retracted immediately prior to launch would seem likely to prevent most shrapnel from reaching the capsule
spacex,removed,those rickets
spacex,removed,i thought we were summoning elon for a second
spacex,removed,to infinity and beyond
spacex,removed,ill test automod code here to see if itll pick up on words that we didnt expect hell find
spacex,removed,i have a feeling something went wrong inside the stage it looks a little more like a directional detonation of the second stage rather than an asorolised explosion of course the ejection of fuel and lox could have been so fast that the first frame we get is of the explosion i think its super hard to say where it came from with just one angle i imagine space x with thier multiple angles probably have a rough idea of where it came from
spacex,removed,what month are you in the fire fighters of cape canaveral air force station calendar
spacex,removed,wow thats a cunty article
spacex,removed,you may like ten times carl sagan blew our minds
spacex,removed,whoever wrote this is kinda dumb no offense
spacex,removed,out of curiosity how far is the swamp from the rocket i cant imagine any one hiting that shot with a supressed rifle from above
spacex,removed,this is good
spacex,removed,what do you mean we arent going to use the tank connection gaskets ive been designing and building for years this is an outrage rabble rabble this is how i see nasa now
spacex,removed,til
spacex,removed,same i want to marry that girl now
spacex,removed,dont know why youre getting downvoted i chuckled too thats a big fucking drive
spacex,removed,so you get all famous and think youre the only photographer in this town jk haha
spacex,removed,baby got boostback
spacex,removed,mmmmmmmmmmhmmmmm thats some gooood burnin right there
spacex,removed,damn i was nearby too
spacex,removed,maybe new on iridium next next d
spacex,removed,sounds like there should be an idiom for that a spare in the air is worth three in the storage facility has a nice ring to it p
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,amazing i hope you guys can pass the safety and run the tube sometime soon
spacex,removed,accuracy doesnt really matter tbh not like were talking about rocket science
spacex,removed,king
spacex,removed,the energy required to move that air would be astronomical chess should be a required class thinking at least two moves ahead is a lost art
spacex,removed,cool a satellite with my name is going to space
spacex,removed,finally this is going to be amazing
spacex,removed,one step closer to reuse
spacex,removed,more to go and this one will be back in the sky
spacex,removed,certified preowned
spacex,removed,youre right it was the aliens we discovered on the moon
spacex,removed,im in the mood for bbq
spacex,removed,wat
spacex,removed,looks gold to mes
spacex,removed,do you do anything other than stare at this subreddit refreshing for new urls
spacex,removed,those tests would be consistent with the interstage explains the abnormal darkness example
spacex,removed,it wouldnt be the first time
spacex,removed,this looks like a civilization screenshot gotta go for the science victory of course
spacex,removed,engineering today is so different and rockets are not even close to the idea that slightly used is more reliable is a community product of rspacex implemented by request
spacex,removed,does he regret talking that much trash to jordan during the finals
spacex,removed,we shouldnt bother testing them problems only occur times
spacex,removed,im the fucking man what hes thinking in this picture
spacex,removed,what a lie thats too beautiful of a capsule this is elon on the set of the new star trek film
spacex,removed,come on kids i know where we can play
spacex,removed,i agree especially because its a photoshoot you would expect it to not make him look like a robot unless he really is a robot
spacex,removed,what i wouldnt do to just sit in there for a couple minutes
spacex,removed,this is his android double no getting past you cardboardboxprocessr and unfortunately for you that is this is why you must be silenced
spacex,removed,nah thats just the seating for elon class business class economy class and cattle class p
spacex,removed,its the space travel we deserve
spacex,removed,maybe this is the new interior to the model
spacex,removed,hmm needs some wooden arm rests
spacex,removed,firefly and who exactly is going to complain about that
spacex,removed,he has that peaceful look on his face like his visualizing something visionaries gonna visualize
spacex,removed,elon just casually planning his escape
spacex,removed,no wide like your mother
spacex,removed,godamn africans taking over space
spacex,removed,casually it was a photo op
spacex,removed,i want this man to make me a baby
spacex,removed,totally tesla
spacex,removed,but what is the obvious comment
spacex,removed,like imagining he is a kerbal
spacex,removed,elon just casually checking out posing for a photo shoot in dragon
spacex,removed,elon musk will make anime real
spacex,removed,ok systems check out lets take this thing for a quick trip around the planet
spacex,removed,dude if id be him id sleep in that thing regularly
spacex,removed,yup this is my spaceship
spacex,removed,the real question is when can i buy one of these suits to go snowboarding
spacex,removed,shiny
spacex,removed,depends on which side you lived on the alliance were definitely the good guys live on the core worlds and you will have a pretty good life
spacex,removed,vogue are used to dealing with people from outer space
spacex,removed,nonsense mockup
spacex,removed,look at the billionaires shoes down to earth
spacex,removed,hes a big guy
spacex,removed,he is involuntarily shedding his human suit since he knows he is close to getting back home
spacex,removed,dear mr musk you will go down in history as an american hero that being said you own a spaceship man why havent you been to space yet sincerely uvacws
spacex,removed,sat through that entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father
spacex,removed,the design has a very mass effect feel to it
spacex,removed,fox do a barrel photo
spacex,removed,orbital segment rip brave cosmonaut death to the space leeches
spacex,removed,damn near killed em
spacex,removed,i feel the same about whether god exists or not
spacex,removed,you guys are so pathetic now you have no idea no i am right no i am nooo yes jesus christ grow up
spacex,removed,everything about this photo is right
spacex,removed,this looks like something out of a bond movie
spacex,removed,definitely read elton
spacex,removed,what a horrible analogy that book was utter crap you have to have quite an imagination to try and fit it to this scenario of course the books get it all wrong too so misappropriating it would make sense in a warped way
spacex,removed,ive seen the man who fell to earth i know whats up elon just wants to go home
spacex,removed,it would have been a minor annoyance at most then you dont have true ocd and your prior comment simply trivializes a debilitating disease that some people struggle with all their lives
spacex,removed,id love to see the pictures in his head at that moment or at any moment really
spacex,removed,the stare of self actualization
spacex,removed,this submission has been randomly featured in rserendipity a botdriven subreddit discovery engine more here
spacex,removed,spacexs stage dwarfed blue origins suborbital vehicle returned from a far greater downrange distance and velocity and is of greater nearterm moment for lowering the cost of space activities it was also second join the club tweeted the combative founder of blue origin jeff bezos to spacexs elon musk that burn was so harsh i think you deorbited
spacex,removed,rtheexpanse is leaking dmitri to inyalowda
spacex,removed,damn that cracked me up
spacex,removed,until then curiosity will be hunting you lol
spacex,removed,except billion p
spacex,removed,i am educated enough to make rough estimates and the results i do not like
spacex,removed,thanks to kerbal space program i can imagine
spacex,removed,yeah we dont really have an inspections or anything we just kinda take space travel and wing it ya know i mean why the hell not
spacex,removed,i can hear the distant crumple of tinfoil as i type this
spacex,removed,whether or not the launch system was hacked i think that any model that includes sabotage would necessarily include hacking if only to hack the schedules the technical specs the details of the launch site etc i think its wise to consider the list of possible saboteurs especially foreign governments who were opposed to deploying the payload that spacex was carrying
spacex,removed,we need to start putting some memes together or prank phone calling companies around hawthorne something to add some life to this sub i swear the front page hasnt changed in days
spacex,removed,on topic of sabotage even now the tech is probably here to make a drone that can fly to the rocket autonomusly attach itself to the outside of the common bulkhead then use somesort of explosive list is getting longer
spacex,removed,wouldnt surprise me if the mods deleting all the failure cause related comments and handing out bans when people asked about it wasnt part of the reason also just slow id guess
spacex,removed,they should recruit alaskans
spacex,removed,of course it will happen is musk material hat trick double xp go mars go
spacex,removed,theyre going to make the air force pay for it sorry
spacex,removed,finally he will have his evil genius island all he needs now is a volcano
spacex,removed,now im sad again
spacex,removed,despite a recent explosion during testing for the mission musk will provide details on the muchanticipated mars colonial transporter project please tell me this is true if it is hype
spacex,removed,haters gonna hate you cant listen to naysayers while you are trying to do something doesnt really matter what people say it wont stop elon
spacex,removed,so you think the ruskies are behind the rud
spacex,removed,kids these days p
spacex,removed,or mk ii full thrust if they get elon to help name it it could be the ft even fuller thrust edition
spacex,removed,are are those dimensions in inches cringe
spacex,removed,that is cargo dragon correct it is suppose to carry cargo correct this is a your maiden dragon flight correct do you have a hatch on that capsule and a floor well where is your tiny wheel of cheese just not right to fly a maiden dragon flight without a wheel of cheese
spacex,removed,the mct will have a conical shape fly solo not tethered to another and the first one will have a cowboy mannequin inside
spacex,removed,its so close im so excited

spacex,removed,but can it land just kidding looks fantastic man
spacex,removed,they are missing something no big painted x under the rocket
spacex,removed,glorious
spacex,removed,i cant wait for it to be a pokemon go gym plz team rocket
spacex,removed,its fine just slap more bfrs on it and a few struts
spacex,removed,facon nien
spacex,removed,i dont want to alarm anyone but in the second to last image it appears you have shrunkwrapped a blonde guy in a black tank top to the rocket his one arm is free and hes reaching out but the below the waist he appears stuck
spacex,removed,triggered
spacex,removed,gotta love some titles gaze in awe at elon musks historic erection
spacex,removed,i feel like theres a ksp joke to be made here but i dont know what it is
spacex,removed,whaddya got in that capsule there mate ah you know just a buncha different science thats all some small sciences some big ones mostly used up science though thats why were sending it back
spacex,removed,heard about a sale on some science over on the other side of town might want to stop in at the science shop and check
spacex,removed,he should have hired staples for an afternoon concert with appropriate band and various performers dancing model
spacex,removed,how much science about a thousand
spacex,removed,what do you do for a living im a bagger oh at a grocery store no rocket engines
spacex,removed,eh i wish it was a sniper
spacex,removed,hyper loop is bogus
spacex,removed,tldr
spacex,removed,that makes sense or maybe its propaganda
spacex,removed,i dont know other words come to mind propane proprietary proposition propagation propaganda
spacex,removed,what would an immarsat costume look like though
spacex,removed,do they lease maxi pads
spacex,removed,therell be an investigation itll be huuugeee
spacex,removed,can septa guarantee i wont die on one of their busses can boeing guarantee i wont die in one of their airplanes why does anyone act like spacex needs to be safe when nasa got of their own astronauts killed why dont we make the safety standard dont be as dangerous and foolhardy as nasa
spacex,removed,need another birdie for that info also calm down varys
spacex,removed,upvoted for poorly written nonsense
spacex,removed,of course thats not true
spacex,removed,shit
spacex,removed,theyd die
spacex,removed,httpstwittercommurphypak nasaspaceflight lmao 😂 wish it was here this message was created by a bot
spacex,removed,exciting
spacex,removed,should be banned in this thread dont scare me like that plus bad vibes
spacex,removed,huzzah
spacex,removed,unless you think that the first day of the week is sunday
spacex,removed,knowing elon he speaks strictly in format no exceptions
spacex,removed,isnt that the holiday when you celebrate all the years landed boosters
spacex,removed,im gonna need a source on monday being next week
spacex,removed,do you go to cp
spacex,removed,monument with less road miles
spacex,removed,and as ronda rousey proved last friday you can only take so many hits to the eye before youre out of the picture for good didnt think a phrase like this would ever pop up on this subreddit
spacex,removed,they could always just fly the stage over to the east coast
spacex,removed,betterthanamos
spacex,removed,official times
spacex,removed,whats a launch thread s
spacex,removed,new launch thread procedures to maintain karma temperatures thread is started as late as possible to actual launch time
spacex,removed,im sitting here rocking on my butt clutching my knees this may get tiring by next week
spacex,removed,high school student here itll be pm here on the east coast really wish i could watch it but i have english and latin those periods we get to do our own private work in english though so ill try to check in if i can lol
spacex,removed,why do we fall bruce
spacex,removed,meta
spacex,removed,what is the mods stance on pescepescetarianism
spacex,removed,and no weird anthropomorphism theres subs for that why did this summon the concept of spacex rule into my brain whyyyyyyy
spacex,removed,hey ill anthropmorphitize whatever the hell i want too its a free country mods cant tell me who or what i cant love this is america
spacex,removed,rua rapidly unscheduled assembly
spacex,removed,and no weird anthropomorphism theres subs for that i thought that was rule
spacex,removed,sleeper service for the mct proper though
spacex,removed,unless youre talking about boatsships no objectifying people when will the suppression of spacex boats end its only their buoyancy against long tall things repeatedly smashing into them that keeps them afloat drift free boats dont be a mindless drone boatlivesmatter s
spacex,removed,pescepescetarian one who solely eats fish who eat other fish
spacex,removed,so sad
spacex,removed,too many neckbeards in reddit
spacex,removed,word
spacex,removed,bad call mods this can totally be handled with downvotes
spacex,removed,exactly
spacex,removed,this is an online anonymous environment and spacex is all about pushing the conventional approach into the trashcan fuck this pc mod move i love my sexy ass rocket
spacex,removed,was it john i bet it was john cut em some slack weve all missed him
spacex,removed,my sarcastometer is picking up a reading here guys
spacex,removed,♪ why you have to be so rud ♫
spacex,removed,you rebel you
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,the rocket already tried that first
spacex,removed,hope you dont get banned for saying insprucker
spacex,removed,rud speak sense man was there an alien on board yes
spacex,removed,implying is bad you best be joking
spacex,removed,see how far that attitude gets you professionally sure you have the right to offend whoever the hell you want but why take such pride in being an asshole and dont come back with oh its for the principles of it all go express your joy of being a jackass somewhere else while we talk about rockets here
spacex,removed,i think the muscular guy with the beard is easy on the eyes do i deserve a ban
spacex,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°╯╲卐卐卐卐 dont mind me just taking my mods for a walk s of course
spacex,removed,what a great idea for a social network only smoke signals allowed maximum of puffs
spacex,removed,you dont have your own satellite next youll be telling me youre the kind of pleb who doesnt even own a private jet
spacex,removed,man that looks like its straight out of interstellar
spacex,removed,this new rule is sexy
spacex,removed,so much room for activities
spacex,removed,we still have to wear pants with belts and polo shirts in space damn i want the jetsons hats
spacex,removed,so all you said was shes nice on the eyes seriously its a big deal that he found her attractive i guess witch hunts make you sjws feel better
spacex,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsxqkxxbqju treat the sub as if its your workplace but it isnt anyones workplace and thats the beauty of it its a subreddit its the modern equivalent of a pubic square whats the big deal with people saying stuff theres nothing wrong with finding someone attractive nor is that sexual harassment youve turned the most benin things into sexual harrasment im not even someone this rule would effect but its just absurd its the modern day equivalent of witch hunts you police everyones ideas and socially outcast anyone the mobs think are unjust grow some thicker skin you babies and leave people alone you guys will probably use the caps to delete my comments saying it was offensive or some shit oh no i said shit am i fired you cannot sexually harass with little comments on the internet
spacex,removed,soyoure saying its bigger on the inside d
spacex,removed,for interstellar reference
spacex,removed,i am offended by your usage of profanity i am reporting you to hr as this is a workplace apparently
spacex,removed,common stereotype africans are notoriously bad with time
spacex,removed,once those are used id still love one named it worked on ksp
spacex,removed,i thought rule was be attractive rule dont be unattractive s
spacex,removed,yea why your a dick and cant deal with some light hearted humor
spacex,removed,i think men who work in technology related fields like many of those who follow spacex have a tendancy to be social justice warriors because they werent properly exposed to experiences like contact sports or the military therefore they do not understand or find themselves without the courage to stand up to the strange forces that are attacking our people and way of life in western countries today you should consider identifying your problem and changing your attitude if you identify as an sjw because everything that is good and normal is under attack and youre part of the problem
spacex,removed,yep spacex mods are so good that i am sure they can easily remove all trolls from the internet i for one am shocked that the internet contains sexist people or comments rude comments are called rude for a reason but seriously good luck policing the internet all the best with your god complex and an open forum heres to trying though
spacex,removed,this seems like an easy question to answer they blow up sometimes
spacex,removed,pee on your clothes to make them a little heavier
spacex,removed,if you cant be part of discussion because you cant handle someone pointing out soneone elses attractiveness i dont think youre old enough to have an opinion about space flight
spacex,removed,we brake for nobody
spacex,removed,your onomatopoeia is on point
spacex,removed,real hackers own their own trebuchet
spacex,removed,thank you
spacex,removed,thought this was the kerbal space program sub and said to myself wow these mods really are realistic i need to sleep
spacex,removed,dear spacex please dont blow this one up sincerely nasa
spacex,removed,from this moment on i have moved to the camp that hates the fb pages on spx tm and em
spacex,removed,not necessarily spacex but certainly related funny stuff please delete if inappropriate
spacex,removed,p
spacex,removed,when it absolutely positively has to be delivered by tomorrow morning
spacex,removed,remind me one week
spacex,removed,it has been more than a decade since it has had new episodes plus it has been on netflix for a few years so if you have not watched it by now it is your own fault
spacex,removed,just because you think its crap doesnt mean its crap
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,id kick everyone out so i could jerk off in there
spacex,removed,thanks for the new desktop background
spacex,removed,holy crap this looks so futuristic like a spaceship
spacex,removed,epic firefly quote this is the captain we have a little problem with our entry sequence so we may experience some slight turbulence and then explode
spacex,removed,only kids will remember
spacex,removed,musk daddy
spacex,removed,shower thought with falcon heavys booster and core stages being planned to land back at ksc last i knew of may have changed would it not be more advantageous to have the core stage land on of course i still love you or just read the instructions i would think that that would be preferred so as to minimize the deltav that would have to be reserved for the boostback burn or would the added difficulty and other factors such as weather in the asds location and so on make it not worth the savings
spacex,removed,i wonder what his dreams are like
spacex,removed,new wallpaper thanks
spacex,removed,i guess about science
spacex,removed,where is the head
spacex,removed,quick get john boon to help us
spacex,removed,special tier for amputees send your leg to mars and be the first to set foot on the red planet limit quantity
spacex,removed,yeah fuck them engineers s
spacex,removed,makes me think of the opening of every monty python episode
spacex,removed,you misunderstood my point try again
spacex,removed,reminds of god saying i am to moses whats that a bird a plane a spaceship i is
spacex,removed,i stand corrected said the man with orthopaedic shoes
spacex,removed,it blew my mind when people would say nes instead of nes when it came to the nintendo entertainment system
spacex,removed,interesting thank you for your comment made things a lot clearer for me do you think that something like the its could be paired up with something like the warp drive in the future im not even sure the warp drive is something that is possible because i really have never seen it tested even on a small scale ive only heard about it here and there
spacex,removed,hey now ceos are paid like as much as their peons because they literally do the work of people seriously have you ever even tried taking that much credit its a lot of work
spacex,removed,the ship could drop out of orbit to do a suborbital rendezvous with the dragon pick it up then burn back into an orbital trajectory it works in kerbal space program
spacex,removed,i think hes already there
spacex,removed,or a convenient plot device like à la murder in the orient express train goes into a tunnel swish boom bang unf swoosh comes out of a tunnel someones dead mars comes out from behind the sun contact cannot be reestablished takes a scrappy group of astronauts on a mission to mars to find out what happened dun dun duuun
spacex,removed,youd think general system vehicle
spacex,removed,we better be careful about any return missions from venus then
spacex,removed,lets call it sfe souvenirs from earth
spacex,removed,how else would it be a clickbait headline clickety clikclik
spacex,removed,climate zones will shift plants will grow in different areas its already happening some serious problems will arise as migration of plants is slow some plant species might die others will take their place
spacex,removed,im saying your post which makes factual statements is probably wrong or at least a massive simplification of a complex topic to the point of me wondering why you even bothered to say it seriously a simplification of a very complex situation in a reddit post surprises you now i am seriously surprised
spacex,removed,but is it cancerous outside of california
spacex,removed,i see a lot of criticism of musk on things like his worklife balance his lack of time he spends with his family his large number of divorces etc but personally i think the human exploration of space is more important than any number of broken families so i honestly couldnt care less how shit his personal life is its none of my business in the first place anyway
spacex,removed,have a strange gut feeling that the root cause was well known from the very beginning it is just kept undisclosed may be for a good reason
spacex,removed,goddamn kids these days
spacex,removed,orbital facility clearly we just strap an its to the iss and push it to venus muskproval of name pending
spacex,removed,eyy thats pretty cool
spacex,removed,yes d now i dont feel as bad about rejecting the scholarship that wouldve enabled me to see it in person d
spacex,removed,landscape o
spacex,removed,they might mandate portrait mode
spacex,removed,come on now one pad is already charred and unusable dont need another on the west coast in same shape
spacex,removed,not planet express
spacex,removed,im moving in to mcdonalds to use their wifi
spacex,removed,now itll be renamed to a symbol so everyone will have to call it the spacecraft formerly known as the interplanetary transport system
spacex,removed,that is the orbit where it delivered the sat and then powered down the satellite did the rest changed the inclination to and then lowered the orbit to geo uses less propellant to do the inclination change at altitude
spacex,removed,please record it and upload it for later im going on a transatlantic flight on that day and a recording of the presentation would be wonderful
spacex,removed,you are basically mark watney
spacex,removed,a fast ship fast enough to do the kessel run in under parsecs
spacex,removed,more efficient use of resources by not throwing tonnes of aluminum and other metals away into the ocean every time we launch a satellite a great deal of environmentalists coughjillsteincough would prefer we didnt launch satellites or use technology at all
spacex,removed,i just got the biggest boner for humanity
spacex,removed,watching elon musk unveil the future of humanity priceless
spacex,removed,i dont see why sponsorship wouldnt be a good thingthe extra money would be put to good use and the mainstream advertising would enhance peoples interest including those who arent necessarily in to it already
spacex,removed,that is very false everything is relative
spacex,removed,the space shuttle was sts not sls as for naming of the bfs its we know that the first bfs sent to mars will be named heart of gold after the spacecraft from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
spacex,removed,i cant easilyi dont have the knowledge
spacex,removed,theres something kinda poetic about that
spacex,removed,the falcon heavy is falcon put together using firststage cores as boosters with a normal second stage could spacex make a falcon superheavy by mating falcon heavies together assuming a similar increase in performance it would have a performance characteristic directly in between the fh and the bfrmct but would be more adaptable for nonmartian missions costwise though i am unsure how expensive it would be compared to the bfrmct however it would have the advantage of using firststage boosters which should become theoretically the cheapest arm of the spacex launch family
spacex,removed,boeing please dont fly a in the area of this launch and please done fly an unmanned airplane into it in all seriousness that is really funny that they thought boeing had something to do with it
spacex,removed,youre just saying that because you are a boing spy admit it
spacex,removed,boeing shot it down with one of s
spacex,removed,while i agree that my and posts are probably not adding much to the discussionand maybe should be gotten rid of on those grounds its not like us saying one thing or another is going to actually affect the schedule were just excited to watch the launch and were posting in a thread that says the launch date may get moved to a day we can watch it
spacex,removed,it doesnt mean what you think it does you gotta admit it sounds like one of those magic bracelets that infomercials market to old people for their arthritis buy your empower now and well throw in a free bottle of herbal magic vitamins
spacex,removed,is it wrong that i thought this meant touchdown
spacex,removed,is spacexstats down for anyone else did echo forget to pay for the domain this month p
spacex,removed,i just realized that elon musks inexorable volcano lair might actually be inside the largest volcano in the solar system olympus mons
spacex,removed,this is where old falcons first stages go to die having pods shoved through their guts at
spacex,removed,its an intern projecti made that up but not really
spacex,removed,well i should have said most likely because there isnt really a source it very well could be however engine because of the mass of the payload theyre lifting was kilograms and used engine isnt known but i believe had less things on the sat not sure dont quote me on that one will be kilograms usircoolbo
spacex,removed,well fuck
spacex,removed,good morning elon sun is shining birds are singing and youve lost a rocket today have a good one
spacex,removed,f
spacex,removed,apparently upgrade gone horribly wrong
spacex,removed,is elon ok
spacex,removed,but but but spacex is supposed to be better
spacex,removed,we get it bro you vape
spacex,removed,oh no elon why do u keep blowin up ur spaceships
spacex,removed,bet your friends name is dan
spacex,removed,hopefully if this is a fire there is a community product of rspacex implemented by request
spacex,removed,nooooooo i cant believe this is happening today is april right
spacex,removed,the explosion was probably very bright initially at least we got that goin for us which is nice
spacex,removed,including the gas pump attendant
spacex,removed,random speculation time what if the hold down clamps didnt work rocket lifted off and they had to do the launch abort
spacex,removed,titusville snigger
spacex,removed,very fitting that the sidebar is advertising size does matter rsamplesize
spacex,removed,this one deserves the name of just testing posthumously
spacex,removed,comments on cnn joshua c duplantis there goes your taxes money to give every person in the states a nice meal what a fucking dumbass
spacex,removed,oh bullshit space is hard innovation sucks sometimes
spacex,removed,well i think its safe to say israelies and space dont mix well together
spacex,removed,nooooooo
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,the gfe dun goofed
spacex,removed,something unexpectedly different happened
spacex,removed,sourced from echos fax machine
spacex,removed,i feel like ula did this idk why
spacex,removed,the first employee to use the e word will be sent on a media training course in sibera
spacex,removed,it went full kerbal never go full kerbal
spacex,removed,conspiracy they didnt want to be sold after successful launch of the satellite that has been grounded for years
spacex,removed,how much bezos should be more involved here
spacex,removed,plz no i am too hyped
spacex,removed,im trying to restrain myself from suspecting foul play persia perhaps russia unlikely but one wonders
spacex,removed,rest in peace you were taken from us too soon
spacex,removed,was this one of the recovered rocket
spacex,removed,i think that is was satellites that caused explosion biggest strongback damage is right where satellite was minutes where is experienced rud satellite begins to switch to internal power maybe there were some problems with it explosion it is used in satellite as its fuel
spacex,removed,payload is kil
spacex,removed,oy vey shut it down
spacex,removed,i guess silver lining is that it was a pad issue and not falcon
spacex,removed,i really hope this was the payloads fault and not spacex
spacex,removed,first of all did you not read the other comments that said the same stupid thing second did you not see my edit where i specifically stated in not talking about the main engines
spacex,removed,shit happens
spacex,removed,one has to start wondering if this was sabotage tinfoilhat
spacex,removed,interns probably
spacex,removed,living up to its name i see
spacex,removed,hahahahaha fuck
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,for fucks sake this sucks major balls
spacex,removed,you should be used to that captain obvious
spacex,removed,so is this the reused rocket they are launching or a new one i know that they were supposedly launching one of the re used rocket soon but not sure when
spacex,removed,and rockets cannot be reused anyways
spacex,removed,a spacex falcon rocket just exploded at cape canaveral nooooo destroying facebooks internetorg satellite yaaaaaaaaay
spacex,removed,yes thankfully the facebook internetorg satellite was destroyed spacex suffered a loss today but httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternetorgnetneutralityprinciples was handed a huge victory
spacex,removed,if we blow up your satellite the next one is free
spacex,removed,piggybacking off my earlier comment while we cant confirm what it was im just going to predict its some sort of ft fueling problem or a satellite problem
spacex,removed,what are the odds of them being able to pull one of the flightproven boosters out of storage to replace the vehicle they just lost obviously this would be done once the investigation is completed
spacex,removed,seriously he got downvoted just for asking a question pieces of shit
spacex,removed,not really happy cakeday
spacex,removed,sabotage of the gse eg someone shooting the equipment with a rifle from long distance would be the best case scenario
spacex,removed,i knew this was going to happen fucking xspace
spacex,removed,is that really a hyperloop project sitting on the street outside spacex hq
spacex,removed,ground fuel is supplied by nasa if i recall maybe those guys slacked off on general maintenance
spacex,removed,there hasnt been a catastrophic launch pad explosion since the early rocket development before manned launches this explosion on a firing is a massive set back tesla stock is already starting to nose dive today musk is like an upside down pyramid with huge amounts of debt based on stock value to finance the investment where no profit is expected for years the whole strength of spacex was to make space flight more routine sudden unexpected explosions arent routine
spacex,removed,someone in rspace just posted video of the initial explosion httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvohetnttzpe
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,they should know better to launch from somewhere that can be targeted easily by lms laser the barge was a better idea
spacex,removed,malaria or rocket explosions the guy cant take a break
spacex,removed,sell em to another rail network
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,bucks says it involves some kind of valve
spacex,removed,wwvbd what would von braun do thats awesome
spacex,removed,thinking of you spacex
spacex,removed,its all your dream and you are about to wake up to a full intact rocket
spacex,removed,i am saddened to hear that space has xploded we will just have to study the earth from now on you know that technically we are all orbiting the erths core so we are all earthtronauts the more you know
spacex,removed,terrorist group managed to plant a bomb inside an israeli satellite during manufacture it becomes a security issue well outside of the us and not related to the hardware and other systems
spacex,removed,i am sure there are those at bo and ula are sort of internally overjoyed but theyd never express it
spacex,removed,aliens got it
spacex,removed,sabotage oh well i guess thats hardly best case
spacex,removed,im press hi press im dad sorry if that joke didnt impress you much
spacex,removed,meanwhile cnn says trump and biden making speeches in ohio is breaking news not even on the crawl
spacex,removed,why is gon from tekken in the clouds
spacex,removed,they upgraded the wrong launch site
spacex,removed,really sick of folks too cheap to pay for a product key
spacex,removed,good fuck spacex
spacex,removed,lol cuckerberg no more racist africa internet satellite for you
spacex,removed,north korea aint looking so bad now
spacex,removed,lol cuckerberg no racist africa satelite for youuu
spacex,removed,but it was a facebook satelite fuck em
spacex,removed,well now its clear who to blame zuckerberg and his evil internetorg initiative
spacex,removed,can wesh news in orlando use as well
spacex,removed,i hope this isnt the end of spacex but if nasa cancels commercial crew it could be
spacex,removed,maybe were seeing where they have finally bitten off more than they can chew
spacex,removed,has anyone tried to contact with them mikewagneruslaunchreportcom
spacex,removed,didnt mean for it to blow up heh
spacex,removed,cnn here can we use the picture we might be editing your story aswell
spacex,removed,can i repost this on reddit without crediting the source of course s but for real though im scared to go outside these days that one day something it gonna fly over and kill me
spacex,removed,¯ツ¯ maybe
spacex,removed,so is this now smithereens
spacex,removed,cut corners really you got sources to back up a bold claim like that
spacex,removed,i hope that shit was insured
spacex,removed,fucking weirdo here can i use your photos
spacex,removed,upussyonapedestal here can i look at your pictures
spacex,removed,each pod will come with an inflight oculus rift with elite dangerous loaded on it
spacex,removed,here can we use the pictures and your visa card number thanks
spacex,removed,ok misleading mark fooled me
spacex,removed,expect an announcement soon that space x is going purely hypergolic for stage to dodge curse
spacex,removed,i just hope its not that damn strut again
spacex,removed,originated around upper stage oxygen tank oh no not again
spacex,removed,what about os x or linux
spacex,removed,holy crap that was quick
spacex,removed,conspiracy theory the cause of the explosion was the payload and it wasnt an accident it was intentional thanks to the successes of spacex and tesla elon could have been the most powerful person on earth in a few decades but mark zuckerberg didnt like the idea of him not being the most powerful so he decided to plant a bomb in the payload so that spacex will fail
spacex,removed,oh wow just wow
spacex,removed,came here to say re title shame it wasnt a cold fire that exploded but that was definitely worth it best rud yet spacex will be fine chin up peeps
spacex,removed,i hope they find the cause quickly but ive often wondered about spacex vulnerability to sabotage by state actors or private interests
spacex,removed,wtf its not rocket scienceoh wait
spacex,removed,can i send them to my dad
spacex,removed,well fuck
spacex,removed,looks like a hyperspeed bird impact to the second stage jk
spacex,removed,can you imagine if it was the struts again
spacex,removed,rip heavy falcon launch in
spacex,removed,all i can think is anyone would be nuts to sit on top of that rocket
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,just remember failing is learning ok now repeat it until you feel it failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning failing is learning
spacex,removed,am i the only one that had an impulse to catch them
spacex,removed,everytime the falcon blows up the payload survives then falls to its death challenger crew had the same fate
spacex,removed,full thrust variant now has an success rate can you read
spacex,removed,my brain was like thats the birds fault it must be look how fast it was
spacex,removed,i woke up sunday morning and recalled a dream about a rocket exploding no bullshit
spacex,removed,i think if it was an automated pad abort they could probably have gotten out im not sure about a manual abort though
spacex,removed,i know there is an elon musk hard on here but what is the actual advantage of space x versus the prior launches through nasas mission control it seems that space x suffers from launch failures at a high enough rate that their successes are as big of a deal as their failures
spacex,removed,yeah i watched that live so ive watched several super bowls live but doesnt mean i was a part of that team
spacex,removed,it seems to me that they fired the wrong engine
spacex,removed,httpimgurcomaptozf
spacex,removed,looks like it originates on the strongback or just behind it but very odd being that high this is gonna sound a little wacky but i cant help but wonder if this was malicious i know its farfetched but with the company that made supposedly being bought out and the sale contingent on the successful launch of it feels weird just throwing that out there
spacex,removed,as much as it could sound like unimportant bullshit for technically oriented folks here pr saying we gonna go where none went before right after you relaunched your reusable rocket sounds very different than the same thing right after your rocket experienced lame explosion not even in flight
spacex,removed,hum i see but would i would still call that a nsrud notsorapidunscheduleddisassembly
spacex,removed,thats a great attitude youre all fired please collect your things and leave the premises immediately
spacex,removed,oh fuck
spacex,removed,happy cake day
spacex,removed,please nothing on this mission was one of a kind youre doing the opposite of making fun and its just as pathetic
spacex,removed,this cool new website i found called google is also pretty good took me about seconds to find what it meant but hey ¯ツ¯
spacex,removed,can i use the pictures to masturbate to i will definitely think of you as the source however
spacex,removed,are you saying jet fuel can melt steal beams
spacex,removed,on the moon
spacex,removed,the cost of the value of a satellite compared with an expensive film production does not warranty your social justice warrior spiel no
spacex,removed,your gif shows an object moving across the frame at about fairing level does anyone know what that object could be could a bird move that fast rewatching the video there seem to be at least two preexplosion fast moving objects
spacex,removed,a google selfdriving car was seen leaving the scene at high speed
spacex,removed,lol
spacex,removed,seeing the payload hit the ground and explode explosion is painful ftfy
spacex,removed,my bet is there are a bunch of lawyers that are going to make a bunch of money due to todays events
spacex,removed,why are you trying to keep your name off these pictures it seems like you and your friend may have had something to do with this explosion
spacex,removed,where explosion start clear video
spacex,removed,shouldve paid by paypal couldve claimed a chargeback
spacex,removed,space travel is still an extremely dangerous venture i hope there were no people hurt
spacex,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlnbougmazxe
spacex,removed,you can almost see the squirrel who decided to take a nap on the exposed electrical wiringarcboom damn squirrels
spacex,removed,my totally uninformed prediction spacex will agree to purchase and merge with spacecom in order to save them just like how elon merged solarcity and tesla
spacex,removed,pretty obvious innit
spacex,removed,without a doubt that said what else is there to do while we wait has a betting pool started up yet im going old school and voting for increased corrosion of the coupling due to the weather
spacex,removed,it seems hard for me to explain what happened it looks like fuel and oxidiser were mixed from the very first moment there is an intense light indicating a large release of energy would a spark in the lox tank be capable of generating an explosion light that
spacex,removed,what does qc have to do with this
spacex,removed,then they need their rockets to stop exploding captain obvious over here
spacex,removed,do we recon that that thunk noise is from the rocket itself
spacex,removed,not likely to stop spacoms stock from cratering
spacex,removed,its all over again
spacex,removed,yeah but spacex saved a whole day
spacex,removed,dude humor
spacex,removed,homer simpson and ill just get us started hmm i wonder what this button will do copilot uhh well need that to live sir
spacex,removed,based
spacex,removed,thats pretty sexy right there
spacex,removed,yes
spacex,removed,whos bezos s different targets no compettion
spacex,removed,the strongback sure has a strong back it tried its hardest but in the end it couldnt handle the weight of the load its ok buddy you can let go no one will blame you we can rebuild you we can make you stronger we have the technology
spacex,removed,my naive theory is that the helium tanks pressurized the lox tanks with umbilical valves still open
spacex,removed,andddddd rip ears
spacex,removed,my first thoughts were oh for fucks sake not again
spacex,removed,nightmare scenario spacex secretly used an old second stage one without the struts fixed to try to save costs not likely but we know they had multiple second stages with the old faulty struts its possible
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,dang
spacex,removed,is there rly a company who will cover a satellite
spacex,removed,i work for news central florida can you send nudes
spacex,removed,the nazi mods removed my comment for not being of high enough quality but at least you got to read it which was my intent onwards and upwards
spacex,removed,space is hard spacex is harder
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,seems simple to test just strap some explosives to the bottom of the crew capsule and check for cabin overpressure events
spacex,removed,calling it now zuckerberg rigged his hydrazinefilled satellite to have a malfunction on the launch pad so that the media could blame spacex for it just like they really dont want trump to win they really dont want us achieving affordable space exploration either theyll try every dirty trick in the book
spacex,removed,as if i didnt already dislike suckerberg enough what an idiot
spacex,removed,whyd u crop out the ufo that flies right at the falcon as it explodes
spacex,removed,hey if you need a satellite launched why dont you just use blue origin since theyre basically the same thing lmao
spacex,removed,definitely a pad issue
spacex,removed,sigh thanks for making my point that its pointless arguing with someone who wont listen and has literally zero idea of what theyre talking about enjoy the rest of the sub
spacex,removed,my guess is human safety once you test fire theres always a risk that something somewhere is still burning no need having someone loading payload when theres that risk loss of life would not only be far more tragic it would set this kind of program back much farther than a lost payload
spacex,removed,do you know what happened already what if it was literally a frayed wire on the strongback
spacex,removed,zuckerberg is such a douche that fb post was dripping with passive aggression towards spacex ffs try and act like a professional
spacex,removed,call me a conspiracy nut but plane based lasers man creating hotspots making rockets explode
spacex,removed,ugh i really fucking hate the msm sometimes
spacex,removed,changed my gizmodo avatar to a falcon pic late last night wake up to an exploded falcon sorry buddy that one was my fault
spacex,removed,obviously the rocket was sabotaged by a very intelligent labrador that wanted to take the day off
spacex,removed,ill have fh launch tomorrow please
spacex,removed,if were not limiting ourselves to at least somewhat likely events id say the worst case is that the explosion awoke a firedemon that was sleeping deep in the ground below the launch pad and it will come to the surface to enslave all of humanity spacex folding comes close second though
spacex,removed,rip
spacex,removed,no we already know that that one works
spacex,removed,rip
spacex,removed,whoever is downvoting your post should get a life
spacex,removed,hurry up elon with a ssto
spacex,removed,what if elon planned this to bring in viewers oo its an expensive commercial
spacex,removed,but rocket fuel dont melt no steam beams jk pls dont hurt
spacex,removed,spoiler actually the strongback exploded
spacex,removed,shock tested
spacex,removed,zoom enhance where is csi when we need it
spacex,removed,a so called static test i believe it will now be referred to as a hopeitsstatic test
spacex,removed,heres your sign
spacex,removed,hi i worked at buzzfeed i already used your photo and didnt give anyone credit s
spacex,removed,the space shuttle never stopped exploding
spacex,removed,does anyone else see the object that flies past moving from the right side of the screen to the left right before the explosion
spacex,removed,fl hasnt legalized anything
spacex,removed,maybe elon musk can take a page out of paypals book and have these notifications for failed launches your account rocket launch has been limited
spacex,removed,so i rightclickedsearched google for explosion to look up the definition and see if theres an actual difference and this is what i get httpimgurcomabouyb
spacex,removed,no chance theres a transporterserectorsrus store in the neighborhood
spacex,removed,isnt that normal practice for spacex anyway
spacex,removed,its marketing and its sexy
spacex,removed,all that rocket fuel and the tower stayed up qed thermite in wtc
spacex,removed,if no one was hurt im calling this a win for humanity apparently it was a facebook satellite
spacex,removed,where did you get your observation from
spacex,removed,conservatives do not hate all types of government
spacex,removed,you forgot about time travel angry terminators with valid gripes about the last movies ticket sales
spacex,removed,try reading the comment you replied to again
spacex,removed,i always figured the government would pull the plug on spacex when they start to get serious about sending us citizens to mars everything is so risk averse nowadays that theres no way theyll allow thousands of citizens to be blasted off into outer space
spacex,removed,this gonna get like that simpsons episode
spacex,removed,and lose the antiintellectual and antiscience votes i dont think thats a good idea
spacex,removed,you beat me to it
spacex,removed,i see what you did there
spacex,removed,dang you guys are fast
spacex,removed,moment of silence
spacex,removed,maybe they are doing just that maybe the only thing holding the fh demo flight is that they are designing a fairing huge enough to put the model s and x in orbit
spacex,removed,rest in peace falcon heavy debut rest in peace dragon crewed flight
spacex,removed,its clearly a conspiracy in the day time youd see the helicopter hovering with the stage ready to drop it onto the pad
spacex,removed,get ken block to drift between firing thrusters
spacex,removed,d
spacex,removed,can we put this on the sidebar next to each mission
spacex,removed,landing on solid ground is easy landing on solid ground without exploding is hard
spacex,removed,its the verge im actually astonished they didnt somehow weave apple into the article
spacex,removed,anyone wanna explain to me why they dont just land in a giant ball pit silly but other designs seem to offer easy landing options and the balanced tripod is about as tricky as it could be isnt that a big reason why the sea landings work well is that they have a shock absorbing landing pad i like the ball pit idea with a little elevator at the bottom to lift it out
spacex,removed,httpstwittercomelonmusk schaffffff flight is def capable of flying again but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions this message was created by a bot
spacex,removed,tau
spacex,removed,does count d
spacex,removed,please tell me im not the only one who read ksc as kerbal space center
spacex,removed,day one hey elon would you mind sending these military bytes over your transponder day two hey elon would you mind letting us see these nonmilitary bytes that get to your transponder
spacex,removed,china will probably ban the sales of tesla if elon dont follow their decision i doubt china will shoot sats down just because they dont someone broadcast overhead the ban on tesla car is the only threat to elon to force spacex follow their regulations
spacex,removed,we shall call it earths low orbit network
spacex,removed,wtf i literally made a comment about how china would have a problem with this last time this was posted but it got auto moderated
spacex,removed,whens the last time you saw china be responsible
spacex,removed,shittles
spacex,removed,fueling cryolox boogaloo
spacex,removed,it could be considered an act of war in which case ill enlist
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,posts should be about spacex it is you dumbass mods theres a rising attack group that will soon be tapped by trump fighting against elon musk that you should be aware of
spacex,removed,i hate how china is always portrayed with pictures of military shit theres so much beauty there
spacex,removed,spacespace lel
spacex,removed,think of it as a bureaucracyannoyance surcharge
spacex,removed,im sure glad there was a conveniently located drone ship for the red dragon to land on
spacex,removed,hype master musk delivering the goods after am est its lit fam
spacex,removed,looks like mct is now going to be interplanetary transporter or something along those lines
spacex,removed,i thought about httpsenwikipediaorgwikicyclopscomics for some reason when saw this
spacex,removed,the future is here
spacex,removed,so stoked
spacex,removed,i you people just make alt accounts to give comments gold
spacex,removed,through hours of convoluted math and general conjecture i have determined that it is exactly oomphs of thrust
spacex,removed,interested as well
spacex,removed,translation its an itty bitty raptor
spacex,removed,i knew it well done spacex
spacex,removed,raw and outta nowhere also this is a pretty good birthday present to me from elon musk p
spacex,removed,just put raptors under the falcon increase the length to meters and change the prop to ps this is a joke
spacex,removed,so hyped for tuesday d
spacex,removed,normally if a rocket blows it destroys pretty much everything around it anyways so may as well crank up the pressure
spacex,removed,theres a reason the test complex is located next to cow farms s
spacex,removed,beans or no deal
spacex,removed,hypergolic engineers
spacex,removed,im sick with excitement go spacex
spacex,removed,rocketry pun
spacex,removed,damn they have cool names for every thing
spacex,removed,your english is very good almost flawless you still hit the consonants a tad hard though
spacex,removed,you seem to be drawing a lot of conclusions from very little data
spacex,removed,yeah well if you try to refine your by exploding them you deserve your budget cut
spacex,removed,ive already watched that video months ago p
spacex,removed,well this some amazing news to wake up to now im overly hyped for this week at iac and the mars architecture announcement
spacex,removed,can someone explain to me in english what any of this means
spacex,removed,ablatively cooled jesus
spacex,removed,holy shit
spacex,removed,when you get the taco pack at taco bell
spacex,removed,spacex needs to be careful too many of these tests may mess with the earths rotation
spacex,removed,so youre saying its okay to not care because the chinese dont care humans for you
spacex,removed,at the rate things are going they could rewater mars just with the shock diamond drool
spacex,removed,welcome to russia you need rocket we build rocket you need big rocket we build more rocket
spacex,removed,i can find the video of this test on youtube why not i want to hear this thing roar

spacex,removed,yeah this occured to me too i can imagine superrich people paying other people to colonize mars for the sake of it think arab princes paying envoys to go to spread islam on mars the vatican might send a priest hahahaha
spacex,removed,i cant get over the fact that one of the more intelligent sources that i have to explain to friends and family is bitchtitfucker mom listen this dude bitchtitfucker knows what hes talking about
spacex,removed,amateur nonsense the internet is making you stupid
spacex,removed,hi i have a galaxy what are my chances for insur pop
spacex,removed,great now i want to ask elon musk to throw a burger at his rocket to prove your theory thanks ambiwlans p
spacex,removed,found the reason for the spacex pad explosion
spacex,removed,quoting kim e keller their data servers are located at the pad and those servers were lost so theyre relying on the data streams that were recorded by nasa which are not as high fidelity as what sx lost this is going to be a hard one end quote google kim e keller he has the credentials to make this statement as i understand it this was from facebook
spacex,removed,on the positive side the likelihood that oliver stone will make a movie about space x is skyrocketing the fuel line is swinging back and to the left

spacex,removed,have you guys seen the maniac on youtube saying the barge landing is faked something about a ball earth theory its pretty hilarious but im not sure i want to encourage more views for this mad man it could almost be turned into a commercial for spacex because yes what theyve accomplished does seem nearly impossible
spacex,removed,how do you guys jump on this stuff so quick oo
spacex,removed,people keep forgetting elon uses his native martian calendar so reflight by end of next martian year

spacex,removed,for the second stage was obviously venting during a few seconds before any explosion here we see nothing and the suddenness of the explosion is a challenge for any launch abort system the payload stood still apparently undamaged for a few seconds though indicating the upward blast was not too hard but the main point is they cannot afford a repeat ever you can loose a rocket from time to time not a launch pad if there were true alternatives short term they would be out of a job to paraphrase elon this is not how a century launch pad should end even if it is not a death blow i think the lost credibility will follow them a long time can anyone imagine what their customers are thinking about novice is the word that comes to mind any downvote will be welcome thx
spacex,removed,conspiracy theorists claim aliens sabotaged spacex launch as bizarre theory says anomaly flew over rocket as it went up in flames
spacex,removed,pretty sure its the magic bullet going for its final target
spacex,removed,follows the same trajectory as the fairing did
spacex,removed,holy bleep the comments on that video are horrible
spacex,removed,can we be sure it was spacexs fault has sabotage been ruled out israel has some deadly enemies
spacex,removed,i think its time to buy
spacex,removed,in this post comment will update with media shared in comments downvote if unwanted selfdeletes if score is less than rchrisolivertimes rradditplaylists
spacex,removed,parents friends sounds like your parents didnt have very nice friends
spacex,removed,do you also work for spacex by any chance
spacex,removed,conspiracy theorists claim aliens sabotaged spacex launch as bizarre theory says anomaly flew over rocket as it went up in flames
spacex,removed,the benefit of doing it through adjudication is that whatever outcome is reached will be final and wont be subject to further litigation ding ding ding
spacex,removed,formatting suggestion stick a hash i think americans call it a pound sign in front of each persons place in the scoreboard to make them more noticeable i was lost in nostalgia and skipped through two people before i realised the numbers had reset that or put the submissions youre recounting in a quote demo top submitters top submissions points submissions uechologic points or top submitters top submissions points submissions uechologic points ok i see how doing that breaks the numerical formatting you were going for heck even adding the strikethroughs when i realised i was wrong was a pain in the ass
spacex,removed,haha jokes on themit was a fob shipping point delivery id theres anyone out there that gets this id be amazed
spacex,removed,dont they have a backup i mean nasa hs an entire backup iss model here on earth if something goes wrong
spacex,removed,this is abnormal yes it is
spacex,removed,da but az jou can zee the contract does not spezify if ze paylod were built to survive lithobreaking we merly assumed ze manufacturer would build az strongh satillite az we russians do pleaze hav dis vodka az a token ov how zorry we ar for this oversight
spacex,removed,i take this as strong evidence that the lawsuit is de rigeur lawsuits in the launch business are not de rigueur launch contracts are renowned for the great precision with which they spell out liability and lack therof the contract binding spacex and spacecom should have described exactly the situation that occurred just as likely these contracts hold spacex entirely harmless of any liability resulting from spacecoms loss
spacex,removed,the standards of the launch services industry arent typical of the greater business world it is a long established practice that launch providers contractually require their customers to hold them harmless in the event of a payload loss any payload loss for any reason payload insurers are well aware of these provisions it therefore seems beyond belief that spacecom would be required by its insurers to file suit against spacex there is simply no point in their doing so at a guess spacecom is flailing in response to the massive hit theyve taken in the stock market while they may have insured they hardware loss they likely havent insured the business continuance loss meaning they may not have revenue enough to make it through the years it will take to ready and launch a replacement satellite we should remember that a threat to sue isnt the same as suing once spacecoms lawyers take a hard look at their contracts that have been signed actual lawsuits against spacex may never be filed
spacex,removed,interesting timing
spacex,removed,its difficult to understand the desire to believe this is business as usual it isnt not even a little payload owners do not litigate against launch providers for lost payloads it simply isnt done the contracts tend to be rock solid removing all liability from the launch provider no this isnt how the rest of the world typically works threatening to sue everyone in sight is often a sign of desperation at a guess thats whats happening here spacecoms stock is in freefall and theyre flailing if an actual suit against spacex is ever filed spacecom or their insurers it will be surprising if such a suit were to be won it would be astounding
spacex,removed,are they sure it want their satellite that blew up first gnome sayan
spacex,removed,does no extra cost mean spacecom can get a free launch from spacex extra is the key word a new launch will cost but wont cost extra launch payments tend to be made at predetermined milestones a certain amount is paid when the launch is booked more is paid as each milestone is achieved it would seem that million of the roughly million in launch fees had been paid the rest was presumably due closer to launch time it is now spacecoms option whether to have that the million theyve paid refunded or applied to a future launch if they choose a future launch that launch will not be free it will be covered by the fees that have already been paid and probably require the additional million or so that hadnt yet been paid if they select a refund instead one imagines theyll need to rebook a launch and start the process again from the beginning paying all the same fees on a similar schedule tldr they can get a refund of money paid or apply those funds to a future launch they wont get a refund and then get a free launch
spacex,removed,if you arent a lawyer working in contracting satellite insurance agreements you mean bird law
spacex,removed,but in the slow motion it flies between the towers
spacex,removed,el rato has no business with spacex out out out
spacex,removed,less bold than you think democrats in the state have more kids the hispanic population which is also shifting the political balance the trick has been getting hispanics to the polls the current republican nominee is doing a highly effective job of convincing this population of the importance of registration and voting so the switch to a democratic majority has likely been accelerated by a decent chunk of time
spacex,removed,implying that fat dracula were capable of taking ideas from others in the first place
spacex,removed,yes its slowly turning blue with everyone fleeing blue states like ca for greener pastures problem is they vote blue when they get hereslowly recreating the situation they were fleeing from in the first place go figure
spacex,removed,weather demonstration satellite weather control when
spacex,removed,uber every fuckin where
spacex,removed,this will not be adequate to return me to my home planet httpwwwtedcruzforhumanpresidentcom
spacex,removed,are you implying that hispanics are incapable of voting anything other than democrat
spacex,removed,poscal thank you for writing you had my interest until that last sentence which makes no sense would that last sentence make more sense to you if you replaced the words civilized etc with other words eg would you write would the homelands of europeans be as secure prosperous technologically advanced powerful and attractive to immigrants from the natural resource rich paradises of the third world if their inhabitants were no more law abiding than those at
spacex,removed,jeff bezos tears
spacex,removed,why not obama is buddies with the russians and clinton even more so
spacex,removed,denier is a loaded term cruz is a global warming skeptic which many scientist agree with saying cc is proven is false and really only is said by political hacks
spacex,removed,being against public funds for global warming does not make one a science denier in fact the real science deniers are the ones who say global warming is a fact when it has failed basic scientific proof
spacex,removed,hes just despicable enough to filibuster an sls budget bill
spacex,removed,indeed ask him about funding for climate change science such as oceanography satellites
spacex,removed,edit also why all the downvotes because ted is in the title were there any doubts
spacex,removed,the problem with global warming is that the observed data just keeps ignoring the predictions made by the theory the gw true believers have to fall back on ad hominem attacks like calling their political opponents science deniers instead of following wherever the data leads true scientists are always skeptics
spacex,removed,cruz runs on a party platform that campaigns against this how does one campaign against climate change if you didnt believe in it or at least dont believe its caused or aggravated by human influences wouldnt that be like campaigning against the tooth fairy to continue the metaphor the campaign is against using public funds to chase after the tooth fairy in ted cruzs world the private corporation tesla can do whatever the heck it wants just dont ask for government for a handout to forward someones pet political ideology knowing a lot of conservatives their beef with tesla if they have one is taking government money not making solar panels batteries and really fast electric cars once they learn that all those loans have been paid off etc they chill out as opposed to outfits like solyndra which were essentially money laundering operations thankfully tesla seems able to stand on their own feet and if government subsidies are your religion then california is your holy land
spacex,removed,lets keep it about rampart
spacex,removed,i honestly think the roc archetecture for bfr and bfs looks ugly no offense but it honestly looks like mct is wearing a klan hoodie also whats with bfs being larger diameter then bfr i think bfs will be wide maybe look like a typical mars direct style mavhab it definetly wont be that pointy theres no need for it to be
spacex,removed,is it just me or does von braun sound like a hoser i swear i hear some canadian raising in there lmao
spacex,removed,is echos plane from wlgakl
spacex,removed,theyre dipping heavily into the capital raised from investors elon tells investors they can have their money back when they reach mars
spacex,removed,the more i learned about it over time on this sub this sub is basically slshaters club so i wouldnt put much attention to what you can read here about sls especially that most of those haters dont put as much scrutiny in uncovering the flaws in spacex plans the falcon heavy was supposed to fly in now the optimistic prediction is and if the reusable boosters idea turns out to be a failure remember spacex has not flown any recovered stage and costs of refurbishing are unknown then the whole fh will be a failure as well too weak for high profile beo missions predicted for sls and way too strong for commercial flights
spacex,removed,and do the otha things
spacex,removed,good hedging trump seems like hes going to go in and try to cut every single program that is over budget and behind schedule you know basically everything to pay for his tax cuts
spacex,removed,fuck a speech nothing inspires more than actions
spacex,removed,why you gotta be hatin man
spacex,removed,im afraid the only true part of your comment is people that disagree with us here that is not accepted
spacex,removed,already had this
spacex,removed,the speech of his life is when hell be inaugurating the first mars government
spacex,removed,youre my favourite bot decronym
spacex,removed,run away
spacex,removed,it was gremlins wasnt it rearing their head again after being relatively quiet since wwii
spacex,removed,ah man is echo still time travelling he is missing this
spacex,removed,but what would happen if a bullet struck the copv helium tank though
spacex,removed,as i understand it the update doesnt rule out the bullet theory
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,death by committee is exactly what is strangling nasa
spacex,removed,time for more videos of copvs being shot athehehe
spacex,removed,bullshit do you know anything about copvs how they work how theyre built if not i suggest you keep your accusations to yourself until you understand this
spacex,removed,great example
spacex,removed,but but but what about a bullet going into the tank and puncturing the im kidding obviously
spacex,removed,cryogenic helium system lana be careful jesus the helium
spacex,removed,copvs work in a specific way as stated above relative to us both are cold but relative to the the is cold and the lox really hot
spacex,removed,i should have known it all problems lead back to helium i think there is a corollary to money is the root of all evil helium is the root of all ruds helium is the root of most ruds helium is murphys kissing cousin any decaying helium atom is a good helium atom what do you call million fused helium atoms a good start
spacex,removed,take this all with a grain of salt as i am just an armchair rocket engineer but this is how i currently see the situation so my inital guess is that the design is good but requires a flawless manufacturing process and the manufacturer process is not faultless and the testing for faults is not full proof the process is mostly faultless but not you would think a static fire would be sufficient to test the helium system but apparently not perhaps the helium tanks need to be tested repeatedly and in various ways to find any faults perhaps a better design would be more fault tolerate or have a manufacturing process that is less likely to have hidden faults that could escape inspection but there is no guarantee of either further the delay caused by such a redesign may not be financially solvent i do like that the next gen rockets will not need a helium system to keep pressure thus eliminating the whole system that caused this anomaly further an new version of the may be designed but spacex has many current designs in the pipeline already my prediction assuming i am anything close to reality with my analysis is that spacex drastically increases the quantity and depth of helium system tests based on the idea that the system does work most of the time the trick in lieu of a major redesign would be to find errors before the article gets anywhere the launch pad and payload
spacex,removed,just gotta say i called it
spacex,removed,given oig is basically congress wouldnt you expect them to act in the interests of ula
spacex,removed,there is a thing that some manufactures have called a welding torch i dont know precisely how they would do it but im sure they can without too much trouble
spacex,removed,at least present the triangulation report redacted for itar protection this still would show the triangulation accuracy as evidence why do they not do this was it bs
spacex,removed,i dont think you understand how carbon fiber reinforced plastic composites work
spacex,removed,videos in this thread videocomment just had dinner with a credible source i trust that spacex is about sure a copv issue was the cause explosion originated in the lox tank copv container that had some weird harmonics while loading lox update spacex partially c millions of small broken carbon fibers mixed into the lox here is a video of carbon fiber failing under load and disintegrating into millions of little bits care of the hydraulic press channel source its confirmed in this video but its almost minutes long definitely a good watch though diagnosed by spacex nasa was not convinced and that will be very important factor in how spacex makes its rtf i expect the data will now be reexamined to see if it is consistent with the diagnosis of the explosion edit its time im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
spacex,removed,in the meantime while the tension is rising for tuesdays big reveal you can put on repeat in the background while reading rspacex
spacex,removed,you mean it wasnt space aliens or obama
spacex,removed,any mention about the object flying at a speed of at least in the background while the is exploding
spacex,removed,an oldie but goldie
spacex,removed,seriously shut the hell up nobody cares about your false worldview keep it spacex rated
spacex,removed,donald the chinese are going to mars donald wrong were going to mars first and we were going before china thought about going
spacex,removed,thats a parked rocket
spacex,removed,we call it vandy makes us feel cool
spacex,removed,if that date holds watching that launch would sure be an awesome birthday present fingers crossed
spacex,removed,oh yes they did used an accounting gimmick to cash in a year of emissions credits all at once to create a slight profit that was obviously an unsustainable moved and they are back to losses
spacex,removed,yellow and everything i mean they had to either call it that or a rocket condom
spacex,removed,never really thought about it but this pic makes it look like a giant mans genitals elon has big ones

spacex,removed,dammit mythbusters where are you when we need you
spacex,removed,about to get laid sorry
spacex,removed,it landed off center rshittyrobots s
spacex,removed,elon for scale the rspacex substitute for a banana
spacex,removed,questions be like
spacex,removed,elon musk president
spacex,removed,i love how this is exactly my general plan for all of my interplanetary launches in ksp
spacex,removed,aha what question was that in relation to do you recall
spacex,removed,elon musk disagrees and youre visionary behind this he is
spacex,removed,stop spamming this dumb answer everywhere
spacex,removed,its men like musk that will lead this world to its salvation
spacex,removed,maybe thats what the new mustachegoatee was all about he finally joined the club you know elon would get a lot more investors is he was just a little evil hmmm he said he only gained assets to fund its what is he willing to do fund mars s because ive learned i have to
spacex,removed,step profit
spacex,removed,should have pre screened questions dont give the mic to anyone without a fucking half baked thought taking around in their head
spacex,removed,so cool
spacex,removed,any plans of elon musk creating new technologies that could benefit the human race not our egos
spacex,removed,damn reds
spacex,removed,lol get off elons dick the engineers are the ones putting in the work
spacex,removed,you dont play ksp do you
spacex,removed,yo man once youve finished chugging on that koolaid can you pass it my way
spacex,removed,this is so beautiful it made me tear up
spacex,removed,and lets not forget the guy publicly pressuring elon to vet his electric bus outside after so many wasted opportunities for technical details
spacex,removed,im continually amazed at the number of people willing to embarrass and humiliate themselves for a few seconds of free publicity sad really
spacex,removed,in my fantasy meme version which i have no way of making i imagine the mars rovers at night imaging its from the martian surface as its is doing the aerobraking maneuver looking like a fireball during that slower part of the music fun to think about anyway
spacex,removed,they forgot to mention the gondolas
spacex,removed,listen dummy i spent over a decade of my life working as a molecular biologist working with betalactamase cassette plasmids on a daily basis and doing research on bacterial antibiotic resistance i absolutely guarantee that i know far far far more about betalactam antibiotics and their interactions with bacterial resistance than you do what you posted had nothing to do with the op post youre the one thats going around posting irrelevant information and calling things ridiculous concerns shut it
spacex,removed,is everyone high thinking this is likely
spacex,removed,she can try stealing underwear
spacex,removed,how about retropropulsive spacesuits
spacex,removed,i was so mad about the michael cera thing i was just man this is the biggest space announcement since goddamn apollo at least and youre trying to drive web traffic to your bloody website rage let someone with a real question take a shot thanks
spacex,removed,michael cera is an actor known for playing rather stereotypically dorky characters the question was still disrespectful and a total waste of valuable elon question time
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,mother fucking telescopes
spacex,removed,that would be my vote as well
spacex,removed,steel underpants
spacex,removed,commercial money from funny or die and rooster teeth or whatever means they can afford to send idiots unfortunately
spacex,removed,these are your seven lifetimes use them
spacex,removed,michael cera guy pissed me off the most hes told to stfu with the bs but he continues anyway and the idea is so lame and pitching it here so disrespectful what a fucking moron
spacex,removed,mars has no intelligent life i was about to make a snarky comment about earth but then i noticed the this is not the place to complain about it part in the submission text
spacex,removed,you completely forgot about aimed water cannons and parachutes lots and lots of parachutes
spacex,removed,i love you
spacex,removed,goldmann man id pay so much to watch that the funny thing is hillary would die and trump would shrug
spacex,removed,elon musk is going to be tony stark
spacex,removed,governmental efficiency™
spacex,removed,my conclusion from this exercise was that most people are fucking morons and dont deserve to go to mars
spacex,removed,i have already stolen twelve pairs of underpants as part of my effort to assist the its do i send them to spacex headquarters or address them directly to pad cape canaveral
spacex,removed,worth it
spacex,removed,stealing underpants
spacex,removed,look we sstod this scale elon action figure into a orbit
spacex,removed,😞 but i want a vacation beach house on mars
spacex,removed,mind blown
spacex,removed,i dont get it
spacex,removed,passengers for the b ark
spacex,removed,you dont s
spacex,removed,and the flight computer on the first will no doubt be called eddie
spacex,removed,oh this is just a load of horseshit crippling debt you mean the price of a new car if you cant afford to pay that with your new career you picked the wrong career ive got two kids and im doing it its tough but i dont sit and whine that i have to make sacrafices to actually make something of my life
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,shit ill put up bucks
spacex,removed,im here raising my lips can you see meee
spacex,removed,if only we could divert the interests of the masses from trash tv towards space travel wed be much further along than we are today fuckthis planet for the mostpart
spacex,removed,i really hope there will be a huge backlash against funnyordie or whatever that web site is sending totally inane selfserving idiots to gorilla market their stupidity i for one will be boycotting their crap though it wont matter much because i never really watched it we drove million web views to the hillary clintonzac galimatias youtube video stfu already
spacex,removed,gonna invest in towelcompanies
spacex,removed,they should be publicly flogged d
spacex,removed,one thing to take into consideration is that not everyone will be awake at the same time chances are that they stagger them into sleep shifts so will be in sleep cubicles at a specific time the sheer logistics around this will be staggering from little details to minimize the load on the air filters no body hair to methods of limiting psychological stress by keeping them busy most of the time will be spent doing things like routine maintenance swabbing down all surfaces with a fungicide exercising to keep muscle mass lectures to allow for skills transfer so imagine a ship falling through the void filled with bald headed people in overalls dutifully performing their allotted duties waiting for the promised land oh crap mars will be settled by a cult
spacex,removed,come outside see my electric bus
spacex,removed,if i want to become one of the first people to go to mars how would i begin towards my ambitions
spacex,removed,and the next thing we knew would be a group of inter galactic extra terrestrial species claiming their space on the piece of land on mars
spacex,removed,tom mueller but it would be enough to have engines elon i dont care it has to be make it work later and i also want you to come up with a new infinite probability drive asap
spacex,removed,cost you astronomical amounts of money heh

spacex,removed,i made this rad comic book with a guy living on mars that looks like elon how can i give it to him and be sure he actually receives it its a really cool comic book
spacex,removed,i think thats the first time ive looked at a gantt chart and liked it
spacex,removed,sigh did you read the final sentence
spacex,removed,am i understanding this right the current raptor that is the outside of the first humans on mars maybe even the first official spacex mct render on a year timescale
spacex,removed,or elon will go bankrupt nope many are prepared to steal underpants on his behalf
spacex,removed,high altitude landing build an avengersstyle helicarrier take it up to km let rocket land on carrier refuel launch easy just need to build a helicarrier

spacex,removed,and the acrostic slskp sls killer program
spacex,removed,i wish i could upvote this more times
spacex,removed,i think based on how many idiots were asking questions combined with the cheering we can guestimate that at least of the audience were total tools and not the variety that actually help get shit done i kept wondering during the qa if it was those pesky hackers from who had the brilliant idea to troll elon

spacex,removed,is the original qa available anywhere
spacex,removed,the terraforming was probably sped up and transferred as quickly as possible
spacex,removed,is there an unedited version of the qa
spacex,removed,im not gonna try to persuade you if you are going to be wilfully ignorant educate yourself before making claims and arguing
spacex,removed,i happen to think the spaceship also looks a bit like an orca but whats this big red thing coming towards me it looks hard it needs an aaaar sounding name ill call it mars i wonder if it wants to be friends
spacex,removed,sources i have a feeling that this might be able to contemplate how stupid they are going for vertical landing on mars but i would be really bad for the last few ms sure designing the launch pad

spacex,removed,he was probably talking about the pad foundation itself the existing pedestal and pit can likely get a mating collar installed in place of its current system

spacex,removed,came here wondering if my decision to skip was worthwhile yep confirmed

spacex,removed,booyah
spacex,removed,come on dont be a dick
spacex,removed,same thing i thought of star wars ships
spacex,removed,theyll have a guy with a long match
spacex,removed,they have crap tech that explodes every other launch if they saw the stuff spacex we would be fucked also are you really defending north korea and iran come on its north korea and iran theres nothing to defend about them
spacex,removed,that nice clean blue scifi methane flame oooooooohhhhhh yes
spacex,removed,disclosure i dont work for spacex or a spacex contractor thats exactly what elon musk would say
spacex,removed,dear spx dont bomb cuba or mexico
spacex,removed,hi there please go read the rules of this subreddit and decide if you want to adjust and fit in or not in which case youll probably be banned quickly
spacex,removed,sarcasm well i can think of a few places on the east coast that might be improved by a small tactical nuke sarcasm

spacex,removed,ask not for whom the fire burns it burns for thee
spacex,removed,war with spacex
spacex,removed,ocisly spaceporta wretched hive of scum and villainy we must be cautious
spacex,removed,this is a much better cascade thread than you see on most other
spacex,removed,im far more concerned about the potential for storm surges coupled with sea level rise to damage the launch site frankly dont worry elon will have his butt to mars before the weather apocalypse arrives thats the whole plan isnt it
spacex,removed,its like a month spirit airlines flight
spacex,removed,no shrink they cause problems instead of preventing them take mentally balanced humans instead
spacex,removed,i like how jack sparrow is on the list
spacex,removed,i hope so i cant stand physical movement
spacex,removed,and maybe michael cera too i think ive heard this joke before
spacex,removed,i am really excited by the spacex mars plans but i neither have the sources or the willingness to go to mars but i want to do my parthelp out to make their plans possible therefore spacex should set up a way to crowdfund people for the first missions to mars it would not only help fund the program but also create hype and public interest we are billion people on earth and i am almost sure there are enough people willing to go who also have the resources but there might not be enough or there might be others that are more qualified or enthusiastic but do not have the funds there were and are so many people who took part in experiments about biodomes various simulations etc that already have experience but most likely couldnt afford to got even if they wanted to i could for example imagine giving up to to crowdfund somebody from my state that has some kind of training already and represents my state the way to set it up in my opinion like kickstarter or gofundme but without a fee going to those services everything goes to spacexthe person sponsored anybody can set up a fund for themselves or to find somebody if you want to find somebody you need to set up parameters ie texan has to represent texas has to answer questions from texasfunders etc bavarian has to represent bavaria has to drink beer etc redditor needs to make dank memes wear fedora all the time etc biologist needs to grow potatoes survive everything or a company willing to sponsor somebody as a marketing ploy like a sponsorship eg sony user has to only use sony products has to dis samsung products only the best funded get to go first so if those first people get overfunded it helps the cause move forward faster maybe all money pledged goes to spacex immediately for the cause without chance of reimbursement controversial but think it over additionally i am sure space agencies like esa nasa roscosmos etc would pay a lot of money to get somebody on that first ship
spacex,removed,what can we do
spacex,removed,falcon heavy could do it though
spacex,removed,its raining gators and pit vipers sharknado wasnt far off
spacex,removed,i guess a square is also a rectangle
spacex,removed,yes but then why does it have so much karma
spacex,removed,my mom never allowed that as a reason not to clean my room
spacex,removed,immigration on a serious note centraleastern europe are pretty tame some places have minor floods but most of the time if its a storm some trees fall and thats about it no earthquakesvolcanoes etc
spacex,removed,holy crap we did it
spacex,removed,sorry about all the trouble guys
spacex,removed,a good hollywood plot
spacex,removed,what could we do with million or more people on mars it would cost trillion dollars to send million israelis to mars with the price of dollars per head the fed since has spent trillion dollars bailing out the banks spending trillion dollars alot cheaper than a war with iran
spacex,removed,didnt know brian cranston worked at spacex
spacex,removed,its science betch
spacex,removed,it wasnt all bad we got trump
spacex,removed,i still dont think this post should be allowed regardless of mine if people want to buy spacex gear then they should do it through their website this post is not about the company spacex but rather gear that they sell according to the rules it should not be allowed my post was simply an example and i didnt intend to whine and cry that my post was removed while this wasnt simply an example i quickly deleted it when i realized it wasnt allowed either way its your discretion and i dont want to tell you how to moderate i respect your authority on the spacex subreddit the only reason i may come off as selfinterested is because people enjoy my content as its an exclusive view that not many people see i guess ill tone it down though thanks for the notice
spacex,removed,you just brought a tear to my eye bravo
spacex,removed,i thought this would just be an image of oil calmly sitting in airthis is much better
spacex,removed,it took me a solid forty seconds to figure that out that was good
spacex,removed,bezos sniped the pump
spacex,removed,this is clearly a transitional state
spacex,removed,i dont want to know how someone takes that and turns it into liquid ox
spacex,removed,remember always wrap your dragon when taking it out dragons get cold easily
spacex,removed,and who said dragons didnt exist yes i had to say it and yes its not a quality response but sometimes yah know
spacex,removed,we were so concerned with the sniper theory we failed to consider the theory namely that it was a cruise missile
spacex,removed,not really but if super long range sniper shot has a chance of being true then lox pump sabotage has a chance of being true still extremely small but a thousand times more likely then the sniper shot thats the only point i was making
spacex,removed,sounds like a conspiracy to distract us from the real perpetrators
spacex,removed,why is this flaired as removed

spacex,removed,i hate bob ya i hate him as well wait doesnt he have aneurysms ya why are you asking hey bob were looking for people to go to marswould you like to go the boys at the office have voted to send you to mars i dont think thats a great idea guys im not that healthy hey did you hear what happened stacy no what happened bob had a heart attack and now musk has to make the announcement
spacex,removed,id stay on earth
spacex,removed,wait people were suggesting they fired a sniper rifle at the rocket sniper rifles are loud it would have been picked up by at least some of the onsite microphones i would also guess they have a very recognizable sound signature so it would have been painfully obvious what happened plus theres a good chance theyd find the bullet among the debris also the entry hole would have been picked up by a camera i thought the logical goto theory was a high power laser it could have easily heated up a critical part of the rocket without leaving any traces the ula guys would have the right technical expertise to use such a device and know where to point it to be honest the tinfoilhatwearing part of me suspected a laser last year when exploded but that didnt seem likely my guess is its pretty hard to aim a high power laser at a rocket thats accelerating to orbital velocity and keep it aimed at the same spot long enough to achieve the desired effect a stationary rocket though piece of cake

spacex,removed,musk i have an electric van outside please come and see it
spacex,removed,deniers almost absolute total consensus as long as this vitriol is the consensus it is unlikely that facts supporting the alternate hypothesis can come out therefore it is far more likely than not that otherwise credible people are faking data i personally see large discrepancies netween nasas reported temperatures for my home town and what i record once we accept that it is far more likely than not that the university of east anglia amd nasa are fakimg climate data then there is no credible evidemce of climate change
spacex,removed,looking for a ride home
spacex,removed,bruh this guy sounds like a giant nerd
spacex,removed,you must not be a trump supporter
spacex,removed,out of abundance of caution the launch was aborted due to a faulty youtube stream
spacex,removed,i love this hot nerd talking to me about sexy rocket science
spacex,removed,its a great day for spacex and therefore the world
spacex,removed,or one of us could go out there in a small boat

spacex,removed,olympic judges in rio wouldve given that landing a
spacex,removed,well i mean they could put a barge in orbit but itd be a bit hard to bring it back to port
spacex,removed,gross
spacex,removed,ah yes the synchronized doubles landing event cant wait to take home the gold there as well
spacex,removed,three feet yep sure looks like a meter to me signed a fellow american
spacex,removed,i suppose thats why they put the female announcer in a dress more make up and throw her long blonde hair over her left shoulder so she looksumm sorry nice landing spacex
spacex,removed,i guess you could use wires haha
spacex,removed,a few landings is not routine especially considering when they destroyed more trying to perfect it than have successfully landed now all you spacex fanboys are free to downvote me into oblivion for speaking fact
spacex,removed,hover drone with satellite attached parked near the barge connected by wire
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,its actually but you can keep spinning it and adding stipulations until you get the results youre comfortable with thats how most people do things now a days anyways its not facts and math but feelings even assuming youre right and that only failed if you took of their rd budget for developing the system and used that to build more stages you would end up with far more stages than you destroyed attempting the landing
spacex,removed,is the humans reaction the humans reaction use the apostrophe
spacex,removed,sweet im there anyone with a kayak wanna help me
spacex,removed,what a silly thing to say you really want mods that hide things
spacex,removed,i dreamed that the first stage slipped on ocisly and somehow started another burning phase right into the water looked damn cool because it didnt explode it just became an submarine but im glad that it was just a dream
spacex,removed,sweet just need a mile long ethernet cable
spacex,removed,yeah if you binge watch penn and teller fool us and then watch this clip youre going to think that they pulled a switch
spacex,removed,pbdes always knows his gaze peers into your soul

spacex,removed,oh please you just fire the rocket in reverse no big deal
spacex,removed,and hyperdrive
spacex,removed,reall you need to ask truth honest analysis of the facts problem with the whole cc debate is that facts are far from clear and what gets presented as facts simply are not up to scrutiny
spacex,removed,you work there what do you do there
spacex,removed,disagrees
spacex,removed,seems like its time for spacex to buy its own predator drone that will take care of those pesky tug boats
spacex,removed,these new stages man they dont know how good they have it i remember back in the day when being a stage required real personal sacrifice this generationtheyll never understand
spacex,removed,how long until a movie has the plot point to refuel and escape the earth on the rocket displayed at spacex hq
spacex,removed,kate said awesome sauce right when i was releasing my first stage too bad shes getting fatter but still ok to act as a surrogate so i dont have to admit im wanking to the launch itself
spacex,removed,just give ocisly a long selfies stick

spacex,removed,thats kind of why i offered the caveat below that they found a nonprofit that kind of money may not be donated by people who would be offering their life savings but it may be donated by people who regularly give that kind of money away to nonprofits anyways in theory it would be a missionspecific nonprofit im thinking of things like httpwwwnasagovpressreleasenasascubesatlaunchinitiativeopensspacetoeducatorsnonprofits httpplanetaryorg and httpwwwnssorg only for launchspecific efforts
spacex,removed,mods could we get some of the header links to iac threads replaced with links to campaign threads for the next couple of missions thanks

spacex,removed,i know spacex isnt metric but that would make you a nanobrewer
spacex,removed,hi brian im a chemistry and human physiology graduate thats been interested in what spacex has been doing for many years but i cant bring myself to apply because it just doesnt seem like yall have any room for someone with my kind of background so my hr question i was wondering if spacex will be expanding into any form of research involving astronaut health and safety in the near future or will you be leaving that kind of stuff to nasa thanks
spacex,removed,hey brian im going to college in a month for aerospace engineering you basically have my dream job what advice would you give me to end up working for spacex
spacex,removed,need anyone to run xray or acoustic inspection hardware im highly qualified and a big space lover

spacex,removed,is the stage thats going to be reused for
spacex,removed,flight tested spacex approved they need to start painting this on all flown boosters
spacex,removed,nonmoving picture
spacex,removed,also why not some other color than white silver or pink would be pretty cool
spacex,removed,i like how we both posted basically the exact same thing and our comments are right next to each other wonder whos gonna win
spacex,removed,i noticed on stuffinspace that there are still spacex rockets or second stages from a few years back still in orbit whats the usual sop for these as far as planning for their destruction by reentry is it not possible yet with some launches to have the second stage reenter and burn up
spacex,removed,same goes to hyperloop fans why would anyone play a game which is solved
spacex,removed,bah the backup date is my birthday if that was the first reusable flightit wouldve been the best birthday present ever oh well as is a spacex launch is a great birthday present heres to having all the kinks sorted out
spacex,removed,i hope the barge is of course i still love you
spacex,removed,practicing for its
spacex,removed,launch land and relaunch spacex launch you up
spacex,removed,miceonauts please tell me thats the official name
spacex,removed,there is always a possibility it will crash on landing which will also be an amazing footage kinda

spacex,removed,were gonna build a pad and make blue origin pay for it
spacex,removed,lol
spacex,removed,upvoted for the name
spacex,removed,turn off and on again
spacex,removed,this
spacex,removed,this commentary is getting tedious
spacex,removed,its a bit like watching paint dry right now
spacex,removed,not really
spacex,removed,it will take minutes lol
spacex,removed,also did the lady just tell them to turn it off and on again til im at nasa level of debugging prowess
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,its breathing
spacex,removed,please dont pop please dont pop
spacex,removed,beam engineers must be shitting their pants right now
spacex,removed,so much room for activities
spacex,removed,why utc fuck britain they dont make the rules
spacex,removed,they try to make the rules the rest of us dont give a fuck
spacex,removed,that piece of news deflated my excitement a little bit for today
spacex,removed,two words mate common sense that is what tells me you can go splitting hair like an idiot but then nothing is ever certain a lot of sense can be made by putting all these things together but ofcourse there is nothing for certain things never are so now here is what i will if spacex does claim after the launch one of the engine was reused then come back here and admit you were a fool
spacex,removed,on the iss they have a lot of religious images and a christian orthodox priest blesses each and every soyuz that goes up there one would imagine that this kind of superstition its a thing of the past and has no place in a highly scientific environment like space industry but apparently humans still need to believe in magic more than in science i wish they could baptise the red dragon with tomato sauce in honor to the mighty flying spaghetti monster
spacex,removed,and in breaking untrue news holy water froze into ice that bound the straps in place after release increasing the pressure popped everything free
spacex,removed,this guy knows more than nasa
spacex,removed,pressures eventually climbed above the pressure vs expansion curve plotted out by engineers prompting some head scratching at mission control the concern arising when reaching higher pressures is a sudden rapid expansion of the module instead of the desired gradual deployment should have held off on the whiskey
spacex,removed,read my comment again please i said that i would imagine that religions are a thing of the past but indeed they arent so i agree with you the islamic state its an obvious proof of that reality but we are drifting off topic
spacex,removed,isnt he like a hardcore conspiracy theorist
spacex,removed,failure to inflate i think is what happened this article appears to be a fabricationor worse
spacex,removed,rocket science isnt brain surgery but it is rocket science
spacex,removed,lol definitely no payload integration until static fire is complete
spacex,removed,this is going to be mind blowing he said mind blowing its going to be really great were going to send astronauts theyre going to be the best astronauts i know how to pick them ask anyone theyll tell you i have the best astronauts were going to make mars great again
spacex,removed,dooont caaaaaaaaaare

spacex,removed,whats an elon and why does its musk get so much attention does it smell nice
spacex,removed,itd be a lot cheaper to greatly inflate your resume apply for a job pay some smart kid to go through the phone interview get called in for onsite get tour and take off before the interview starts
spacex,removed,sounds like a trump quote frankly
spacex,removed,just the whole thing is one giant grid fin elon did say we were going to think he was insane
spacex,removed,if shuttle type space vehicles why need the extra wing mass why not just use dragon or something
spacex,removed,i didnt think that my boner for elon could get any bigger
spacex,removed,the comment section on the article are as toxic salty and stupid as trumps supporters
spacex,removed,you gotta do this in ksp now
spacex,removed,or they have to get extremely creative anyone have any ideas sea dragon mars boogaloo
spacex,removed,once the spacex justice warriors sjws start downvoting because someone has an opinion that isnt a glowing endorsement of spacex it is pointless to do anything but rewrite the opinion which i did it is not the same post copypasta
spacex,removed,and the fax machine
spacex,removed,omfg no i have an exam at that day too bad
spacex,removed,tickets seem to be so high but reasonable for us i was skimming and thought these were the prices to get on the mct
spacex,removed,when i read those lines theyre spoken in my head by donald trump
spacex,removed,no
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,i wonder how many takes he did to finally say big falcon rocket
spacex,removed,someone made an overlay of dragon abort footage
spacex,removed,quality of record is awful imho ps
spacex,removed,one day ill attempt something the scale of elon musks accomplishments
spacex,removed,my name is elon musk im your host on todays mars show before we start i want to give a huge shoutout to our patrons these are the people that donated or more through the site patreoncommarsshow to crowdfund our weekly program and gained access to exclusive contents these include instant hd playback of the show several live feeds both from the spacecrafts en rout and the two bases on mars surface and finally having their names written into the martian soil with our autonomous mars rover please consider becoming a patreon yourself and you will receive a special smartphone background picture as our special gift
spacex,removed,theyre going to need to be able to make their own hell musk will see to that when he announces the event horizon day transit time to anywhere in the solar system
spacex,removed,oh shit i love the expanse fucking lanky belters cant take the full
spacex,removed,im just hyped for some martian sports earth gravity basketball anyone
spacex,removed,i feel like a proper space x fan today
spacex,removed,along with an american flag
spacex,removed,big phalcon rocket wink wink nudge nudge
spacex,removed,for now
spacex,removed,that is so florida
spacex,removed,thank you karbala space program for teaching me to actually understand the readouts
spacex,removed,just say you work for nsf
spacex,removed,attach orbiter here black side down
spacex,removed,stop shaking your leg commander but im concentrating yeah but its slowly rotating the damn station
spacex,removed,looks like ksp met pokemon go
spacex,removed,you know for science
spacex,removed,well i think the fcev on the carb valve didnt nox the if the cfd doesnt itn before the maf turns well ianars but its the eol as we know it
spacex,removed,can you think of a better way to measure science
spacex,removed,having played ksp i can vouch for this
spacex,removed,yes these science pounds can be exchanged by spacex for mct technologies if only
spacex,removed,are you saying that spacex is not uses surrealist builders i am so disappointed
spacex,removed,john i tried a couple weeks ago to show off my its models and i kept getting my posts deleted so spacex subreddit is extremely bias towards an exclusive group of people i could not post any pictures of spacex swag i just cant understand this subreddit
spacex,removed,whats the isp on a model s these days anyhow
spacex,removed,take all my upvotes you brilliant man all of them
spacex,removed,wow what a bunch of dicks i bet spacex is bringing in a ton of business for that port not the seaport the spaceport
spacex,removed,i dont understand i thought all you have to do is attach the tanks and then rightclick and altrightclick on the two fuel tanks to get fuel into the main capsule
spacex,removed,no no spacewhales make a lot of noise have to protect against that
spacex,removed,if by repairs you mean mojitos then yes
spacex,removed,so were all cool with the way elon is just slightly a bond villain i mean if thats the uniform ill be a henchmen sure moonraker laser was the best
spacex,removed,well sigh that didnt generate the hype i thought it would looks like were gonna have to start this aerospace company after all
spacex,removed,lol at the kid vocalising all our thoughts thirty minutes
spacex,removed,d all of the above this
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,the bolt tightening of the chamber is riveting
spacex,removed,meh hes just waiting around till he can be one of the first to upload himself into a robot body
spacex,removed,couldnt help but giggle when ones of the teams spokesperson said to make this world a better place mike judge damn you d
spacex,removed,yes amber heard is not interested in anything but elons fortune
spacex,removed,transplant an octoweb into a tbm and youve got tunnels that take weeks not years might have to tweak a few other things as well
spacex,removed,he probably told her that he was excited about the tunneling machine and she replied that it was boring
spacex,removed,most underrated comment
spacex,removed,i bet the usa wouldve won going backwards
spacex,removed,lol
spacex,removed,i just watched the fucking future
spacex,removed,and it will be as fast as kmh
spacex,removed,i literally had nightmares about this exact scenario last night time to take a break from rspacex i guess
spacex,removed,haha somehow just cream on its own without the iss seems a bit more off
spacex,removed,mrotsdnasedurad
spacex,removed,confirmed elon is an alien from the competition rules no human or animal shall ride in any pod or other transportation device used within the test track during this competition or during any precompetition access and yet he was seen sitting in one of the pods explain that
spacex,removed,im sorry what hes actually going ahead with this tunneling idea aiming for a improvement in tunneling speed
spacex,removed,every video i see of something spacexteslahyperloop one related gives me chills what a time to be alive
spacex,removed,work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion so any deadline is futile this industry needs several iterations then well know what kind of duration is acceptable for designing these things
spacex,removed,the grey dot and blue dot are vacuum readings they are labelled position in hyper loop
spacex,removed,but there is so much space between the tube and the pod so i can see theres no magic s
spacex,removed,ok wait if your ai can really read minds what number are we thinking of
spacex,removed,im saving this post so when people say that this subreddit is a great wealth of information i can show them this as proof that its bullshit
spacex,removed,i lold
spacex,removed,comment thread nuked in dont expect much from the mods
spacex,removed,no it will be forbidden until we get a mod team that is going to encourage open debate and free speech
spacex,removed,yeah but i mean hes quoting the reddit post verbatim so i am not reaching very far
spacex,removed,a bolt from the blue origin
spacex,removed,what where the sources of the post on reddit that god deleted
spacex,removed,would it have been deleted if named the reddit thread as his source
spacex,removed,in all this talk of sabotage i think its interesting to consider an alternate motive other than damaging spacexs reputation the satellite was built by israel aerospace industries and was going to be partially leased to facebook for lowcost internet access in africa moreover iais satellite subsidiary spacecom was to be sold to httpwwwdefensenewscomarticleslaunchpadblastdealssetbackopportunitiesforisraeliindustry and iai was going i havent found any followups to these stories since exploded i wonder what the impact is on iai and spacecom
spacex,removed,next time a leak at reddit gets removed i will repost it citing an anonymous source
spacex,removed,hes absolutely using the censored rspacex thread as his source how do we know for certain because for starters the way in which the articles author refers to the source he writes statements attributed to spacex founder elon musk if hed talked to someone who was there hed likely have written sources said or some other phrasing to indicate that an actual person hed communicated with had heard the words for definitive proof he writes in comments leaked just hours after a musk presentation well those comments were originally only leaked to only one place the censored rspacex thread as i predicted the censorship instituted by the rspacex mods did not keep the information from corporate competitors foreign powers or even domestic journalists that being the case what was the point of the censorship
spacex,removed,also with no sources here is some other information from the same theoretical anonymous source thread spacex employee confirmed that they literally hired a marksman and shoot a mockup second stage at long range
spacex,removed,so its unclear from where this information originated its actually quite clear imho that he was using the censored rspacex thread as his source how do we know because for starters the way in which the articles author refers to the source he writes statements attributed to spacex founder elon musk if hed talked to someone who was there hed likely have written sources said or some other phrasing to indicate that an actual person hed communicated with had heard the words for more definitive proof he writes in comments leaked just hours after a musk presentation well those comments were originally only leaked to only one place the censored rspacex thread this post edited to meet with moderator admonition
spacex,removed,apparently not my comment speculating about spacecom manufacturer and facebook leasee was deleted our comments are being carefully curated on this topic
spacex,removed,i kept thinking it was a dream did they actually shoot a mock
spacex,removed,so where is the full text of the nro talk that we are being childishly denied access to im at the tldr limits or enough already i expect this note will last a few milliseconds before deletion but why i am increasingly ceasing to care
spacex,removed,sure we can talk about the
spacex,removed,and theorize about possible motives but thats just a conspiracy theory one that spacex explicitly and realistically explored and investigated but yeah just a conspiracy theory lowlevel racism dafuq does race have to do with any of this before it leads to gross behavior now this is just getting weird
spacex,removed,so not sure why we are allowing the article but not the comments thats kinda what my original comment was driving at good question
spacex,removed,i assume humanity will unite behind planetary colonisation when it starts to become a reality with that in mind tin foil hats on before reading please new world order exists wants to keep humanity divided shoots the rocket to slow humanities unity
spacex,removed,does this include prices for seats on the its
spacex,removed,even if we put a flat earther on a rocket straight to the apollo landing sites they will just dismiss it it looks fake how do i know you didnt put props in the last minute to look like a set
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,two questions in what stage of development is the spacesuit in what stage of development is crew dragon
spacex,removed,i just imagine itll be like futurama where they turn into crappy tourist trap attractions with karts on a track
spacex,removed,whats your exact adress and which bedroom do you sleep in your house
spacex,removed,was i the only one expecting to see them offering a discount on launch services mildly disappointed lol
spacex,removed,its big fucking yeah
spacex,removed,the massive spacex pop booster has just completed its first suborbital flight test
spacex,removed,well i hope youre happ oh yeah thats what you said
spacex,removed,damn i thought this was rspacex not rroastme
spacex,removed,elon left to watch westworld
spacex,removed,its like when you save drafts of some paper thats due draft draft final draft finalfinal draft but with rockets
spacex,removed,i was expecting something a bit more substantial would have been nice
spacex,removed,heart of gold nice hitchhikers reference
spacex,removed,cant tell if this is a very random and obscure elite reference trump hate or just regular stupidity
spacex,removed,oh its gonna fun
spacex,removed,mars needs level super geniuses
spacex,removed,and make sure there arent any ula barges around
spacex,removed,fuck buzz aldrin and any opinions he may have dude lost any credibility when he started punching people he disagreed with
spacex,removed,alright whodunnit who mentioned ksp without inviting me come on
spacex,removed,spoileruhhh spoilers muchspoiler s

spacex,removed,why does your stuff keep breaking
spacex,removed,unplanned rapid disassembly
spacex,removed,will it have an infinite improbability drive
spacex,removed,big friendly rocket right
spacex,removed,no lol

spacex,removed,i am become mars god of war
spacex,removed,and also dead
spacex,removed,rest in pieces
spacex,removed,were not talking i dont even know you
spacex,removed,i prefer to think that there have really only been hardware iterations of the rocket to this point and that elons saying block just to fuck with us
spacex,removed,of course it would definitely be better for every life to be saved but maaaybeeee
spacex,removed,this guy
spacex,removed,evil villain confirmed
spacex,removed,what
spacex,removed,elon
spacex,removed,big future rocket
spacex,removed,i think he is talking about blue origin here
spacex,removed,but i want it now
spacex,removed,or the battlefield and xbox way and make it falcon
spacex,removed,yeah i hate people that like things too
spacex,removed,friends with a lot of ceos are we
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,armageddon here we come
spacex,removed,props on the name
spacex,removed,what proof do we have that it was even him answering
spacex,removed,trump isnt pro space anything and i hope spacex has given clinton a big enough bribe donation so she is if theyre sending a dozen people they dont need to cross ttain astronauts thats dumb train engineers and specialists to be astronauts and theyll do the job just as well and be specialized on top of that
spacex,removed,russians again damn those guys keep busy
spacex,removed,whoa
spacex,removed,wanna know whats funnier than
spacex,removed,can my cat ride the its
spacex,removed,wait youre not elon
spacex,removed,we might as well call it bar for big ass rocket
spacex,removed,i am one of them
spacex,removed,money is no longer absolute my friend
spacex,removed,same here lets just start a company or something

spacex,removed,im a bot bleep bloop
spacex,removed,i wish i could work at spacex i love rocket engines with a passion but im in no way qualified maybe they need more janitors
spacex,removed,gr vrc e v fcevrf e re
spacex,removed,thats the price to pay for fame with a subreddit keep that in mind going forward either donald trump or hillary clinton will be your president soon the same people that put both of them in that position are the same ones that are going to be doing what we consider shitposting here its a good problem to have if handled correctly thank you for your efforts
spacex,removed,teslas now made with space aluminumtm
spacex,removed,id be slightly worried as a botanist on mars wouldnt want to end up like mark watney you know
spacex,removed,well i got it the martian
spacex,removed,say that three times quickly
spacex,removed,vertical video no landing just kidding nice flight
spacex,removed,was waiting for that last whoooooooooo super low
spacex,removed,no your face
spacex,removed,wed also accept their insurance premiums are going to explode
spacex,removed,they dont have autocorrect on their systems
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,failing spectacularily level pro this dudes failures bring more discovery than most peoples successes could ever hope for i was really hoping it was sabotage though always makes for a better story onwards and upwards
spacex,removed,no your keyboard has a in chance of exploding on the launch pad when using the word in a comment
spacex,removed,cant they just keep a guy in the tank to hammer on the copv to stop build up im really just kidding
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit this weeks episode of south park had a brilliant ending that i think we can all agree with footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
spacex,removed,make nasa great again you know it makes sense
spacex,removed,we can only hope for a good presidency i fear he may focus to heavily on getting the usa economy back in order then space flight again hopefully he manages both
spacex,removed,doubt it they arent his buddies he despises wapo owned by bezos
spacex,removed,and who cares about planetary science probes
spacex,removed,spacexm not after musk said bad things about him on twitter hell go with boeing ula and blue origin
spacex,removed,especially because of his age he grew up and came of age when we were doing big shit with big rockets and so much national pride surrounded the apollo program if having cheeto supreme as president means we get a boost to nasa i think i can stomach the next years
spacex,removed,please support your argument with firsthand data or welldocumented quotes
spacex,removed,i think all we need to do is convince him we need to win space and the money will start flowing in tragically itll be from other areas such as cancer research and renewable energy so basically were going to win and still lose
spacex,removed,look i admire your optimism but its a bit rich to say that its foolish to believe what a candidate has said repeatedly also this httpswwwscientificamericancomarticletrumppickstopclimateskeptictoleadepatransition
spacex,removed,sarah palin is being considered to lead the department of the interior dontchaknow
spacex,removed,upside is yuge downside is yuge it could be tremendous either way
spacex,removed,there was a recent study that the feedback loop of global warming might be worse than thought dude global warming feedback is always worse than we thought except in the real world
spacex,removed,which political party is typically more concerned with environmental protection have you ever seen trump say something proscience or something about protecting the environment did you see his speech in west virginia where he mocked the idea that cfc propellants damaged the ozone
spacex,removed,hes not talking about total evacutaion hes making a reference to the americans that want to leave the country because of the election results implying soon we may be able to get even farther away from trumpland
spacex,removed,i dont think trump gives a shit about going to mars that wont make him any money he doesnt want people to admire him look at his behaviour he doesnt give a shit what people think
spacex,removed,i support the his expected appointee the epa has destroying the middle class its destroying destroying coal miners its destroying oil field jobs its destroying trucking jobs the epa has been holding back american businesses for far too long and its time for change
spacex,removed,everything is a dog whistle
spacex,removed,good
spacex,removed,if theyll let their families go hungry over partisan politics then fuck em
spacex,removed,im sort of reminded of the parody sarah palin as president in iron sky who kicked the movie off by returning to the moon you can see trump sort of liking the banners
spacex,removed,very very very generally he might be okay for spaceflight he is also an utterly inept racist mysogynistic politician who can largely be held responsible for a great deal of the dysfunction and lack of productivity in congress
spacex,removed,sarah palin is hot
spacex,removed,nasa is cleaver im sure they would love to test out some equipment in close orbit as a cost saving measure in case it fails on mars
spacex,removed,was rich pournelle named after jerry pournelle in the martian i do not think that i would mind people that andy weir thought deserved being in his book
spacex,removed,outsource to canada we are more than capable
spacex,removed,i will never not find that username amazing now i have the mental image of the two of you trying to destroy a rocket by beating on it with folding chairs like a bunch of wrestlers d
spacex,removed,this is of course not news per se but it can reduce the amount of echochamberingnutty speculation without stifling discussion
spacex,removed,hey i resent that accusation it hasnt happened more than once twice at the most
spacex,removed,the stream will actually be a series of faxes one page per frame
spacex,removed,yeah this is so delicious hope he eats his words
spacex,removed,thatd be a whole new way to make new dragons
spacex,removed,in the case of a president called donald trump elon musk would probably be too late with his attempt to backup humanity in case of an extinction event on earth like lets say a nuclear war
spacex,removed,tldr
spacex,removed,it would be a pity if those modifications were the reason for the rapture didnt realize that it had already occurred
spacex,removed,the journey of a couple million miles begins with a huge step
spacex,removed,nz quarantine is pretty strict it could be weeks
spacex,removed,as you said youre not a materials engineer
spacex,removed,im sorry i did not realize there was an easily accessible previous discussion about this no i was not ranting i was merely asking questions as i did not know about this i never said i was right i was merely asking for clarification on the logistics of the mission as it seemed to me at first to be a little off no need to be a complete douche bag
spacex,removed,rapture appropriate misspelling for a device designed to be lifted to the heavens
spacex,removed,well now you are adding an excavator
spacex,removed,environmental impact of possible disasters plus use of earth resources
spacex,removed,if theres mobey to be made doing so
spacex,removed,and well not being able to look away from the mesmerizing election dumpsterfire
spacex,removed,rspacex moderation policy question a sitting president states nasa sending humans to mars and referencing spacexs schedule is not suitable for this sub nbsp several people tried to post a link to this article mods said no this may need to be discussed and possibly clarified or modified btw tried to post this question as a normal rspacex post but it was rejected too nbsp in an oped published tuesday on cnn obama set a clear goal to send humans to mars by the and to have them return to earth safely with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time and writing for cnn obama pledges race to land on mars is on nbsp nasa is the singlelargest source of revenue for spacex and the closest technology partner by far this is likely to be true for a long while spacex and musk have the overarching goal of getting humans to mars becoming a multiplanetary species starting with mars while it is absolutely understood that we cannot have every vaguelyrelated nasa posttopic show up in this sub obamas humanstomars vision piece could be very influential in garnering additional support for spacexs mars efforts saying it is not relevant is like a gardening sub saying that a thread discussing the importance of a consistent source of water is not relevant nbsp what would elon gwynne or steve jurvetson say
spacex,removed,thanks obama
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,i think you are just being a debbie downer
spacex,removed,indeed doesnt look too bad nothing a hammer couldnt fix
spacex,removed,its a conspiracy
spacex,removed,got er all figured out good for you
spacex,removed,i cant wait for falcon heavy and new glenn
spacex,removed,i was kinda expecting under the first link
spacex,removed,a single crystal of aluminum uh wow
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,
spacex,removed,all of a sudden i have an itch to watch a how its made for falcon chinese detected
spacex,removed,unlike anything anyone has ever done before accurately describes musk industries
spacex,removed,what happened to the mars colonial transporter elon said it would be yuge
spacex,removed,how so if you look at pictures of apollo and orion capsules the docking windows are positioned at an angle different from the general shape of the capsule this indicates a different structure youre just being an asshole
spacex,removed,okay boss
spacex,removed,the answer is thrusters
spacex,removed,but muh spaculation
spacex,removed,exactly its not a big deal
spacex,removed,red dragon will plunge deep into the flight wiki link
spacex,removed,holy shit its an actual energy shield
spacex,removed,oooooooooh magic
spacex,removed,i see the north koreans going before sls lol
spacex,removed,ill place my bet at mariachi bands
spacex,removed,they havent seized production we must await the revolution
spacex,removed,lol thanks for the laugh the only way boeing is going to beat spacex there is if they steal the ict planssoftware a la lockheed and simultaneously sabotage spacexs launches
spacex,removed,if they dropped it dozens of rspacexers would throw themselves underneath it
spacex,removed,my secret eightball
spacex,removed,so thats where is headed
spacex,removed,maybe if they stopped putting so much effort into killing people from far away
spacex,removed,just use a blimp
spacex,removed,laughably false
spacex,removed,johnny depps estranged wife amber heard and spacex billionaire elon musk are definitely not having sex right this second on a sustainable lion pelt — it died of natural causes lion cancer actually very sad — on the floor of a french chateau that spacex billionaire elon musk just sold today the day he put it on the market because he accurately gauged market interest lmao
spacex,removed,boeing doesnt have to prepare too much when they can take out a rocket on the launch pad during a fueling test with a caliber barratt rifle from a rooftop about a mile away
spacex,removed,well when they get there they will be just in time to buy gifts in the spacex gift shop
spacex,removed,you mean spellitician and grammar artist right
spacex,removed,my money is on aliens or johnny depp
spacex,removed,vows twwww is he in it for the money or on what motive
spacex,removed,hold steady mr musk httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvamwlafqnwve
spacex,removed,holy moly imagine that thing blowing up some day
spacex,removed,has some great theories i bet he is talking about johnny depps estranged wife amber heard and spacex billionaire elon musk
spacex,removed,very amusing i know thats a lacklustre response but i just cant muster the energy to do any better the whole article was just more boeing blah blah blah bs
spacex,removed,european model is hot
spacex,removed,joe biden
spacex,removed,the journalist had made an order at the context store but they had run out
spacex,removed,their architecture is a fucking joke its literally designed to be as expensive as possible so they can pork out
spacex,removed,the american government assassinate people as well
spacex,removed,if
spacex,removed,dont you dare touch my tinfoil hat
spacex,removed,i think he really just wanted to let everyone know that hes gettin some
spacex,removed,wait a few years ago washington post was bought by some guy whats his name again
spacex,removed,so you are leaving johnny depp as more likely interesting
spacex,removed,but hey this is rspacex and we do the heavy thinking i love your charitable description of our process
spacex,removed,youd think they would have subtler methods of attaining their goals besides blowing shit up
spacex,removed,if you are going there perhaps it was to enhance one of the httpswwwiqtorg stocks
spacex,removed,worryingly there is a conspiracy theory that the titanic was intentionally sunk by jp morgan to remove his rivals who were on board
spacex,removed,its also well known that the russians are some of the best at it maybe only behind israel
spacex,removed,note wapo is owned by jeff bezos
spacex,removed,i think the sound distance analysis came from you and it matched the smarf building as a possible origin for a bullet quite well taken that and the sudden occurrence of the incident the fact that no apparent heat source was in the installation and the very bright glow in the first picture frame of the explosion i think sabotage matches these facts quite well that would be enough to win a murder case for a state attorney but maybe without direct proof not enough as allegation in this case
spacex,removed,its definitely aliuns is built by an israeli company which the freemasons once resided in israeli after leaving egypt having been forced to build the pyramids as power stations for the aliuns was the first in a constellation of satellites that contained a top secret payload that can disable aliun guidance and propulsion systems which would allow the freemasons to steal their technology take over the world use the combined might of earths industrial base to build an interstellar fleet to enslave the aliuns home planet and force them to build pyramids to generate power so the freemasons can fulfill their thousands of year old pledge to take over the galaxy or maybe its a failure in the helium system i dont they both seem like pretty reasonable explanations
spacex,removed,what about people who do not like the satellite owner surely no one in the world dislikes isreal right
spacex,removed,wait the article left out the chinese who have the same motives as the russians plus the destruction of the amos satellite has direct bearing on their deal with israel satellite industries and how about anyone who hate the israelis no conspiracy theory is complete without an arab israel angle
spacex,removed,yeah i mean weve all seen contact amirite
spacex,removed,or just an advanced negotiation technique to be able to buy spacecom on the cheap tinfoil hat on of course

spacex,removed,it totally is appropriate to shut down people who say so because we have no reason to be speculating along those lines with any serious thought to it its distracting and we have no evidence on which to base an investigation if there were anything to investigate we are not accident investigators we are armchair spectators speculating is what we do and even if we were accident investigators apparently they actually are investigating this possibility or were investigating it at one point you are just being boring and unimaginative and trying to ruin everyones fun for no reason from what i can tell you also have a very poor understanding of the creative process and its value why dont you just lighten up and enjoy yourself youre just suggesting something external to spacex that you could blame for the failure see you are not stranger to the process of speculation and unfounded accusation this isnt such a hard thing to understand
spacex,removed,you could rename it firefly and sell to nathan fillion

spacex,removed,return to launch site where the falcon lands on solid ground vs a barge landing
spacex,removed,return to launch site i think
spacex,removed,return to launch site as opposed to landing on the drone ship
spacex,removed,rtls is return to launch site thats what they call land landings essentially
spacex,removed,i believe it stands for return to launch site the first stage attempts to land near where it took off hope this helps
spacex,removed,obvious ufo top left part of the photo
spacex,removed,return to launch site
spacex,removed,return to launch site
spacex,removed,well done spacex keep up the good work

spacex,removed,read arrg i want my patches dammit stop being wussies and release something trivial from the worst failure you have ever suffered
spacex,removed,we need a falcon heavy delayedbot you have mentioned falcon heavy and delayed its launch by month the new launch date is december
spacex,removed,too soon too soon
spacex,removed,heeeeeey so we found these things in the scrap yard and wanted to cut some costs mind if we deliver your cargo in them

spacex,removed,duh either the ducksized horses would melt under a merlin or the would outdrag the horsesized duck either way he wins easily and the question is irrelevant
spacex,removed,i recognize this will be either amusing or unpopular as hell butit seems just disappointingly feasible enough that i hope to defuse and dissuade such through satire we need to start a twitter movement to get the elon of mars here everyone hashtag likehashtag stuffand send messages like we but what about turtles in and organize so we can lay in the spacex parking lot in july as protest for decisions that havent been made yet they have to oryknow could just send emails to whatever public pr email account they have and ask nicely suspect the elon of mars would like some technical questions and be annoyed about potentially violating itar with every damned answer also why just the elon cmon theres actual engineers here not just my dumb ass how about some heavilymoderated chitchat with mueller or the hans or an opportunity to ask shotwell if shes ever considered keeping a pint of decent bourbon in her desk drawer instead of me just joking about it on here all these people whether they like or believe in it or not are friggin role models heck past and present employees are too seems to me we need to nurture and broaden our horizons and im still asking about the failure of the antidroneship rocket system here or on iama
spacex,removed,wait uechologic has more replies than anyone even famous people like obama or jeff bozos
spacex,removed,so we just need to make sure we are fast with the up votes and link the post here to rspacex before it gets deleted then message the mods like crazy to undelete it

spacex,removed,jesus elon is looks younger today
spacex,removed,echo elon
spacex,removed,yes
spacex,removed,why dont you have a massive robot arm catch the rocket what pacific rim wasnt real
spacex,removed,anyone hear the opening credits from space balls going through their heads by about the third or fourth watch
spacex,removed,echologic is elon
spacex,removed,just install mechjeb
spacex,removed,aww sorry uechologic and our other aunz members looks like they didnt turn one of the socks upside down for you like they did last time
spacex,removed,elon did you like the boots i sold you
spacex,removed,looking at your history youre on a string of really bad and dumb comments lately something going on amigo
spacex,removed,its interesting reading the replies to this comment its a real study in human nature key themes being us vs them were superior we dont like their rules it seems clear that once a group of people reaches a critical mass the inefficiencies of beurocracy the loss of self criticism even xenophobia are born out and then quality declines ironic but thats why spacex exists because the same thing happened to nasa thats why civilisations rise and fall and reddit groups turn to shit thats why asimov wrote foundation recommend it to you all
spacex,removed,echo is famous for having inside information and we asked him how he gets it he replied that elon faxes him all his information directly
spacex,removed,gate guardian is the proper term
spacex,removed,basically small hadrosaurs terrifying
spacex,removed,lko wrong subreddit

spacex,not_removed,its not and they talk about new stuff the iridium landing zone
spacex,not_removed,its not and they talk about new stuff the iridium landing zone agree and its very easy to confuse the two documents adoption of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact for boostback and landing of the falcon full thrust first stage at west at vandenberg air force base california and offshore landing contingency option signed october and covers landings at the new concrete landing pad at vandenberg and also landing on an asds droneship no less than miles offshore of vafb adoption of the supplemental environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact for boostback and landing of the falcon full thrust first stage at iridium landing area vandenberg air force base california and offshore landing contingency option signed november and adds landing on an asds droneship in a different area called the iridium landing area which is particularly suitable for launches with heavy payloads from the description the iridium landing area appears to be several hundred miles south of vandenberg in both documents the finding was for no significant impact which means that a full environmental impact assessment is not necessary good news can we assume that iridium refers to the iridium satellite launches
spacex,not_removed,nothing beyond the footage from the support ship that cuts out before the rud
spacex,not_removed,k thanks man
spacex,not_removed,ill be at iac presenting my work on martian greenhouses i have every finger crossed that elon might even pop in to watch my presentation
spacex,not_removed,idea the predictions thread should have some requiredencouraged points like liftoff mass and vehicle height so we can look at some histograms of guesses and see how they compare to the actual values
spacex,not_removed,i love this sub when i start feeling depressed about the state of affairs in the world i come here and see awesomeness such as this thread and the future seems much less bleak so excited for september
spacex,not_removed,hey mods i live in guadalajara but probably wont be able to pony up the cash for the conference any chance i could lurk in the meetup
spacex,not_removed,looks like elon musk may be giving a second talk called making humans a multiplanetary species also possible that this is the main spacex keynote not clear full text from the email dear iac participants the international astronautical congress to be held in guadalajara mexico from september will welcome spacex founder ceo and lead designer elon musk on the second day of the iac during a special keynote entitled making humans a multiplanetary species musk will discuss the longterm technical challenges that need to be solved to support the creation of a permanent selfsustaining human presence on mars the technical presentation will focus on potential architectures for colonizing the red planet that industry government and the scientific community can collaborate on in the years ahead
spacex,not_removed,my official prediction is that this sub will get kind of crazy for the next daysgrin more seriously where do we make suggestions for the predictions thread eg method of entry types of entry method of filtering for duplicate entries etc
spacex,not_removed,wonderful wonderful writeup to all involved thank you for your time and hard work i am also planning on attending in person by the way
spacex,not_removed,looks like spacex will be talking before blue origin i predict spacex knocking it out of the park with their conference i hope bo doesnt feel that overshadowed after blue origin the mars sample return through human and robotic collaboration looks interesting fortunately for us europeans the majority of the conference is in the afternoon evening
spacex,not_removed,maybe spacex mission patches as prizes for predictions they arent expensive but pretty cool
spacex,not_removed,musk just confirmed the new name will be interplanetary transport system its in a tweet heres the original he later replied to someone confirming that is the official new name
spacex,not_removed,i rarely contribute to this subreddit but it is always an intense joy to read the indepth discussions and prognostication looking forward to the announcement great times ahead
spacex,not_removed,i love how the admins had to modify the title via css because its not possible with reddit thats serious dedication
spacex,not_removed,at days i wish al traveller a safe trip and enjoy possibly the most important speech regarding making humanity multi planetary enjoy the speech by watching elon not in a viewfinder of a camera but live with your own eyes seizing the moment we all will be watching it on the internet godspeed you all
spacex,not_removed,i cannot wait to hear a solemn and serious newscaster forced to give a report on the big fucking rocket
spacex,not_removed,wondering if this will impact all of the bfrmct announcement or just part of it with raptor testing
spacex,not_removed,fwiw i emailed the iaf media people via the website asking if the two apparently different presentations were in fact the same and they confirmed there is only one presentation but didnt expand on which version is to be expected my email hi is this speech by elon musk late breaking news colonizing mars – a deep technical presentation on the space transport architecture needed to colonize mars spacex late breaking tuesday september – location guadalajara room the same as this news article also on your site making humans a multiplanetary species the international astronautical congress to be held in guadalajara mexico from september will welcome spacex founder ceo and lead designer elon musk on the second day of the iac during a special keynote entitled making humans a multiplanetary species musk will discuss the longterm technical challenges that need to be solved to support the creation of a permanent selfsustaining human presence on mars the technical presentation will focus on potential architectures for colonizing the red planet that industry government and the scientific community can collaborate on in the years ahead or does he speak twice their reply was dear daron yes it is kind regards iaf media so i guess we know its still about mars in any case

spacex,not_removed,predictions thread toplevel comments will be restricted to predictions and well be making a spreadsheettable internally to keep track of them theres no winner per se but days after the iac mars architecture announcement well revisit these predictions to see how we did and who faired the best perhaps we can have prizes make us a recommendation google forms would be perfect to collect orderedstandardized guesses and it would give you pointshighscores in a second once we enter the real data to compare to im doing a sketch later and send it over to you hope it will convince you p im also offering a tshirt or some gold for any winnerwinners user list stolen shamelessly from utheblacktom thank you fyi here is one extra person i added yesterday httpswwwredditcomrspacexwikicommunity also interesting question is if there will be an official livestream the post above doesnt mention it and so far i received official replies in emails about this stated they havent decided yet said there will be no livestream
spacex,not_removed,im hoping well get a we choose to go to mars type speech a la jfk
spacex,not_removed,you should add a link to a to the table of events maybe somewhere on the days row to reduce everyones confusion regarding time zones etc
spacex,not_removed,an interesting coincidence spacex representatives are going to be on my schools campus after the announcement to talk to seniors and project teams about internships i will be going and listening to as many of their talks as i can and see if i cant talk to any of them personally
spacex,not_removed,well my plane ticket is bought and ill be going to iac never been so stoked for anything before as a student who has never been out of the country before this will be quite an adventure and the most fascinating thing ill have ever seen
spacex,not_removed,hi mods can you make new the default ordering in the weekly discussion threads
spacex,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvndpxufujhe
spacex,not_removed,question request mr musk what was the starting point for designing the architecture did you arbitrarily pick tonnes to mars and work back from there or did you decide on the bfr size and work forward or words to that effect im fascinated by how these things get decided given the almost limitless modes that could be used the sls seems to be based on rehashing the shuttle components then later on designing some sort of mission based on it truly the worst way to do it robert zubrin asserts that the day mars plan was based on giving every nasa department a slice of the action regardless of the complexity
spacex,not_removed,thanks to whoever seems to have gilded all the predictions comments
spacex,not_removed,i think there will many types of predictions perhaps they could be grouped appropriately the physical architecture of the bfrmct lots of this already funding will there be a crowd funded element to some of this will it all be from elons pocket tv rights who will be participating just space x nasa others usrow time scales to first man on mars the first colonist the first million on mars supporting developments isru habitats rovers communications food production etc
spacex,not_removed,so is echo making a diversion to hawthorne while in la maybe they can sneak the non us person into a tour
spacex,not_removed,hi i am going as a tech journalist for a small newspaper in chile
spacex,not_removed,my official prediction is that they will announce their mars plans d seriously though holy shit it somehow didnt occur to me until now how close we are to actually getting the details we want
spacex,not_removed,great thread however guadalajara is misspelt in the when and where section of the faq please feel free to delete comment after fix
spacex,not_removed,just throwing this out there even though most of my predictions are really just taking what i think are the best of other peoples guesses so i dont really deserve to win bfr name something bird of preyrelated eg osprey hawk harrier or owl height around diameter shape relatively short and squat compared to engines raptors operation launch from brand new site in texas always rtls landing on legs folding out from underneath mct name eagle or possibly red eagle referencing apollo lm engines raptors shape capsule similar to scaledup crew dragon variants mars cargo leo tanker and mars crew landings capable of propulsive landings on mars and earth general operation launch tanker eagle to leo fuel tanks almost dry upon arrival launch more tanker eagles to leo rendezvous with first refill tanks on first launch crew eagle to rendezvous with first tanker eagle in leo transfer fuel first few missions will launch crew later on crew dragons eventually move to crew being onboard crew eagle at launch crew eagle departs for mars uses multiple aerocapture passes through atmosphere before accurate landing prelanded cargo and empty crew eagle at landing site on mars empty crew eagle has refilled using isru ready for immediate departure in an emergency all eagle variants carry isru equipment capable of autonomous sste from mars surface power solar desire for nuclear but wont happen any time soon general predictions spacex will need a lot of help both tech and funding to make this work they can probably do the bfr alone but not the mct too much tech to be developed reliable long term life support food toilets water reclamation radiation shielding isru etc the iac talk will describe the bfr and mct the operations flow etc musk will ask for the whole scientific academic and government community to help to develop the tech needed provide the funds etc a lot of things need to fall perfectly in line for this to happen the next us president has to be supportive as do congress spacex will have to walk a fine political line which probably means finding a role for sls at least for the next years eg prelanding supplies habitats rovers etc spacex wont position themselves as a sole supplier of the mars architecture but simply the human cargo transportation element they have to leave room for others to take part and theyll want to and we all should too it makes it more sustainable spacex will start shopping around after iac for a site to build and launch the mars vehicles theyll hunt for tax breaks etc from the likes of texas georgia and florida i think theyll eventually go for texas due to proximity to their other sites engines avionics etc will be built in hawthorne tankage etc will be built at the launch site depending on political support etc i think this is doable within years first crewed landing in the real world more like the time for testing a year mission cycle is too great apollo could test a full mission duration in weeks then improve the next incremental step and send it up for testing within months thats how they could achieve their goal in less than a decade schedule first test launchlanding of bfr first test launchlanding of boilerplate mct propulsion gn not much else to leo possibly suborbital first test launchlanding of boilerplate mct and tanker mct to test refuelling in leo first test launchlanding of crewcapable ie with life support etc but uncrewed mct to leo possible leo refuel and lunar flyby to test highspeed reentry first launch of dress rehearsal complete test mission of empty crewcapable mct refuelling in leo transit to mars mars edl isru earth return in first launch of empty crewcapable mct to mars to refuel via isru await crew on surface first launch of crewed mars mission crewed mct launches from earth lands near uncrewed refuelled mct on mars from launch first crewed mars landing first crew return from mars probably in mct from launch
spacex,not_removed,ticket flight and lodging acquired for the whole week check the shadows at the iac ill likely be lurking in them mod summon uechologic
spacex,not_removed,pulled the trigger but ill be there just for the add me to the rspacex going list mod summon uzucal edit maybe we should do an rspacex breakfast then try to go get good seats for the presentation what are the odds elon agrees to a photo with all the rspacex attendees someone make that happen
spacex,not_removed,considering that the thread had been up days would it make sense to fire up a new one with a more accurate daycount were almost halfway to the day thats stickied as perpetually days out
spacex,not_removed,as requested the weekly discussion threads are now sorted by new
spacex,not_removed,i think we should start a year long campaign to convince bezos to do a full reveal on blue origins interplanetary architecture at iac since it is in adelaide which is a bit more accessible than mexico for me
spacex,not_removed,hey guys sometime within the next month im going to get to take a private tour of the spacex headquarters in hawthorne california ill be asking questions and looking out for falcon heavy and maybe even bfrmct hardware and possible dragon dragon hardware and remembering every detail if you guys have any ideas of what this sub would like me to be on the lookout for or any questions you would like me to ask if my guide would even know the answers lemme know i will post a follow up post sometime later after i get back in order to make sure to keep my guide anonymous
spacex,not_removed,hi all im rather new to reddit and have mostly been reading rspacex so far just registered to participate in the discussion sorry in advance for any newbie mistakes im going to iac as well eagerly looking forward to elons presentation will be there for the whole week planning to attend the majority of other iac events as well there isnt an iac attendee thread yet is there it would be nice to meetup and perhaps do some tours around guadalajara in the free time if anyones up for it mod summon uzucal
spacex,not_removed,some are suggesting that spacex will delay the announcement but that would seem to contradict this tweet check out novaroads tweet i think if there is any way for them to make an announcement they will do so
spacex,not_removed,sept iridium next was supposed to fly today
spacex,not_removed,how much are tickets for the conference i fly for free and it looks like there are some good rated hostels so if i can get the time off and permission from the fiancé i would like to go
spacex,not_removed,so im considering going to iac but i have a couple of questions first of all is it too late to order second is the student price available to all students or only those who are studying relevant subjects
spacex,not_removed,note the addition of the rspacex iac meetup details thread at days in the overview table
spacex,not_removed,for anyone wanting a headsup on what is probably the technical foundation for the first manned missions read the case for mars by robert zubrin the scientific explanation of alone is worth it
spacex,not_removed,its folks already half the time has past since the start of this thread
spacex,not_removed,i am a mechanical engineering student in guadalajara also attending iac
spacex,not_removed,orbital atk published this video today
spacex,not_removed,perhaps we can have prizes make us a recommendation ill give a month gold to whoever is closest specwise percent not absolute relying on the mod team to take down this info though edit mods you up for this specs like this would be good
spacex,not_removed,for all interested here is a pretty thorough examination of the iacs there are some extraordinarily exciting topics to be discussed
spacex,not_removed,does any one know whether this event andor indvidual präsentations will be streamed
spacex,not_removed,is it the predictions thread today
spacex,not_removed,uechologic mexican going to iac
spacex,not_removed,i come to the sub pretty often and would love to hear about this from you guys im a massive supporter of space exploration so i want to be clear i want this mission to happen with that said im curious how they will make profit from it with reusable boosters its clear how elon musk is able to advance his scientific ambitions while keeping his company running but i cant for the life of me figure out the plan for mars in this regard can anyone weigh in is the company just prepared to take a loss on this mission
spacex,not_removed,uzucal httpswwwtimeanddatecomtimezonescdt so utc time should be
spacex,not_removed,hyypppeee okay but seriously this is going to be awesome i cant wait for it
spacex,not_removed,i had a dream about the mct architecture unveiling last night it was super cool and hopefully some aspect of it may have even been remotely accurate

spacex,not_removed,im so tempted to take annual leave and worry about ticket money afterwards
spacex,not_removed,oh my god i just realized that the mars architecture announcement is the day after my birthday what a great belated birthday present
spacex,not_removed,i think itd be good to insert a link to the crowdfunding thread on the overview table uzucal same later on once the other threads start showing up to make this the overview megathread also link back to this thread here from the other ones
spacex,not_removed,hey uechologic i think you forgot to update spacexstatscom p
spacex,not_removed,good dayafternoonnight im from mexico city i study industrial engineering and i want to go to iac but first because i dont want to spend my money unwisely i want to ask a question if i go to iac will i be able to assist mr elon musks presentation
spacex,not_removed,it would be good if this thread had the date of iac somewhere handy i knew it once but i have forgotten
spacex,not_removed,a friend of mine who literally lurks this sub over the shoulder will be going and wants to meet yall
spacex,not_removed,heads up tomorrow sep days is the last day to rsvp for the meetup and register your attendance here
spacex,not_removed,still going and bringing a recent convert with me d
spacex,not_removed,echo is busy packing page zucal instead guys d
spacex,not_removed,so whats the consensus will we get a preliminary cause of rud as a prelude to the talk in the few days left leading up to it at some point after
spacex,not_removed,holy guacamole im attending iac but im too late to rsvp for this
spacex,not_removed,as some of you may know i usually restream any rocket launch i can catch mainly spacex with real time commentary and spanish translation this time its a bit different d httpsyoutubegntiuwsmk
spacex,not_removed,can the body of this post can be updated with links to the and the
spacex,not_removed,im really excited for mars and fh and all wont be able to attend the meeting personally but its very pleasing to see that people meet for such events
spacex,not_removed,has elon done similar talks for spacex or his other ventures not to poohpooh the event too much but it seems like minutes is just too short of a talk to warrant this hype
spacex,not_removed,this might be better suited for rhighstakesspacex given that testing of raptor components began at the start of how soon do we think raptor might be completed
spacex,not_removed,i am seriously considering travelling to guadalajara to attend the iac and elons presentation id like to know if theres any people from the netherlands also going it would be useful to compare schedules and other data mod summon uechologic
spacex,not_removed,i will be attending iac paging uechologic zucal sorry
spacex,not_removed,ill be there as well paging uechologic
spacex,not_removed,so question about the long term habitat on mars is a pressurized dome at all feasible i feel like long term thats ultimately going to be what needs to happen rather than living in a couple hundred standalone mct type deals on mars to actually have a city with eventually a million people the actually structure and layout of the city is going to be interesting
spacex,not_removed,im probably not going to be able to join the stream until at least minutes or so after it starts can you skip back to the start of a youtube stream while its still streaming
spacex,not_removed,you can modify post titles now
spacex,not_removed,great post nice to see the whole plan laid out looking forward to the event
spacex,not_removed,i assume the users who will go will take a recording device and record the whole presentation
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,the real prize for guessing the mct architecture should be something awesome i am thinking a tour of hawthorne some space x employee should be able to hook us up
spacex,not_removed,i just noticed that i will sit in a plane without internet on the way from jakarta to istanbul during elons presentation hopefully i will find a good video of the event in the media thread when i have the layover in istanbul
spacex,not_removed,i was not planning on attending iac but now that i know elon is presenting i really want to what are the chances that elon only talks about whats required to build an mct and get to mars without actually revealing the design or major details of the mct similar to how we heard about the technical and economical requirements for the model long before the actual design release i cant swing the full week but id go just for the presentation if its going to be as big as we think it is
spacex,not_removed,given that we know bfr is too big for transportation on public roads and that ksc pad wont support it can we assume the rocket will be manufactured and flown from boca chica i guess they could still build it in hawthorne and ship it to boca chica through the panama canal
spacex,not_removed,offered to queue without water or food dont forget to pack powerbars and bottled waters hours travel time yikes i like the caribbean tour plan over that even though there is little better than ambien on the midnight flight
spacex,not_removed,hi mods thanks for the predictions thread lots of fun until far too late at night can you sticky it please for visibility
spacex,not_removed,hey mods you should replace predictions thread in the list up there with the actual link to the post
spacex,not_removed,hello everybody ive thought wether it would be possible to repurpose the lox tank on the its to living quarters during mars transit of course the lox would need to be split into tanks so there is storage for the landing burn but it might be a good idea once you have a hundred people on board there is also the problem of organic contamination but that could be handled
spacex,not_removed,shit im gonna be away with limited internet access when it happens ill still have my phone though
spacex,not_removed,im going to the iac as well
spacex,not_removed,ill be at the iac arrive late on monday and will be there through friday paging uechologic thanks
spacex,not_removed,ill be attending iac
spacex,not_removed,uechologic ill be attending the iac looking forward to joining you at the meetup
spacex,not_removed,another mexican going to iac mod summon uzucal
spacex,not_removed,i am attending the iac if it isnt too late to register here uzucal
spacex,not_removed,so how does the video stream work when theres like presentations all at the same time are we gonna be able to go back and watch them all
spacex,not_removed,i was wondering if theres going to be a timely posted video for the presentation because i cant watch it live exam if you know of one could you please provide the link
spacex,not_removed,question besides the official iac stream are there any other live streams thanks
spacex,not_removed,if anyone missed it i updated the album with a simple model of bfrmctitswhatever based on the median votes on dimensions in less than days we will see how close we got
spacex,not_removed,httpwwwscientificamericancomarticlespacexfoundersettounveilhumanstomarsplaninseptember by scientific american of spacex mars things starting with the announcement and talking about red dragon raptor etc
spacex,not_removed,will this post be unstickied when the next post is made
spacex,not_removed,its days now i guess were waiting to calm down after the launchlanding before posing the crowdfunding campaign
spacex,not_removed,i noticed that this post doesnt have the flair marsiac instead having modpost so it doesnt come up when that curation is searched for could this be amended or does reddit only allow one flair on a post
spacex,not_removed,will elons presentation be officially live streamed by the iac event organisers or by spacex or will we be relying on periscope streams from the audience
spacex,not_removed,perhaps it would be good to update the use of the crowdfunding campaign funds up top uzucal
spacex,not_removed,the quantitative part doesnt work in the prediction post
spacex,not_removed,official announcement of livestream link to livestream this could be added to the links above or obviously the day thread
spacex,not_removed,is there going to be a weekly discussion thread
spacex,not_removed,kinda confused im located in mountain time what time will ill be able to live stream it
spacex,not_removed,so right now there is the heads of agency panel are we suppose to discuss that here assuming anything interesting is said or somewhere else musks presentation is the headliner but its possible some good info comes out of these opening acts
spacex,not_removed,is there any way to watch the livestream without installing flash
spacex,not_removed,hey mods what about the predictions revisited thread
spacex,not_removed,im so hyped and so disappointed at the same time hyped because space exploration ftw but disappointed because mars is a poor choice for mankinds next step and its all elon musk has in mind my dream since before i even heard of elon musk was to do what he does but now its too late im only i guess im born years too early after all
spacex,not_removed,going on elon time were days out
spacex,not_removed,does anyone have a spare hapoy to pay more than the thanks
spacex,not_removed,has anyone heard if the mars announcement will be postponed due to this months failure
spacex,not_removed,man i would love to attend this
spacex,not_removed,crowdfunding campaign mods soliciting money is not really appropriate the simply ask is would any other user be allowed to do this if not then mods shouldnt either
spacex,not_removed,nice do you have a paper or any other literature youve written on the subject i could read
spacex,not_removed,tweet him to let him know
spacex,not_removed,hm there are certainly some chances there is probably one billionaire whose number one goal is to build greenhouses on mars and coincidentally it is elon good luck with the prez
spacex,not_removed,so youre further from the sun but theres a lot less atmosphere between you and the sunlong story short would a structure designed to trap heat on mars trap more or less heat than it would on the surface of the earth at sea level assuming both are about equitorial
spacex,not_removed,try to talk to him there and ask him if he has timeinterest to see it
spacex,not_removed,i want to know more about this closed ecological systems have been a huge interest of mine but i never got the chance to study them in school do you have recommendations for papers and books on the topic ive got a graduate background in biology so hit me with as technical as you can get
spacex,not_removed,just want to say i appreciate the immense effort you guys put in this sub
spacex,not_removed,cheers this means the hard work is over right right
spacex,not_removed,seriously you mods are amazing i love the organization and all the work being put into this i know weve said this before but ill say it again this is by far the best run sub on reddit always high quality stuff
spacex,not_removed,i want to join spacex slack any chance we can open it up
spacex,not_removed,should have come through sfo instead of lax have a great trip man
spacex,not_removed,liftoff mass vehicle height number of launches per trip number of raptors on first stage transit time and some other ones would be really cool to see across the subreddit in the predictions thread
spacex,not_removed,my idea using google forms its ideal for fixed questions however not best for individual predictions sent it to the mods lets see if they would like it note only demo questions yet
spacex,not_removed,im interested in seeing what internal volume of the living space will be
spacex,not_removed,so true
spacex,not_removed,there is not much going on in the world that is good space x is almost it
spacex,not_removed,we havent exactly organized anything but anyone on this subreddit is welcome
spacex,not_removed,you can accompany someone for im sure someone would love to have someone who knows the city too
spacex,not_removed,id be happy to have you as an accompaniment for
spacex,not_removed,you should organize something
spacex,not_removed,im not saying that you have to do it but it would be cool if you could take some pictures or even videos on all your trip there from start to end and not only the conference itself maybe uthevehicledestroyer and all the others going there could do that too this way we that cant go there can feel what it is like to be there thank you edit typos
spacex,not_removed,nervous about a cancelation or have they confirmed its still on i would assume at this point elon would have given them the courtesy of canceling if he planned to do so
spacex,not_removed,got the same email very confused edit its worth noting the second day of the conference is september ie the day the original presentation was scheduled to take place
spacex,not_removed,the big question is whether this replaces or merely is in addition to the prior planned talk if the former this is exceedingly bad news the latter perhaps this will be a more publicfacing and accessible version of the talk we have all been waiting for either way any talk is better than nothing but i would definitely prefer the more technical one
spacex,not_removed,day colonizing mars – a deep technical presentation on the space transport architecture needed to colonize mars day focus on potential architectures for colonizing the red planet that industry government and the scientific community can collaborate on i dont know what to make of this on day i think he is going to reveal what spacex plans to build the bfrmct launch recovery landing and orbital refueling details to get a human mission to mars by on day he might reveal what canwillshould be done by others there is plenty of work for robots and probes and rovers and equipment that works on mars instead of building and flying a refueling tanker perhaps another country ahem russia wants to step up and build an orbital methalox depot and figure out the whole cryogenic transfer onorbit
spacex,not_removed,just wait until after the conference with concrete facts there should be lots and lots of speculation after that
spacex,not_removed,more seriously where do we make suggestions for the predictions thread eg method of entry types of entry method of filtering fr duplicate entries etc right here or message the moderators
spacex,not_removed,added
spacex,not_removed,i really want to hear what bezos has to say immediately after also do you think blue blue origin prefers being abbreviated to blue rather than bodyodor haha will make any big announcement of their own or are they sort of just going to say what they will and let spacex dominate the news spotlight for a while before talking about their stuff also midwriting that i remembered blue origin generally says nothing about anything ever i guess all i can hope for is bezos being happy about ithes a space geek too and wants a colony on mars too we dont need another twitter fight
spacex,not_removed,i hope bo doesnt feel that overshadowed i actually have this fantasy that jeff bezos in the news today as now being the richest person on the planet will be so inspired that hell chuck a few billion to spacex for bfrmct funding
spacex,not_removed,maybe a special flair for the top guess
spacex,not_removed,i second this
spacex,not_removed,we could perhaps allow people to post their own prizes in it im offering one baseball cap to the person who gets closest on the first stage thrust the only issue there would be that mods would have to be well assured that theyd actually send the prizes out so it would be limited to very senior accounts or people that send us some real proof in advance
spacex,not_removed,color me skeptical i think hes just adopted a new additional codenamenickname real name will come later or at the iac maybe
spacex,not_removed,yes and all posts realted to this are being deleted i don´t know why seems like quite big news for a community which came to love the mct its now
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomelonmusk preview of the spacex interplanetary transport system at httpstwittercomelonmusk thescalex spacex youtube its it is this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,ha thats what happened came here expecting a new thread then got confused edit spelling
spacex,not_removed,nice catch and kudos for that css hat trick
spacex,not_removed,unfortunately css isnt able to change the pages title tag though
spacex,not_removed,uechologic you should continue to update this daily for the remaining few days
spacex,not_removed,its the big frendly rocket p
spacex,not_removed,they can always call it the big falcon rocket
spacex,not_removed,i am betting musk will refer to it as mct stage or something equally boring and most of the press will forget all about the original very cool name
spacex,not_removed,im affraid this may be the most important message of this thread
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercommaximeputeaux spacex shotwell announcement of the use of raptor engine the late september iacmexico possibly delayed wsbw euroconsultec this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,i really doubt it spacex is going to lay out the entire plan i hope so anyways
spacex,not_removed,i was thinking about this last night and i think its probably a good thing the presentation has taken a broader scope i think it means they know exactly what they need in addition to their own contributions and are going to make a case for others in the industry to do their part hell present what spacex has been working onis going to work on transportation isru space suits etc and then hell say paraphrasing here is what else we need for a successful colony we will work with others in the industry to integrate their parts and when all is said and done we can do the entire thing for x amount of dollars if we can do this nasa and other space agencies should be able to easily afford to contract us
spacex,not_removed,yes it is seriously that was their response it must be deliberately vague nonanswer wtf
spacex,not_removed,so another deadline shifts thats disappointing
spacex,not_removed,well this is bad news now we just need to hope the content of the speech did not change from its original plans
spacex,not_removed,pretty sure literally speaking they are saying yes it is the same conference and yes he is speaking twice andor covering all of these topics is this speech by elon muskthe same as this news article yes it is
spacex,not_removed,the colonizing mars may have just been a place holder title the description for making humans a multiplanetary species also includes a technical presentation on architecture for colonizing mars
spacex,not_removed,so good somebody put this in the main body of text above calendar item set for sydney now
spacex,not_removed,is there confirmation of the presentation being streamed
spacex,not_removed,updated the attendee list ive heard no official word about a livestream beyond those reported emails rest assured this will be the place to find out about it if that does go forward
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,that would be awesome but i think it would be really hard to recreate that moment simple because the global political environment was different then
spacex,not_removed,you mean you are ready for your mct flight mars accommodations space travel insurance
spacex,not_removed,how about a rspacex polo to represent the sub httpimgurcomhwlqzez or does that not fit the iac dress code
spacex,not_removed,meeting anyone handsome andor talented in guadalajara i feel thats bullet point worthy
spacex,not_removed,thank you for linking this i hate to calculate different timezones
spacex,not_removed,click play on the and itll give you a countdown now
spacex,not_removed,what school if i may be bold enough to ask
spacex,not_removed,added
spacex,not_removed,where you coming from mate
spacex,not_removed,id like to see other peoples opinions on it first
spacex,not_removed,pens are very effective antirocket projectiles when shot from the correct firearm ive learned a lot about how to destroy beautiful things in my weeks in the us
spacex,not_removed,need to figure out my arrangements in la for the hours that im there theres an incredible piece of flown space hardware thats on public display pretty close to lax endeavour of course
spacex,not_removed,figure out what talks at iac i want to attend at this point im only aware of musks and bezos heres a panel discussion relevant to human travel to mars highlight lecture wednesday september – location guadalajara hall mars base camp is lockheed martins vision for sending humans to mars by – and bringing them home safely this presentation will analyze the architecture science objectives and mission profile all of which build on the deep space capabilities of nasas orion and sls programs might be interesting for comparison edit hope you have a great time there and learn a lot the fact that jeff bezos just revealed the new glenn may tempt elon to tell more about bfrmct than he otherwise would have
spacex,not_removed,if you plan on a la meet up i would be interested
spacex,not_removed,spacex tour must be someone on this thread who could pull some strings itar would be an issue tho
spacex,not_removed,tour spacex if you can get the hookup also im nearby so wouldnt mind grabbing a drink with you guys in la
spacex,not_removed,i am almost certain that elon musk and his mars team at spacex came to the conclusion that tons of cargo on mars per flight is the best way to rapidly set up the industry and infrastructure required to build a settlement using martian materials without being wasteful by sending too much stuff for people to actually useset up during every sardonic period and without being too anemic that progress could be happening faster but is limited by cargo sent from earth they would have come up with this number through countless hours of meetings figuring out logistics trying to build an understanding of starting a new industrial society from scratch and so forth until they settled on a number that was both doable and enabled it to be done quickly which happened to be tons once they had the goal in mind they would have done the math and figured that trying to make a launch vehicle capable of putting that mass on mars on its own would be ridiculously difficult a rocket many times the size of a saturn v after doing some more thinking and number crunching they would have found that if they downsized the rocket to a more reasonable still huge size they could get the same payload to mars as long as they used onorbit refueling now that they had a basic idea of an architecture they could work out that their rocket would need to lift something around tons into leo per launch with that in mind and the fuel choice of methalox due to isru considerations the rockets overall size would become more clear as for the engines we know that they already made some changes to the plan regarding engine size and number the raptor was originally going to be bigger than an but got downsized to about of that size most likely to give a more manageable twr during the descent and landing phase of both the first stage booster and the spacecraft on mars a landing twr would be far from optimal for a large spacecraft landing on a rough undeveloped mars from the payload requirements and engine specifications itd be easy to narrow down on the number of engines required per stage which would depend on the number of stages and so forth basically i dont think spacex would start by designing a rocket to nowhere then design a mission architecture around it since its their hardware and their flight plan they can optimize the launch vehicle however they want
spacex,not_removed,even my lame ass prediction was gilded someone was very generous
spacex,not_removed,will there be a crowd funded element to some of this i doubt it the biggest crowdfunding campaign i can find that doesnt give a preorder or something of value is for victims of the orlando nightclub shooting thats a drop in the ocean for a mars mission they would be more likely to get funding via sponsorship eg a tesla rover or a john deere backhoe
spacex,not_removed,contrary to common belief getting a foreigner on a tour isnt all that difficult they just need some extra id and advance warning
spacex,not_removed,awesome added
spacex,not_removed,whatever details they give us well always want more
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,i think the names will be derived from science fiction that elon likes it seems thats how everything has been named so far maybe something will be named heart of gold from hitchikers guide to the galaxy or vanguard from orphans in the sky nostromo or serenity would be neat
spacex,not_removed,spacex will start shopping around after iac for a site to build and launch the mars vehicles theyll hunt for tax breaks etc from the likes of texas georgia and florida i think theyll eventually go for texas due to proximity to their other sites engines avionics etc will be built in hawthorne tankage etc will be built at the launch site assuming your test launch date is correct i think spacex is already moving to build the bfr launch site albeit in superstealthy mode i think building a pad of that size plus necessary manufacturing and range infrastructure would have to be in progress at least the real estate portion of it would be if its based in the us my guess is that the launch site is in texas near the coast probably south of corpus christi i wouldnt necessarily rule out a noncontiguous usaffiliated launch site puerto rico guam etc but these arent likely i also wouldnt be surprised if spacex bought up a few driedup oil derricks in the gulf to convert to launch pads edit one thing im surprised about is how much trucking elon spacex seem ok with its a lot of driving around between hawthorne mcgregor and florida which in my mind is a big delay and launch risk flat tires crashes etc with elon having talked about the tesla manufacturing plant as a product id be surprised if this thinking isnt trickling over to spacexs testing processes
spacex,not_removed,took me this long to realise i posted my prediction in the wrong thread duh sorry folks ive posted it in the predictions thread now
spacex,not_removed,echo cant edit this post so its best to just summon me or the mods in general added
spacex,not_removed,i definitely agree that it would be useful to organize a bit of a breakfast in order to motivate us to wake up extra early to get a good spot in the potentially huge line waiting as a group would definitely make a line more enjoyable too
spacex,not_removed,added
spacex,not_removed,yup only days now cant wait i made a
spacex,not_removed,or lunar architecture they seem to go for that more although their goals are a little fuzzier than spacex in any case thats a discussion for the blue origin subreddit good luck
spacex,not_removed,may be you should let them reach the orbit first
spacex,not_removed,keep your eyes peeled for details dates evidence of progress crew progress could be interesting too maybe youll see a suit they are getting close anyways that seems to be the stuff they are ok with letting out personally id love engineering details but those are illegal to share p
spacex,not_removed,make sure you try the coffee and the froyo also if you get to go past the blue lines ill be super jealous have an amazing time
spacex,not_removed,added hope you enjoy guadalajara
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomnovaroad spacex just confirmed with me that elonmusks mars colony talk is still on the agenda for in guadalajara september this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,i believe it wouldve been delayed anyway because of wildfires
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,you fly for free dude be my friend ahaha
spacex,not_removed,nope not too late to register you have missed out on the early bird discount registration though any student is allowed to register for the conference regardless of degree or subject but you must be a full time student and upload a photo of your university student id
spacex,not_removed,thanks youre a king
spacex,not_removed,for anyone else curious martian meteorite that caused a sensation because it was suspected to hold microscopic bacterial fossils
spacex,not_removed,i cant help but see a giant pallet of cash about to be burned up in the atmosphere as the first stage separates and as it falls out of frame after interstage release and then why would you show video of your spaceship burning up in the atmosphere after mission completion i dont get the feeling that these people are the sharpest tools in the shed it is an amazingly small amount of massstation they are able to add with each sls and orion mission how many sls mission are they planning per year and arent those sls missions expensive in a nonreusable way and then take it to mars its a year old station by the time it gets ready to go
spacex,not_removed,do price is right rules apply put me down for kg to leo and meter tall
spacex,not_removed,cool great find here is what i found related to spacex small spacecraft for deepspace exploration this session focuses on innovative small spacecraft designs systems missions and technologies for the exploration of space beyond earth orbit target destinations for these miniaturized space probes include the earths moon mars small bodies and other deepspace destinations as well as near earth vicinity for necessary development and technology demonstration missions small exploration probes covered by this session may come in many different forms including specialpurpose miniature spacecraft standard format small platforms such as cubesats or other microsats nanosats picosats etc topics include new and emerging technologies in miniaturized subsystems including propulsion avionics guidance navigation control power supply communication thermal management and sensors and instruments main aspect on this session is on new and emerging systems and mission applications for deepspace exploration using small spacecraft cochairs leon alkalai national aeronautics and space administration nasajet propulsion laboratory — united states rene laufer baylor university — united states rapporteur amanda stiles spacex — united states
spacex,not_removed,also this seems to be an old document in the filename there is feb and the schedule on page has lbn on the last day the official website also had that version but got updated in the past month or so
spacex,not_removed,every thing ive heard says no
spacex,not_removed,it should be paging uechologic uzucal

spacex,not_removed,is the company just prepared to take a loss on this mission spacex would no doubt be willing to unilaterally fund mars colonisation out of their launchinternet revenue although this would probably happen over a longer timeframe than currently planned it seems a more likely scenario that spacex will gain some kind of sponsorship from government during the next presidential administration nasa cannot afford to miss the boat if spacex intend to land on mars almost a decade earlier likely some accommodation will be made for nasa to participate in return for a sizable contribution to the development costs and technical support
spacex,not_removed,i strongly suspect that once bfr is ready enough well see a spacex mars mission company pop into existence and a few ultra wealthy individuals will fund it protects spacex and provides means to pay for missions just a guess but id give it good odds note this is similar to movie productions where each one is a separate business entity
spacex,not_removed,is the company just prepared to take a loss on this mission i think they are at least initially developing bfr mct will be done with the money they earn from their daily operations flying and fh possibly supplemented by extra income from their leo internet constellation if that ever happens
spacex,not_removed,fixed it was pretty late when i converted that originally
spacex,not_removed,you cant leave us hanging what did your dream predict
spacex,not_removed,birthday twins
spacex,not_removed,depends on time zones
spacex,not_removed,done
spacex,not_removed,in that the front page is counting now up for the launch
spacex,not_removed,assist or attend
spacex,not_removed,its in the subreddits sidebar anytime you need it it also has yet to be stated if and or how the rud will effect the conference
spacex,not_removed,september
spacex,not_removed,thats a big unknown
spacex,not_removed,thats really cool that you do dubings of the broadcasts for people but i noticed while looking around your channel that it seems was mislabeled as
spacex,not_removed,and week discussion and the postannouncement discussion threads
spacex,not_removed,truly groundbreaking presentations are valued not just for their quality as presentations but also for their historical importance the rest of us will find out what was presented within a day or two at most but the people who attend will be able to say i was there when history was made elon has been talking for some time about how excited he is about giving this presentation about how hard its been not to leak the information before the presentation and about how many changes have been made from what was previously discussed based on what spacex has learned i think we can be confident that there will be some big surprises even if a presentation is short it can still provide a large amount of information for example httpsenwikipediaorgwikithemotherofalldemos introduced the computer mouse windows hypertext and many other features of modern computing ok it was minutes instead of but still it shows that its possible to get a lot into a short presentation and if it runs a few minutes extra i think the moderators may be reluctant to chase elon off the stage accepting that elons not going to tell us enough to let us build one of those ourselves there should be plenty of information to of quite a few of the speculations surrounding spacex mars colony plans
spacex,not_removed,i believe the mars direct presentations zubrin gave were only an hour long id expect a similar level of technical detail
spacex,not_removed,yeah but quality not quantity
spacex,not_removed,there was nothing since that info about tests of the oxygen rich preburner at stennis by nasa not spacex that was in april however they announced their timetable of launching mct to mars in which can only mean they are very well on track in their raptor development i hope we will get info during the presentation by elon musk
spacex,not_removed,is the air force still funding raptor as part of their project to get falcon a more capable upper stage if so maybe theres news on that front you could look into
spacex,not_removed,do you need tickets to get in
spacex,not_removed,dooo ittt im coming from uk and using my student card to cheaper entrance woot
spacex,not_removed,added youre our lucky
spacex,not_removed,just page mods
spacex,not_removed,added
spacex,not_removed,i remember someone saying the logical choice would be to go underground after a while whats almost certain is that people will tend to choose physics over tradition to design and build the colony my bet is that itll be the neatest place to live ever created by humans but only for a time you know before we go further out in the solar system
spacex,not_removed,i think the best compormise would be internconnected subterranean living spaces with dome structures at the surface work and sleep underground with the radiation protection but spend your leisure time above ground in the sunlight presumably multiple smaller domes will be safer and more practical
spacex,not_removed,they would not be stand alone they would be connected each pressure vessel with several others
spacex,not_removed,above ground pressure domes arent suitable in the near term unless were talking about very thick domes with some kind of waterlead lining the main issue is that while the radiation risk of traveling through space to mars and returning isnt too bad the risk for staying there long term decades is quite concerning and would be a major cause of mortality among colonists in the near term any colonies either need to be buried under dirt or need to be dug out underground
spacex,not_removed,nope dig a ditch lay down an inflatable with ribbed skeleton pour on a cement then back fill it with mars soil imagine something like a martian igloo
spacex,not_removed,yes treat it the same way as a video whose length keeps changing
spacex,not_removed,with css yes its not something we do routinely
spacex,not_removed,wwwspacexcommars says its hours from now
spacex,not_removed,get people to make predictions with a entry fee the winner gets an all expenses paid trip to the red planet or a house
spacex,not_removed,i dont think spacex would approve of us raffling off a tour nor would they approve of the employee thatd offer
spacex,not_removed,hopefully your plane will be delayed the service is terrible here in jakarta
spacex,not_removed,he has once said he will present it when he is reasonably sure that there wont be major design changes any more that sounds like it will be fairly detailed i personally believe it will include some info on the isru setup on mars as it is a necessary part of mct design
spacex,not_removed,its hard to tell the title refers to a deep technical discussion deep perhaps implying something tangible with regards to designs whilst discussion sort of implies something more vague however i feel that with the attention rspacex gets from people high up in the rankings someone would have clarified by now if we werent getting more details on designs its often the case that these people make these sorts of clarifications really cant tell though
spacex,not_removed,or by airship
spacex,not_removed,maybe future construction plans at mcgregor a lot closer but probably still to big to ship but you do have to note that spacex is making itself feel at home in texas
spacex,not_removed,its wellknown that it will be built where its launched
spacex,not_removed,we can only sticky two threads at a time unfortunately
spacex,not_removed,it is never a good idea to repurpose a propellant tank be it methane or lox temporarily those tanks will be needed for propellant on the flight back and wont be clean enough to be safely used again this has been discussed multiple times
spacex,not_removed,added
spacex,not_removed,surely theyll be on youtube within a day
spacex,not_removed,this for the spacex presentation
spacex,not_removed,can you provide a link then crosspost this comment to more relevant threads appreciate it
spacex,not_removed,does anybody really believe their architecture was designed like this and they dont have fiber to get the data off the pad within milliseconds
spacex,not_removed,you should delete this comment as kim has denied saying this and has requested that it be corrected
spacex,not_removed,in the past musk has detailed his intention to use a red dragon spacecraft to fly to mars in uncrewed mode in the time period later flights of the craft would transport humans to the planet humans to mars in a dragon i find that unlikely people wont be riding along until mct is operational unless its a one way trip i guess
spacex,not_removed,probably
spacex,not_removed,only one flair per post reddit sorely needs a tag system but youre right that the marsiac flair is probably more useful done
spacex,not_removed,one would hope there would be an official spacex stream to maximize coverage but i havent heard any information about livestreams
spacex,not_removed,most questions regarding presentations will likely have to wait until the deadline for presentation submissions which i believe is
spacex,not_removed,done
spacex,not_removed,there is but not linked here yet scroll around on rspacex
spacex,not_removed,pm tuesday if i did the math correct
spacex,not_removed,see these today there should be something at last
spacex,not_removed,where would you suggest we go then where in the solar system could possibly be better than mars
spacex,not_removed,why would you say that mars is a poor choice
spacex,not_removed,im sad this subreddit downvoted you for an opinion
spacex,not_removed,to the downvoters please dont downvote because you disagree with someones opinion
spacex,not_removed,well mars sucks but its the best of a bad bunch if your objective is human habitation most other options have worse radiation lower gravity lower temperatures or crushing heat and pressure only mars is truly feasible as a terraforming option it makes you appreciate what we have here on good old terra besides pretty sure i saw a clip of the its sitting on europa he seemed to think that would be a cool place to visit
spacex,not_removed,this isnt exactly the sort of event which can be delayed
spacex,not_removed,im thinking itll be a larger dragon essentially with a livable trunk that arrangement is feasible but you have to drop your trunk before mars entry and then have very limited living space on your way back from mars also whats with bfs being larger diameter then bfr this is largely to do with volume if you backwork the tonnes on mars payload figure you need around tonnes of propellant at tmi and again on mars takeoff so the propellant tanks take up around so allowing volume for the payload or up to colonists at around each gives a total internal capsule volume of if you have degree capsule walls similar to crew dragon then this volume implies a capsule base diameter of while the largest bfr diameter required by the number of engines is around note that this is a very similar ratio to a diameter fairing on top of a diameter so quite manageable from an aerodynamic point of view i do totally agree that the nose will be more rounded like a crew dragon rather than pointed as in the roc illustration if the bfs is the same diameter as the bfr then it will have to be cylindrical with the base and one side of the cylinder covered with tps tiles possible but heavier than a capsule shape with tps only on the base
spacex,not_removed,large diameter helps a lot for aerobraking your terminal velocity and rate of decelleration is mostly decided by the area that is braking and the weight of the craft which favors capsule shapes that have a flat fat end they can also be used with an offset center of mass to create controlled lift via rotation which can passively steer through some important parts of an atmospheric entry
spacex,not_removed,your username sircan you explain it to me
spacex,not_removed,i think elons recent tweat is the best confirmation we have that its going ahead
spacex,not_removed,he just confirmed today the talk is still on
spacex,not_removed,the most trustworthy word weve heard so far says it will still go on although its looking like the scope of the talk may have been decreased and may end up being more just a talk about colonizing mars than about the specifics of their new launcher design plus its days away so wed probably have heard by now if it was canceled
spacex,not_removed,if that user was reliable and was going to be covering the event indepth through written updates periscope streams and more it would be allowed this is in no way a plot to fund echo tvds tropical vacation funtime you should expect and deserve something in return
spacex,not_removed,we have crowdfunded other people before so yes we will be very clear about exactly what the money is going to pay for in a transparent fashion so there shouldnt be any concerns of embezzlement
spacex,not_removed,why isnt it appropriate it is kind of related to the topic of the sub modding is a tedious time consuming job and there should be some perks you have inspired me to donate to the cause my good sir thank you
spacex,not_removed,we have done one crowdfunding campaign in the past for a user who wasnt a moderator
spacex,not_removed,its hard to condemn since its voluntary but its not the classiest move ive seen
spacex,not_removed,this conference will be the first time im presenting this work to the science community so im quite nervous full disclosure this work was an unfunded theoretical research project as part of my postgraduate study i used the plant biology knowledge from my undergrad biology degree to come up with a recipe for an atmospheric composition using mostly martian air which would still allow plants to grow based on trawling through literature on plant biology i hope one day to get funding for experimental work to test if plants can grow in the atmosphere i designed
spacex,not_removed,the earth gets about at sea level with the sun directly overhead mars gets there are places on earth that because of the atmosphere get about the same or even less energy from the sun than some places on mars but thats above ° latitude a greenhouse on the equator of mars might actually get more sun though since it would have full hour days theyd just have to make sure it was very well insulated for the nights
spacex,not_removed,the inspiration for my research project came from this nasa technical report theres a group working on closed ecological systems in the states check out morgan irons and deep space ecology if youre interested in growing plants in martian regolith there is a group at university of wageningen in the netherlands they dont seem to have a website of their own but they do have a crowdfunding page httpscrowdfundingwageningenurnlprojectplantenkwekenopmarslocaleen i hope that is useful to you
spacex,not_removed,have a look at esas melissa program theyve published some of their work in scientific journals you can find a bunch of papers with a quick google eg
spacex,not_removed,amen to that the rspacex mods are the best mods on reddit hands down they have made this place absolutely spectacular for discussion and learning
spacex,not_removed,congratulations great start
spacex,not_removed,yeah lets say it again hug time ill never forget that rspacex is the reason i joined reddit and even discovered reddit from the begining and at the time there were only members
spacex,not_removed,modmail us with your email for an invite into the public slack that ss is from the moderator slack though
spacex,not_removed,also how are engines heatshield arranged on the mct eg like crew dragon under openable heatshield on side of mct like the french mars society proposal etc
spacex,not_removed,this wouldnt be too different from our subwide polls weve done in past so this seems decently doable i think itd be more fun to do it in a thread though since people can come up with new ideas with just a poll everyone is limited to what we come up with ill let the other mods chime in though
spacex,not_removed,dude that would be sweet whats the cutoff time for these tickets as i need sometime to clear it with my wife
spacex,not_removed,yeah with your local knowledge perhaps you could recommend a place arrange something
spacex,not_removed,musk tweeted the iac like days ago so thats pretty unlikely
spacex,not_removed,yeah that led me to first write that the email introduced the actual title but the brief summary included doesnt nearly approach what we have previously been led to expect the whole potential architecturesthat industry government and the scientific community can collaborate on is extremely far from a bfrmct reveal and overview my best guess is that iaf is simply trying to emphasize the collaborative aspects implicit within the colonization of mars as is pretty much inevitable and not bad from anything claiming to be an international federation edit furthermore rather than being an overview of the challenges that need to be solved it has generally been implied that the keynote would involve to some extent a deep look at spacexs solutions to some of the most pressing problems all in all a very confusing email
spacex,not_removed,did they juggle the date so as not to compete with the september us presidential debate i think that may have created some last minute changes
spacex,not_removed,day is the and the colonizing mars talk about mct is scheduled for the so these would both be on the same day unless the original talk was renamed to making humans a multiplanetary species which would mean not much info about mct after all
spacex,not_removed,i just hope they will give soo many details also an entire wikilike page on spacexcom renders datasheets simulations that there wont be much to speculate about
spacex,not_removed,im planning to go next year
spacex,not_removed,blue could give more details about their orbital plans and promote the
spacex,not_removed,inside elons head
spacex,not_removed,something like mct master or isru master depending on which part theyve guessed right would be cool
spacex,not_removed,i have a faxmachine as well
spacex,not_removed,mods reckon its just gonna be a go nowhere thread full of name speculation and the like elon is just not being serious and scientific enough for this sub we need to tell him to lift his twitter game
spacex,not_removed,it looks like there have only been posts approved in the last hours
spacex,not_removed,my heart skipped a beat as i clicked that link elon really got me
spacex,not_removed,me too i stared for a while thinking days in the title but submitted month ago how can this how its a fun trick i like it
spacex,not_removed,were updating it daily or at least trying to
spacex,not_removed,well yes but im hoping they wont
spacex,not_removed,what makes you think we wont get an actual name for it
spacex,not_removed,words best i can do
spacex,not_removed,well its still not clear which of these topics will be discussed
spacex,not_removed,yeah i dont think its necessarily an issue he cant talk meaningfully about bfr and mct without addressing refueling on mars and the underlying reasons for going and he cant talk meaningfully about colonising mars without addressing how to to get there i suspect its the same essential content
spacex,not_removed,i kind of agree basically he has to cover the reasoning for going survival of species the means of going bfgmct and the means of surviving and thriving isru colonisation tech for the whole thing to make any sense to the pressjoe average
spacex,not_removed,this will be really good i hope someone can stream it live
spacex,not_removed,also did you receive the mail forwarded to rspacexcom
spacex,not_removed,you know i hear the soviets are already a third of the way through their bag of pinec grabs bag homf nomf homf grrofmph
spacex,not_removed,rosehulman institute of technology its a small but well respected engineering school in indiana spacex seems to like our students as ive talked to a few classmates that have gotten internships there and this is the second time theyve come to our career fair i personally dont meet their gpa requirements
spacex,not_removed,my reasoning if you make a new comment a couple of days later it is lost at the bottom of the thread with no one seeing it
spacex,not_removed,i support the suggestion
spacex,not_removed,prefer new
spacex,not_removed,i support this
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,that is optimal imho
spacex,not_removed,that is just wrong
spacex,not_removed,pens are very effective antirocket projectiles when shot from the correct firearm airport screening tip when you get asked about the pens please dont mention that possibility to the tsa officer
spacex,not_removed,in this crazy world please dont put the words destroy and weeks in the us there are crazy dudes in the tsa just making nice people having bad times my advice edit that post have a safe trip
spacex,not_removed,your edit brings up a very good point amos may have dampened the desire to discuss grand plans or the publics desire to hear grand plans but i think it is clear that blue origins announcement is helping elons cause by directing the publics mind toward bigger and better things onward and upward
spacex,not_removed,there is a million different ways they could have done it designing around the marsearth vehicle mars orbit rendezvous leo assembly instead of refueling if this architecture is successful the design method has large implications for the way nasa and congress do things
spacex,not_removed,same here i put down two lines and then ill keep updating this then of course totally forgot about it
spacex,not_removed,getting one a job however is a little bit more challenging
spacex,not_removed,minutes feels like such a small amount of time when we are talking about mars plans its going to go by so fast
spacex,not_removed,also c stands for congress not conference but i dont want to take away from your motivation i love the thread and your preparations for the next days nonetheless great work
spacex,not_removed,its one of the few things we cant use first principles to predict so far theyve been very hot on birdofprey names falcon kestrel merlin raptor draco but then they also used dragon so it could be something else flightrelated something mythical cant wait to find out
spacex,not_removed,yes please call it a firefly or serenity elon nostromo or sulaco would be pretty cool too though
spacex,not_removed,some good points thanks i disagree that oil rigs are a potential launch pad i think theyll want to keep things as easy as possible i think bos integrated factory testing ground and launch pad at ccafs is a more likely direction though in spacexs case im sure theyll do most of the manufacturing at hawthorne still i think theyll just do the big stuff that cant be easily transported at the launch facility
spacex,not_removed,ill be in line well before breakfast
spacex,not_removed,im down for breakfast is there a group or something for us lot that are going
spacex,not_removed,you know what spacex didnt reach orbit before they reached orbit
spacex,not_removed,unnecessarily savage i suspect you might be eating those words in a few years
spacex,not_removed,personally id love engineering details but those are illegal to share p just want to add to this caution first its fun to share juicy details but we dont like spacex legal contacting us if we need to take something proprietary down and neither will you or the employee who showed you around
spacex,not_removed,just go work for an airline crappy pay crappy hours awesome flight benifits
spacex,not_removed,again relying on the mods for the data logging unless its open access but no if youre over by or under by itll be the same percentage difference itll be calculated relative to the actual
spacex,not_removed,yep i saw that too should be fascinating and it does seem a bit dated do you have a link for the newer version you found i cannot seem to find it for the life of me
spacex,not_removed,do you have a link
spacex,not_removed,its on the way dont fret
spacex,not_removed,so the going to mars thing is a way to motivate support in congress that makes sense to me thank you
spacex,not_removed,nasa cannot afford to miss the boat if spacex intend to land on mars almost a decade earlier hmm i sort of agree but if nasa dont provide a lot of funding spacex probably cant do it or cant do it any faster than nasa so its really up to nasacongress whether it happens ten years earlier or not
spacex,not_removed,advertising and exclusivitiesproduct placement have the potential to contribute a significant percent to the overall costs
spacex,not_removed,developing bfr mct will be done with the money they earn from their daily operations flying and fh problem is this is kind of at odds with their other stated aim to lower the cost barrier to access to space they are the lowest cost option on the market and reusability has been sold as a way to lower that cost further their margins must already be pretty low if they fly missions per year and theyre only making say profit per mission can they really finance a project as huge as bfrits on only per year i actually dont think mission profits are going to make up even the bulk of the mars funding sources
spacex,not_removed,well it was as vague as most dreams are but there was a big ass rocket with a futuristic spaceship on top i remember being slightly disappointed by the diameter of the rocket but other than that i forget the details oh it was all chrome colored because of course everything is chrome in the future
spacex,not_removed,if its in guadalajara its only an hour off for me
spacex,not_removed,officially attend but i found this bit on the subject interesting even though its talking about french and spanish not mexican english it probably carries over well a sort of euroenglish influenced by foreign languages is already in use many europeans use control to mean monitor because contrôler has that meaning in french the same goes for assist meaning to attend assister in french asistir in spanish read in the
spacex,not_removed,attend
spacex,not_removed,i didnt say i couldnt find the information just that it would be convenient to have it in the heading of the thread
spacex,not_removed,the question would be a lot less interesting if there was a known answer
spacex,not_removed,oh right fixed
spacex,not_removed,great way to paint the presentation i will be attending in september and you just got me doubly hyped
spacex,not_removed,this is why i wish i could make the numbers work with what im being paid by september £ to fly from the uk
spacex,not_removed,was looking for something comparable thanks will have to check that talk out
spacex,not_removed,i think thats precisely the point the quality of the talk suffers if its too short
spacex,not_removed,i completely agree about the absolute dearth of information about the bfrmct i even see a whole lot of raw speculation based upon the most tenuous of evidence that is taken as absolute fact it will be fantastic to actually get some real information rather than all of the speculation and fan models that have been made so far i dont mind the hype but at least ground it upon some sort of reality one of the things ive seen happen to the raptor design at least based upon public statements for its performance values is a nearly constant downgrading of its capabilities so much so that i have speculated that instead of merely talking about the singular raptor engine it very likely is a family of engines that spacex is developing that has multiple performance targets that the engineers have been talking about i certainly wouldnt be surprised to see at least a falcon test article aka the core itself built using a engine that would be called a raptor engine for either a test flight or even a revenue flight launching from
spacex,not_removed,people on air force projects dont tweet hints about what they are doing
spacex,not_removed,you have to register to be able to enter the conference building registration costs are for students or for young professionals dollars me personally i need tickets when i decide for sure i want to go which depends a bit on some factors like finance and company on the way there
spacex,not_removed,ace thanks
spacex,not_removed,nooooooooooo i mixed up the pt and utc times now i have to watch am
spacex,not_removed,ill take the house on the red planet
spacex,not_removed,awwwww then i guess raffling off a trip to mars is completely out of the question
spacex,not_removed,this is common with major international conferences elon knows what he is going to say and what days he is speaking but the people organizing the conference have to wait for all the confirmations to publish the name and title of all the talks there is a person or group of people in charge and even they dont know the schedule until all the speakers confirm however we should be able to confirm or talks fairly quickly edit also i think the dates got changed because of the presidential debate on the that is why they bumped up the date of the conference
spacex,not_removed,hard to tell indeed how deep can you go if you only have an hour
spacex,not_removed,if they make the tanks light enough they could be the airship
spacex,not_removed,and its wellknown that it will be launched from bocachica
spacex,not_removed,ok can you give it an artificially high upvote count so it floats to the top without being stickied
spacex,not_removed,im having trouble believing it and wondering why nasa would have a feed from inside ccafs on a commercial nonnasa launch odd thing to say and i cant find his source edit debunked
spacex,not_removed,a lot of media reports seem to confuse the falcon heavy with the bfr presumably because its spacexs upcoming rocket and they cant imagine their being more than one
spacex,not_removed,if i could bring my surface pro my external hard drive of tv and movies and my nook with a few dozen good books id be so down to take a solo trip to mars paging spacex
spacex,not_removed,whelp i missed that sentence very good point to which i agree
spacex,not_removed,wasnt there when i posted this
spacex,not_removed,sweet thanks man
spacex,not_removed,i think that some of jupiters or saturnes moons are a more exciting goal there is more chance that we find life there and they are a bit more hospitable albeit colder and further away its just my opinion though and its subject to change i love to hear others opinion
spacex,not_removed,my two cents is that mars is an hostile environnement and just because its one of the closest planets and was maybe habitable a long time ago doesnt mean it is still the right choice today i understand that the martian dust is highly corrosive and toxic and there are regular sandstorms maybe geoengineering could make it hospitable but it is a long way to go and in my opinion a waste of money when we know of some other places that are more likely to have life a bit more hospitable im referring to jupiters or saturnes moons for exemple then again my initial message was a bit off its just a personnal opinion and i dont even firmly believe in it theres always room for debate
spacex,not_removed,it just happens you know i dont really mind i think what they didnt understand was that i was supporting musk either way
spacex,not_removed,lol i didnt see that its at a convention
spacex,not_removed,that arrangement is feasible but you have to drop your trunk before mars entry not at all see urulerofslides reference to triconic mars entry vehicles
spacex,not_removed,cylindrical with the base and one side of the cylinder covered with tps tiles tweak that a bit and you can have a lifting body shape which im thinking may be necessary for a prolonged aerobraking path and precision targeting of landing site you can still land vertically under retropulsion
spacex,not_removed,i know the msl used the slight tilt to fly a bit in the atmosphere while arriving at mars it flew albiet like a brick but it flew
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomelonmusk turns out mct can go well beyond mars so will need a new name this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,the problem is there is no way to keep it clean when money is involved mods are crossing the line there is an easy way to remove the conflict of interest boot them from being mods
spacex,not_removed,replying to the mod instead of the chain below but he does have a bit of a point that there is room for a perception of conflict of interest edit his initial point has some merit the following chain is a bit more paranoid rconspiracy for my taste its worth pointing out from my understanding that the crowd funding is going towards specific portions of their cost but not their entire trip costs and i would assume capped at that actual cost spelling that out would help id also suggest since it seems like many other users are going a portion of the crowd funding might go towards a fund that is open for all of them to share its too complicated to have something like itemized expenses but it could fund something like a meet up with dinner etc depending on how much is given or even a contribution towards their entrance costs since if they enter theyve paid that cost just thinking there may be some ways that the benefit of a crowd funding campaign can be spread more broadly and encourage everyone attending to contribute content to the sub
spacex,not_removed,well i have my opinion and the conflict of interestdoor for abuse is real so take it for what it is you are a mod so naturally you side with mods groupthink will take care of most users as anyone who usually disagrees with mods gets the banhammer which i kinda fully expect to happen just for me trying to discuss this issue sadly you guys will ghosts the posts so no one else can see them either i know how it works this is why groupthink is so strong here
spacex,not_removed,theres also a lot of shadow on earth clouds trees buildings etc that temporarily or sometimes even permanently reduce the solar irradiation that reaches the plants also you could of course focusincrease irradiation in a greenhouse using solar panels and leds
spacex,not_removed,it mostly needs to avoid radiating in the infrared frequencies glass will do that even a very thin glass coating on another material the atmosphere is so thin that it will not convect much heat avoiding overheating during the day may be the larger concern to be on topic i believe that greenhouses will be part of elons presentation at least if he presents his full plan instead of concentrating on transport
spacex,not_removed,surface solar radiation on a clear day is about the average is lower when you account for weather in terms of solar flux a sunny day on mars is about the same as a slightly overcast day on earth i dont think the difference in average solar flux between earth and mars is quite as sever as you think
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,absolutely the best mod team on reddit
spacex,not_removed,what is this spacex slack
spacex,not_removed,thats what im most curious about i feel the side version is pretty ugly and spacex would try to avoid that so im curious what theyre planning i was thinking perhaps something dragonlike except the thrusters themselves can pop out from the sides to face straight down
spacex,not_removed,yeah the thread cant be left out especially to read rockets long and detailed prediction if he ever writes one though you can add text inputs to the form they could give bonus points for example but evaluating those can be trickier than moderating the sub also the thread is fun if viewable by anyone and the google forms is fair if we hide results until the event then the spreadsheet results statistics can and should be shared of course two different species in my opinion
spacex,not_removed,chime no chime i can do the best survey you ever seen in your life you dont even have to do anything actually there is still a month left i dont want to promise stuff will just do it
spacex,not_removed,looks like the registration is over and its now
spacex,not_removed,id love to help out where i can i just need to know what sort of parameters are on the problem eg near the convention center or vegetarian or what not
spacex,not_removed,this is going to sound weird but do i know you im in fourth year mathsphysics at vic
spacex,not_removed,awsome thanks
spacex,not_removed,rspacex meetup recap video is a must
spacex,not_removed,cool i also just saw a minute after i posted this the post about live streaming the events including musk so definitely seems to be on hoping for at least a quick nod to the fire
spacex,not_removed,elon was pretty clear back in june at the code conference that he was going to be unveiling plans for a very big rocket apologies if theres a better way to cite this em the basic game plan is were going to send a mission to mars for every mars opportunity from onwards they occur approximately every months were establishing cargo flights to mars that people can depend on for cargo and its like i said the earthmars orbital rendezvous is only every months so theres one in therell be another one in and i think if things go according to plan we should be able to we should be able to launch people probably in with arrival in em there are certainly some uncertainties associated with that so anyway thats the game plan approximately to launch the first of the mars colonial transport system with people this will be a very big rocket wm very big bigger than a saturn v em very big yes wm twice as big or what em september ill tell you wm not going to say anything until september come on em very big wm come on em it has to be very big wm how big is very big em em so big
spacex,not_removed,additionally it concerns me if this is a replacement that its listed as a keynote rather than a technical presentation i was previously told access to elon musks presentation was unrestricted but a keynote is more likely to have pesky things such as seating plans and access restrictions in my mind
spacex,not_removed,oh dear we may be disappointed i like i think most here have been waiting for this speech with a lot of anticipation hoping for solid details a timeline and the statement we will do it but the précis in the email sounds like it will be a discussion on what is possible rather than what is planned although that doesnt fit with the journalist i think chris b who said hed seen plans and they were very exciting edit found the
spacex,not_removed,im not exactly sure there will be mars colonization architecture unveilings every year but i wouldnt mind so
spacex,not_removed,live in adelaide so ill be there too
spacex,not_removed,nice armchair master engineer chief armchair mct designer
spacex,not_removed,me too he knows how to tease 😆
spacex,not_removed,much better
spacex,not_removed,id still rather they go with big falcon rocket so we can keep the bfr initialism instead of changing it to something else altogether though
spacex,not_removed,im hoping for enterprise
spacex,not_removed,elon musk already said that the reason for the bfr is in reference to the from the game doom considering that the game is set on mars well actually phobos but mars is in the sky and the tendency for whimsical names that have deep meaning i really doubt the name is going to change
spacex,not_removed,to whoever replied to darron the distinction between potential architectures and potential transport architectures is probably not apparent they probably feel they gave a completely adequate reply there should be enough reddit folk at the meeting to badger elon into spilling the beans perhaps more information could be gathered while taking the group photo with him
spacex,not_removed,probably the best person to ask to clear up the confusion would be elon im sure hed do that
spacex,not_removed,we did thanks
spacex,not_removed,semi formal uh oh i was ginning to wear my occupy mars tshirt what will you be at lax if your layover is long enough you can go see out in front of spacex there is a bus basically from lax to the area its a short hop
spacex,not_removed,iac is very formal but only for presenters important people
spacex,not_removed,thanks the recruiters do get around a lot hope things work out for you gpa can be beat
spacex,not_removed,why dyou think im getting echo to bring them
spacex,not_removed,while i appreciate the sentiment i would like to be free to make jokes about my username well jokes about anything really if it means i have to get randomly searched in an airport so be it thanks though
spacex,not_removed,ill bite whats involved i do itarrelated work in the uk so ive always been curious o
spacex,not_removed,hopefully this doesnt just become a teaser for a second announcement with the real details
spacex,not_removed,falcon was named after the millennium falcon right the rest are engines not ships the two other ships are named after space ships from books and the dragon refers to the song puff the magic dragon because everyone said he must be high to want to build rockets please correct me if i am wrong about any of this as i am just recalling from what i remember reading over the years
spacex,not_removed,the ostrich because its a huge bird
spacex,not_removed,probably a good decision waking up early generally destroys me but ill probably try to get in line as early as possible i wish i had some past knowledge to help judge how crazy or not crazy it is going to be
spacex,not_removed,i believe we will have our own private thread sometime in the near future we could also certainly make a facebook messenger group private slack or something along those lines to aid communication
spacex,not_removed,i see this doc for the first time only seen a new version of the schedule on iac and iaf sites so dont know if the pdf has a newer version or not maybe not as it has final in its name also seems like it has the technical part but not the plenary where lbn with elon would be detailed on the iaf site you can see these two as separate tabs
spacex,not_removed,you mean this
spacex,not_removed,take your time just wanted to make sure you didnt forget it im going to bed now and maybe i will wake up seeing a pleasant surprise
spacex,not_removed,nasa will have to jump on the wagon sls will be seen as massive wastage and there will be taxpayer outcry when crazy massive multi core rockets start doing the launchlandrepeat number
spacex,not_removed,did you by any chance see what the berfr bfr will be like
spacex,not_removed,yea but seriously if something was known it would be on the hot page in a matter of seconds
spacex,not_removed,hope you have a fantastic time there and also hope you post your impressions so those of us at home can experience some of the magic
spacex,not_removed,yes but i am assuming that this will still be very high quality while being a bit short
spacex,not_removed,one of the things ive seen happen to the raptor design at least based upon public statements for its performance values is a nearly constant downgrading of its capabilities during his january elon commented that the goal has been to select an engine size that optimizes the thrust to weight ratio and said looks like a little over metric tons klbf of thrust per engine appeared to be the best do you have more recent information lower value of thrust i certainly wouldnt be surprised to see at least a falcon test article aka the core itself built using a engine that would be called a raptor engine for either a test flight or even a revenue flight launching from urocket and others have also pointed out the benefits of using methane for earth launch it will be interesting to see whether spacex decides to adapt the falcon first stage to methane an important context for the development of the raptor is the effective competition with blue origins which has chosen a similar thrust of lbf it will be interesting to see what the two companies come up with
spacex,not_removed,one of the things ive seen happen to the raptor design at least based upon public statements for its performance values is a nearly constant downgrading of its capabilities you emphasize downgrading there as if it were a bad thing and without proper context the evidence and comments that we have point to using more smaller engines rather than fewer large engines because the smaller engines perform better
spacex,not_removed,one of the things ive seen happen to the raptor design at least based upon public statements for its performance values is a nearly constant downgrading of its capabilities so much so that i have speculated that instead of merely talking about the singular raptor engine it very likely is a family of engines that spacex is developing that has multiple performance targets that the engineers have been talking about my theory is that the downsizing is mostly about being able to most of the raptor massively reducing rd latency allowing a lighter engine and dropping manufacturing costs i think that like with the merlin there will only be two raptor variants raptorvac with a longer nozzle and raptor sl a full size raptorvac might be prototyped for the falcon heavy upper stage a single raptorvac could fit into the existing fh upper stage diameter envelope
spacex,not_removed,another aussie ill be up as well
spacex,not_removed,fill them with helium and it floats sounds to good to be true
spacex,not_removed,it would make sense and its been commonly assumed but ive seen no tangible evidence outside speculative assumption
spacex,not_removed,haha no noone can control the number of votes that a post receives doing so would kinda violate the core concept behind reddit its currently on rspacexs front page all by itself though
spacex,not_removed,i dont think any surface in the solar system other than earths is more hospitable than the surface of mars
spacex,not_removed,most of jupiters moons orbit through jupiters unbelievably violent radiation belts and would be very dangerous for human habitation saturns moons are nicer but they are very far away that means it takes much longer to get there making the supply requirements for the journey out prohibitive mars really is the best option at this point in humanitys development
spacex,not_removed,httpwwwnasagovfeaturegoddardthefactandfictionofmartianduststorms arent really that bad colonizing anything near jupiter is going to give you httpsenwikipediaorgwikiexplorationofjupiterhumanexploration
spacex,not_removed,ah yea the corrosive dust is just as bad as the moons sandstorms are quite mild and more like a fog on earth in terms of hospitabilty its actually the only planet other than earth in the solar system with the minerals and water for another technological civilization
spacex,not_removed,that triconic design is essentially a cylinder with a blunt nose and tps on one side a trunk is an unpressurised attachment to a capsule that typically contains propulsion and long endurance power and life support functions
spacex,not_removed,the falcon first stage flies with up to a degree aoa while returning through the atmosphere but the control and the times that you can do it safely are a lot more limited than a capsuleshaped design afaik
spacex,not_removed,nobody is forcing you to donate we will be very clear and upfront with where the money will go
spacex,not_removed,mods in this subreddit have already twice handled financial events for fundraisers in general i dont actually see the concern theres a far greater risk that random users will run off with money raised than moderators any billybob could put together a convincing enough argument that they should receive money to attend an event they raise some money and theyre never seen again poof goes your funds with moderators there is nearly always a far greater paper trail involved its not hard to find out who is who on most subreddits and moderators usually have a mutual interest in wanting to continue to participate in their community which makes scurrying off with raised funds much more difficult
spacex,not_removed,that isnt exactly viable it shouldnt be surprising that the people most enthused about spacex events are both mods here and willing to travel to a different country to help cover an event
spacex,not_removed,i agree the actual fundraiser will of course be very clear as to what is being funded we wouldnt want to leave any room for doubt since it would hurt our future fundraising initiatives
spacex,not_removed,it appears you were not around at the time but about six months ago there was general agreement that we would fund remote cameras to watch asds unloading attendance at conferences and other newsworthy items that would otherwise be missed out on i dont personally appreciate the mods against the plebs tone of your post but you have said nothing to get banned for reasonable questions but the sub has a different point of view upvoting you for courage rather than your views
spacex,not_removed,it is just another spot to chat about spacex stuff in a different format
spacex,not_removed,yeah the keep everything as simple and proven as possible part of me thinks itll be most like crew dragon but i dont know if the figures for aerocapturing etc would work
spacex,not_removed,pretty much what echo said in slack p
spacex,not_removed,pm the people going to the iac dont forget to also ask for other people not going to the iac in the area
spacex,not_removed,i can imagine him having two different presentations one the spacex mars launch system covers the indepth nuts and bolts current progress and near term developments on the necessary proposed launch system bfrmct it will have details on how they will make this audacious reuse an enormous rocket plan work in practice and also serve as a sales pitch for the platform then there is another subject the colonisation of mars which is a slightly more speculative and much more diverse subject and might well have contributions from other parties like nasa who have done relevant research spacex will be depending on like shotwell said regarding radiation protection etc i hope we either get both options or just option but not just option
spacex,not_removed,i definitely agree the code interview very strongly suggested that their mars architecture had more or less completed what nasa might call its preliminary design review and is in the process of progressing to initial trial manufacturing and quality control verification or already is into that phase i firmly suspect that we will indeed be granted a technical and deep overview of their firm mars architecture nevertheless it goes against my better judgement to fall prey to hype and escalate expectations accordingly and i subsequently am doing my best to keep my expectations heavily grounded almost pessimistically so given spacexs and musks publically admitted habits of setting extremely optimistic goals as a source of motivation it is definitely the best present route to take full transparency i am spending of my own money to visit in person so i am admittedly biased in my desire to keep expectations low and thus better ensure that even a keynote with few concrete details will still be rewarding d
spacex,not_removed,my interpretation is that it is the same thing they just renamed it
spacex,not_removed,yeah that is definitely a bit worrisome i am extremely excited for some of the other plenary and technical presentations but it would still be exceedingly disappointing if spacexs presentations became more restricted
spacex,not_removed,i would be surprised if there was nothing that year
spacex,not_removed,melbourne
spacex,not_removed,they removed my post i whined to the mods a bit but they stuck to their guns one day ill get a post past the mods this was not that day
spacex,not_removed,i was in the middle of a party and i pretty much ran out of the room to watch that video
spacex,not_removed,also bfx is a common formula for naming big stuff at least among us geeks
spacex,not_removed,i sent him a tweet no reply yet
spacex,not_removed,he could go on a tour at spacex wink
spacex,not_removed,the recruiters were at rit a couple weeks ago first college of the season plus they have a cool new system that allows you to put in your major other basic info and theyll send you a list of potential internships
spacex,not_removed,i think that way too you will have no problem for sure about the trip do you guys plan to live stream it maybe you can preorder a mifi and live stream if its allowed and there will be no official live stream
spacex,not_removed,im in exactly the same position as you presumably it puts you in better stead than people who arent trusted to do itar based work mine is associated with nasa tech but its still pretty hard to get anyone to sponsor you in unless youre really really good at your job
spacex,not_removed,judging by his interviews elon is as excited for the conference as we are
spacex,not_removed,yep youre right however everythings connected to flight too thats surely not coincidence and although it perhaps started with falcon theyve obviously taken that in the direction of birds of prey since
spacex,not_removed,which cant actually fly yeeee thats not gonna be it d
spacex,not_removed,oh okay i see what you meant and it is likely that the schedule wont be finalized particularly the plenary section until a week or so before the conference presentation summaries arent due until september or so
spacex,not_removed,forget haha these poor guys
spacex,not_removed,good write up man so what are the benefits of methane on earth out of curiosity i know that the chilled temps are close to lox so you could use a common bulkhead saving weight but thats literally all i know
spacex,not_removed,using more smaller engines rather than fewer large engines because the smaller engines perform better ill wait and see just what is coming from spacex with the big announcement before making any other wild guesses there was the recent report of a raptor engine at mcgregor that apparently was a reduced size engine even smaller than the smallest estimate for the size of a raptor even though it is acknowledged as mostly a test article for development in general as for throwing more engines on a rocket there is a practical limit of how far that can go the rocket that the soviet union built had engines and blew up on the pad every time it was tried with one of those launch attempts noted as among the top five nonnuclear explosions ever to be recorded in human history the falcon heavy which still hasnt flown yet you should start asking some serious questions as to why that might be too has engines lets just say i would be dumbfounded and shocked if spacex had a rocket with a stage containing more than engines that needed to be fired at the same time simply based upon the history of rocketry there are definitely some very dangerous dragons that need to be slain in that terra incognita of rocket research before you can even presume some sort of safety there a limit of engines also puts an extreme lower limit on what the thrust of a raptor can possibly be if you are going to launch the tonnage that seems to be bantered around on this subreddit
spacex,not_removed,and are easier to manufacture
spacex,not_removed,a full size raptorvac might be prototyped for the falcon heavy upper stage a single raptorvac could fit into the existing fh upper stage diameter envelope where the mvac bell is already at the max diameter of the interstage i have trouble imagining an engine roughly the thrust to a good fit for the upper stage not saying they wont do it but there would be efficiency sacrifices in not having the big bell given that the interstage is composite and bolted to the tankage perhaps it could be expanded somewhat to accommodate a larger nozzle but length would have to increase also and thats already a problem not to mention aero stability concerns
spacex,not_removed,you going next year btw i could be japanese
spacex,not_removed,if the main tanks are diameter x tall optimistic their volume would be about thats about times the volume of a falcon first stage which rulerofslides if you can lift kg per with helium thats tons even with composites id estimate bfr tank mass off the cuff at about times the weight of the tanks or about tons scale mass linearly with tank volume as suggested in one of rulerofslides discussions then give a discount for stronger materials
spacex,not_removed,i was sure that mods had control of anonymous bots that could be set to upvote a dummy thread every second or so without tripping reddit safeguards grin
spacex,not_removed,when i was talking about dust storms it was more about the fact that they would carry toxic dust around than the winds power radiations in the jovian system look bad indeed i didnt know it was such a prevalent issue however if we want to set ourselves for deep space exploration well have to find a way to deal to shield our astronauts from radiations whether they are in their space suit or in their lab anyway exploring space in any way is still exciting ill take mars no problem if it is unanimously considered the best choice for manned exploration of the solar system
spacex,not_removed,so the guy forgot the word triconic and still tried to get his point across give em a break
spacex,not_removed,of course but soliciting money from users as a mod is a pretty big no no
spacex,not_removed,the issue is that mods are exploiting the fact they are mods to solicit money from the community this is never good and should be a violating of site rules even now you are probably contemplating banning me from the subreddit for even asking the question proving my point
spacex,not_removed,as long an any unforeseen overrun goes to the bar tab of the meetup with the most people from the subreddit this im game to toss a few bucks im sure you guys will be cool about using the money
spacex,not_removed,it is a big difference when mods are the ones being chosen to do this and not someone who isnt in control of everything posted on the subreddit right now there are posts in this very thread being hidden when you have the ability to control everything that is posted it becomes inappropriate to choose yourself to be the nominee to take trips with community funded money where was the open selection process
spacex,not_removed,like im sorry
spacex,not_removed,i perhaps naively was hoping that this presentation would unveil a plan to colonise mars that spacex could carryout largely on its own using funding from the sale of seats and spacexs own assets i thought it highly likely that nasa maybe asked to help fund some of the initial developments and initial flights but i was hoping that broadly it would pay for itself the language seems to have been toned down a lot though from a deep technical presentation on the space transport architecture needed to colonize mars which to me implied that they are unveiling the systems necessary to at least get to mars the updated description musk will discuss the longterm technical challenges that need to be solved sounds like more of a discussion of the issues than the solutions and the technical presentation will focus on potential architectures for colonizing the red planet that industry government and the scientific community can collaborate on in the years ahead this definitely implies that spacex intends to only be part of the solution and will require substantial collaboration from the national and international community what do you guys make of it
spacex,not_removed,hoping that this is the rest of the picturei can get us here but now this is what we need to stay type of presentation to dovetail with the bfrmct announcement ¢
spacex,not_removed,tino pai very good im sure hell respond
spacex,not_removed,tino pai
spacex,not_removed,man what id give to be eligible sooner glad to hear theyre continuing to evolve the system
spacex,not_removed,do you mean livestreaming iac or their whole trip d
spacex,not_removed,except the asdss
spacex,not_removed,good write up man thanks so what are the benefits of methane on earth out of curiosity urocket posted about a month ago which listed significant potential benefits for using methane for launch from earth including cost the only thing i had to add was that the falcon uses large quantities of helium which is very expensive i think i saw a reference but cant find it now that the helium used in a falcon launch costs more than the liquid oxygen used for the launch in addition helium is relatively scarce on the earth and needed for applications such as mri and research and a full cadence of falcon launches would consume a noticeable fraction of the worlds helium production but rockets powered by raptor engines use heated propellant gas for pressurizing the tanks and therefore dont need helium a considerable additional cost saving
spacex,not_removed,there was the recent report of a raptor engine at mcgregor that apparently was a reduced size engine is there any reference for it being a reduced size engine that isnt just speculation by nonspacex people when the report came out i looked through the references and ultimately every question of the raptor engine being a reduced size model came from reader comments gwynne shotwell of spacex said a raptor had been sent to mcgregor said it was a great engine and didnt say anything about it being reduced size lets just say i would be dumbfounded and shocked if spacex had a rocket with a stage containing more than engines that needed to be fired at the same time simply based upon the history of rocketry even falcon has engine out capability for much of its flight falcon heavy should have this capability to a greater extent probably multiple engine out capability monitors the engines shuts an engine down if it goes bad and changes the instructions to the other engines to compensate has shielding between the engines so that a problem with one engine is less likely to affect its neighbors a very simple reliability model might assume that a failure of any one engine results in mission failure so for example if a single engine has probability of successful operation then the probability of mission success for a rocket is no better than to the power of or but intelligent use of design for redundancy can greatly improve those odds preferably to better than in the example given a limit of engines also puts an extreme lower limit on what the thrust of a raptor can possibly be it seems like the exact opposite that if you had tiny engines instead of then the thrust of each engine would have to be much less than for the model in order to get the total amount of thrust people are talking about
spacex,not_removed,they could easily fit the version of the raptor with a diameter engine bell isp would reduce from to but this would still be a useful improvement over the of the merlin vacuum engine the raptor vacuum engine would have a diameter bell which may just fit within the diameter outside diameter interstage but probably not worth the risk of a collision during stage separation
spacex,not_removed,another aussie and i live in sa so if they get a keynote like this one it would be hard to ignore might find this a hard act to follow
spacex,not_removed,martian dust isnt really that toxic it contains perchlorate chemicals which are related to bleach and can cause thyroid problems in high concentrations but are very easy to clean and control in a sealed environment it doesnt matter how toxic it is outside just how clean you can keep things inside perchlorates are completely non toxic to plant life and in fact there are many species of bacteria that will happily eat perchlorate chemicals and digest them into harmless salts all wed need to do is maintain a population of bacteria that can digest perchlorates and the colony would be selfcleaning in respect to those chemicals
spacex,not_removed,actually my intended point was that triconic can mean anything from a slightly rounded nose on a cylinder to a mercury capsule shape but yes in retrospect i should have read the original post more generously
spacex,not_removed,the amount of downvotes you are getting should be a clear indication the communtiy here disagrees with you
spacex,not_removed,can you show me where that is written i honestly want to know
spacex,not_removed,how come all your arguments are implying you know what the mods are thinking ive never seen them ban because of dissenting opinion if fact i believe one of the rules is you shouldnt even down vote a dissenting opinion i dont know where you come from being all of a sudden the voice for the community in your outrage if you dont like it and dont think it is fair then dont donate
spacex,not_removed,i could be wrong but theyre paying out of pocket and going no matter the outcome of the crowd fund
spacex,not_removed,open selection process this is not community funded money its individual members of the community choosing to donate money to uechologic and uthevehicledestroyer rspacex members who are going to the iac who also happen to be deservedlybeloved mods on this sub if you dont like that you dont have to donate this is not your tax dollars or your dues or your membership fees so im kind of gobsmacked that you seem to think that youre entitled to have a say in who gives money to whom heres what youre entitled to if you dont want your money going to mods then dont donate its that simple but please dont try to tell me what to do with my money if i want to donate to these guys in gratitude for all the hard work they put in here and i do how is it any of your business
spacex,not_removed,if we all paid a sub and that money was being used your point would have some validity as we are talking about crowd funding the money comes from enthusiastic donors given to people we have respect for i get that you dont want to give and that is absolutely your right not sure it gives you moral authority to criticise those who want to give or those who choose to ask for funds for what is a community purpose
spacex,not_removed,not a single comment in this thread has been removed if there are any removed comments would be less comments visible than indicated by the x comments link
spacex,not_removed,right now there are posts in this very thread being hidden you know you can just look for yourself which posts the mods delete there are ways to view those comments still and judge for yourself having been on the receiving end of or comment deletions sorry mods they were only deleted because i was replying with a joke instead of an actual answer to a question
spacex,not_removed,no you dont choose yourself to take trips with community funded money you choose yourself to fund your own trips to do work for the community and then offer that they can help you pay if they want to you would also like to know that there was an event a while back where the community chose a member of the community and he was crowdfunded to go to an event and get coverage
spacex,not_removed,spacex has been happy in the past to have the government help pay for things that they wanted to do anyway from the iac letter the technical presentation will focus on potential architectures for colonizing the red planet that industry government and the scientific community can collaborate on in the years ahead note some of the questions and answers at gwynne shotwells httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvktrlocauhqq at the small satellite conference my notes – q what considerations are being made for longduration human spaceflight in terms of the radiation environment risk of zerog a we are not currently working on those there are lots of organizations including nasa of course that are and hopefully well have the right answers by the time we have the vehicles ready to fly i dont want to say were ignoring it – were just not focused on that very important items though – q have you put in any thought yet on how you choose what types of people get to go to mars first besides just paying the money a weve talked about it we dont yet know what the criteria are obviously you have to pass some physical and probably mental health screens but we havent nailed that down yet hopefully others will have figured out the right kind of screening to do i dont think spacex would be displeased if nasa were to provide much of the program leadership and support with spacex providing the transportation somebody else helps solve a lot of the problems and helps to pay for it and spacex ends up with the ability to send people to mars sounds like a pretty good deal
spacex,not_removed,a plan to colonise mars that spacex could carryout largely on its own using funding from the sale of seats and spacexs own assets that is really truly unlikely
spacex,not_removed,chur
spacex,not_removed,the whole trip seems interesting too p
spacex,not_removed,which are named after fictional spacecraft
spacex,not_removed,in addition helium is relatively scarce on the earth and note that there are no known sources of helium on mars which is also a big argument to spacex you only have to isru refill a raptor based spaceship with lox and liquid methane
spacex,not_removed,the probability of mission success for a rocket is no better than to the power of or that is a chance of one engine failing if there is engine out capability those chances are closer to if there is engine out capability it is a lot better
spacex,not_removed,merlin vacuum has over diameter
spacex,not_removed,not at all the small trickle of downvotes proves my point mods have tailored posts so much that groupthink is very strong in here now it is getting sad how bad discussions can be when dissenting opinions are attacked even when they are right the worst is how when mods get upvotes automatically for posts that violate the rules on low quality posts i will only believe it is natural when every single person on her admit they know mods are hiding thousands of posts per month and have a double standard on opinions or post quality the problem is very very few people know this kind of heavy editorialization is going on due to the secret nature of ghosting a comment nothing i have said is false the idea that there are like people going around into deep comments attacking people who post facts should disturb you
spacex,not_removed,also being overlooked that if you completely ignore the mod status they are very valuable members of this community
spacex,not_removed,please dont hate on people who point out how much of a bad idea donating to people who heavily edit all posts and opinions on the subreddit if you actually think this is a good idea something is wrong they can do all the bad they want and hide all such comments calling them out from being visible that is a huge problem
spacex,not_removed,this chain of posts looks awfully like dejavu scroll to transparency and also hilarity since i cant direct link the root comment that got deleted
spacex,not_removed,each mod is hiding hundreds of posts a month exempting a single threadwe have no proof you are even doing this doesnt change anything
spacex,not_removed,its a good deal for everybody
spacex,not_removed,isnt it also the entire reason for spacexs existence though mars cult pretending to be a launch services provider very brief window of opportunity to make civilisation multiplanetary and all that
spacex,not_removed,that is a chance of one engine failing if there is engine out capability those chances are closer to if there is engine out capability it is a lot better i agree redundancy is great but it may take longer to figure out what to do for each contingency and program the rocket to do it for a falcon launch there may be as few as two engine failure scenarios for any particular time during the launch central engine fails or one of the outer engines fails but for a fh first stage with up to three engine out capability there are over potentially recoverable engine failure combinations even with various symmetries resulting in many of those combinations being similar to one another there are still many hundreds of engine out combinations that need to be considered and then the time of the engine failures must also be considered further increasing the complexity of evaluating the failure modes
spacex,not_removed,merlin vacuum has over diameter i agree but only just the merlin engines have a expansion ratio and the bell is in diameter so the throat diameter is the vacuum engine expansion ratio is so the bell diameter is so a little bit less than the projected raptor vacuum engine diameter of
spacex,not_removed,i fail to see your point this is an established event that two well known members of the community are attending the event is well documented and we can see the results further more by default an opinion cannot be right thats why its an opinion if people are willing to give money to someone else who they dont really know in return for absolutely nothing of material value then that should be their choice and in response to your earlier point that mods shouldnt be able to do something that a normal user cant of course they can thats the whole point of being a mod if you dont want to donate and you obviously dont then dont donate but suprisingly enough lots of us do want to support uechologic uthevehicledestroyer on their visit to the conference
spacex,not_removed,can you post these facts you speak about regarding mods making low effort posts that dont get removed
spacex,not_removed,knowing this moderation team i would think that if someone brought up a good claim that they were mishandling money theyd leave the post up and debate it in the open to prove their point about transparency if they werent being honest with money im sure the users here could find a completely open platform to discuss the issues with the mods however i really just dont see this happening you are entitled to your beliefs though and i dont see you changing your mind any time soon just wanted to throw my ¢ out there
spacex,not_removed,yeah were pretty sure this isnt the first time weve see devinely hes a persistant troll with a number of sockpuppet accounts and always tries to derail meta posts with the same tiresome predictable ramblings
spacex,not_removed,are you just trolling if not it seems like you havent been around this sub long andor havent had experience w the mods here
spacex,not_removed,and right here you lost your credibility
spacex,not_removed,spacex may at some point try going to mars on its own but only years after exhausting all other options they would have to be run by unthinking morons to forego the many billions tens of billions that government represents
spacex,not_removed,do you even know their real names how can they be well known they also censor any post they want that you never see so you have no idea what kind of mods they are actually even like
spacex,not_removed,yes you are free to look up echos history for the second week of january where he responds to someone else and admits he is hiding over comments a month if every mod is doing that that is over posts a month being scrubbed the problem is that they are passively hidden it doesnt show deleted so you have no idea the posts are hidden and no way to see what they were that means this subreddit is heavily editorialized by the mods you can sit there and downvote becuase you hate this reality but it is true whether you like it or not hiding comments is the number one mod tool these days in most subreddits they are all doing it it is bad enough that almost every thread is editorialized but when those mods with the power to control everything posted are soliciting for money it should be too much for anyone they whitewash all the threads so people like them then ask for money because of how great they are pretty damn crazy do you even know who they are in real life giving money should include disclosing who they are if they dont want to do that they should be letting someone else go
spacex,not_removed,listen to his seattle speech it is quite clear to me that at this time he had given up hope anybody else would start colonizing once he has built the transport infrastructure at that time he had decided that he himself would have to get the ball to colonization rolling
spacex,not_removed,this will be a gigantic bust if you are right i dont think you are this talk is supposed to be the architecture that space x is going to build in the next few years without any major government spending space x is going to mars with or without nasa if governments or nasa or big oil companies want to purchase additional bfrmct launches i am sure that can be arranged
spacex,not_removed,i know the real name of one of them and i will not be disclosing that
spacex,not_removed,can you highlight the section of that constitutes hidden postscomments i see a removed section and that shows up as removed it doesnt just disappear
spacex,not_removed,the ocd upside to the loss of last years dragon will mate with and will mate with it would have been before
spacex,not_removed,i was wondering why they stack adapters pma ida instead of replacing the pma with a cbm nds adapter does it help that the pma puts some distance between the iss and the docking spacecraft both the ida and the pma are adapters current configuration pma cbm ida nds suggested configuration cbm nds cbm common berthing mechanism used by the contract used by soyuz to dock nds nasa docking system used by commercial crew program httpsenwikipediaorgwikidockingandberthingofspacecraftadapters edit corrected cbs to cbm
spacex,not_removed,do we know yet what time the eva will start and the expected duration
spacex,not_removed,i was going to post the same thing perhaps the failure was meant to be it keeps things a lot simpler
spacex,not_removed,its upsetting noone foresaw that and decided to name the ground analog surely they need to keep a reference on the ground same as with a lot of space tech so the original that flew on wouldve been
spacex,not_removed,common berthing mechanism is commonly abbreviated as cbm not cbs they decided to keep the pma i believe as it achieves a nice standoff or gap between the actual module and the docking craft this was needed by the space shuttle so the pma was built with of length so that the shuttle wouldnt hit the iss this length also is required for the dream chaser to dock the ida just converts the to the nds so is a relatively simple device compared to one that would need to extend from the iss include pressurization and heatinginsulation components power transfer from the iss to the docking craft
spacex,not_removed,i am not an expert on this but the pma is basically the end cap of each module how do you move or replace the pma on a module without completely taking the end off the module and having to handle a full depressurization of that section i think they stack the adapters so that if they reconfigure the stationa fairly common activity they always have the same base adapter on each module otherwise you end up with a mixture of connections edit i stand corrected i thought the pma was a part of the module
spacex,not_removed,replacing the pma with a cbm nds adapter interesting factoid the previous plan from some years back was to do exactly that two httpiimgurcomsgkmuyvjpg was to launch on htv although there was a few advantages to that the advantages of the ida solution evidently was more important among them smaller and lighter adapter that could also fit in a dragon trunk much better clearances for visiting vehicles editadded bonus from
spacex,not_removed,they probably thought it would be financially and logistically impractical to design build launch and install a cbm nds adapter when they can instead just add a docking adapter to the two available pmas already on the station
spacex,not_removed,the first thing that came into my head was that if the most external adapter breaks horribly maybe you can release it and still have a potentially functional backup adapter underneath older tech sure
spacex,not_removed,i dont know if i would go that far it would have been a minor annoyance at most
spacex,not_removed,i think it really just doesnt matter that much the designations of individual modules probably isnt that big of a deal from a day to day operations standpoint im sure they have a comprehensive station configuration database that would make sorting that kind of thing out pretty trivial
spacex,not_removed,removing a pma doesnt require depressurization of the module it was attached to edit it does require depressurization of the pma itself though the pmas can be berthed and unberthed just like a dragon spacecraft for example
spacex,not_removed,pma is not the end cap for cbm they are docking adapters for the space shuttle cbm hatches are rounded square panels that are put on manually when necessary
spacex,not_removed,nope ids is mechanically incompatible with apas even disregarding the automated docking equipment and other noncritical features
spacex,not_removed,this by spacecom of tweet to national geographic you tube video mentioned in spacecom article text of article billionaire entrepreneur elon musk typically displays such an incredibly calm demeanor that its hard to imagine him getting excited about anything but in a newly released video musk makes an uncharacteristic display of emotion ranging from dread to unbridled joy as he watches a falcon reusable rocket booster make its historic first landing at cape canaveral florida on dec more elon musk shows childlike joy and dread in rocketlanding video elon musk showed childlike joy during the first historic landing of a falcon reusable rocket booster credit national geographic billionaire entrepreneur elon musk typically displays such an incredibly calm demeanor that its hard to imagine him getting excited about anything but in a newly released video musk makes an uncharacteristic display of emotion ranging from dread to unbridled joy as he watches a falcon reusable rocket booster make its historic first landing at cape canaveral florida on dec the video released by national geographic as part of its mars miniseries coverage shows neverbeforeseen footage of musk and members of the spacex team during the historic booster landing in an uncommon display of emotion and energy musk is seen running toward the control room exclaiming its standing up while most large rocket designs feature a first stage that is discarded after each launch the falcon first stage is designed to be reusable after kicking the payload skyward falcon first stage descends back toward earth with the help of thrusters and lands upright on a landing pad this is sometimes located on a barge moving with the swells of the ocean the falcon is the first orbital rocket to ever successfully land a reusable first stage booster after launch multiple falcon first stage boosters boosters crashed as they attempted to touch down on the landing platform before spacex made its first successful touchdown so its understandable when in the video musk looks panicked as he runs from the control room to a place outside where he can watch the booster descend toward the landing platform after it separates from the second stage and payload ok this is bad musk says as he looks skyward his face twisted into a strained look this is potentially bad but then the boosters thrusters kick on with a great burst of fire and the large metal cylinder begins to lower its legs as it approaches the landing site then in a moment that steals the breath of the spacex employees looking on the booster touches down and remains upright with childlike joy musk runs toward the control room not quite yelling its standing up holy smokes man musk almost whispers as he stares in awe at the video feed of the booster sitting quietly on the landing pad spacex has had multiple successful booster landings since that first one the video is not explicitly dated but the footage of the spacex employees watching the launch and the footage of the rocket itself are from the december landing the footage of the booster landing shows the rocket touching down on a landbased landing pad rather than a barge which took place on dec of that year national geographic included the musk video in its sixpart tv series which concluded monday dec that is part fictional drama and part documentary exploring humanitys pursuit of mars musk announced plans earlier this year to eventually help colonize the red planet you can learn more about national geographics mars project and the international mars science foundation at their multimedia website wwwmakemarshomecom

spacex,not_removed,meanwhile musk is thinking about meeting trump for this reason netizens are hopeful about the outcome of the meeting and they look forward for the partnership of elon musk and donald trump on mars exploration most especially when the two of them have the same penchant for business down to business on mars only hope d trump is shocked into action by the lowlow price
spacex,not_removed,mods this is a valid comment this is exciting
spacex,not_removed,the location google maps hasnt updated the imagery there yet for whatever reason i can see it in though funny that the building right next door belongs to none other than triumph group the company that elon is buying buildings from in hawthorne to expand their campus in fact the new dragon hatchery is apparently located in one of the old triumph buildings
spacex,not_removed,its great to see some progress on the constellation finally being made
spacex,not_removed,the warehousestyle space in the redmond ridge corporate center owned by mt partners is slated for a million interior remodeling job according to a permit application filed last month with king county looks like some tangible progress on the constellation
spacex,not_removed,a reasonable purpose for a second facility with lab space would be to start testing and optimizing for manufacturability to a great extent the success of the spacex internet satellite constellation will depend on the ability to design for efficient manufacture and to manufacture with high quality and low cost if thats correct then it implies that spacex is fairly happy with the progress of at least a large part of the basic designs
spacex,not_removed,should full scale production of satalites they would need quite the production line what are the odds elon would bring over tesla engineers that have built the gigafactory and model production lines to help out tesla odviously dosent know a thing about satelites but few companys would know more about fast and autonomous production lines for very complex products
spacex,not_removed,this makes me realize how well they are gonna have to engineer these satellites tiny cost savings will make a huge difference because you know theyre launching a lot of them imagine you find a design error when youve already launched a few hundred dang
spacex,not_removed,to a first approximation this implies that they are expecting to double the size of their satellite team in the near future this is very encouraging

spacex,not_removed,probably not a coincidence i guess the two companies were in contact and at some point triumph group was like hey i heard you guys were looking for a facility theres a great spot here it can be a coincidence but youve gotta realize how low the odds of that would be
spacex,not_removed,there is so much potential but so little news out of this spacex venture i dont want it to take a priority over the other activities invested towards this should move it at least a little bit
spacex,not_removed,wonder if we can get a copy of the permit sometimes they include details on what sort of job is gonna be done inside
spacex,not_removed,do you think this means that they finally figured out how to make an inexpensive pizza box design
spacex,not_removed,do they have the spectrum rights yet
spacex,not_removed,well compared to other things that are mass produced is quite small you just need to build a few today its not going to be a heavily automated line like all electronics board assembly would be robotic but i bet most of the rest will be by hand the key is you arent designing everything to just build the upfront development and tooling costs are spread across thats why they become so much cheaper per unit if iridium built units theyd be a lot cheaper too especially if they engineered them to be throw away like spacex is doing
spacex,not_removed,not as big of a problem as it might be for other satellites since they are slated to be constantly replaced every few years instead of lasting years if you discover a problem you can just iron it out for the next generation and the problem will be phased out relatively soon
spacex,not_removed,that doesnt really hold up yes its roughly doubling the total square feet spacex own in redmond but its an rd lab machinery and the like are prone to taking up more room than cubicles
spacex,not_removed,since spacex and triumph are both aerospace companies who presumably work in aerospace areas i bet the odds arent as low as one might think
spacex,not_removed,i dont want it to take a priority over the other activities i think the idea is that this activity will fund all the other activities
spacex,not_removed,project description interior tenant improvement to include new restrooms breakroom insulate walls ceilings and lighting mechanical is not included
spacex,not_removed,do you think this means that they finally figured out how to make an inexpensive pizza box design its an encouraging sign anyway back in august spacex seemed somewhat discouraged about the internet satellite constellation if we find a way to make the user terminal pizza box at a reasonable price then we can proceed now theyre renting a second facility the challenges for an inexpensive pizza box are largely of efficient manufacturing a large complex array of small physical components antenna and fast efficient signal processing which at those frequencies and bandwidths is also largely a layout issue so it could be that they basically know how to do it but need to set up prototype fabrication lines to see how well they can control cost yield the percentage of units made that work reliability etc
spacex,not_removed,do they have the spectrum rights yet i think getting spectrum rights was one of the goals for the for the spacex internet satellite constellation several companies are competing for the frequencies for satellite constellations and i think theres also a push to make them available for terrestrial applications spacex says that their design makes it possible to share the spectrum with other users and emphasizes social benefits of their technology hopefully the fcc will authorize spacex to use the spectrum for their constellation
spacex,not_removed,at the speed satelites are built today being on the spacex production line it would be like being on a rocket train it may not be fast but for the industry its unprecedented i would guess they would have as much automation as possible to reduce uncertainties between the satelites and reduce the long term capital investment as much as possible assuming they are in this for the long game
spacex,not_removed,a few additional factors to consider cost of the satellites is a significant factor in the cost and viability of the system units would be a very small production run compared to most manufactured items limiting economies of scale to some extent though it would be a very large run for production of satellites what they need to do is get the cost per satellite very low compared to other satellites for which i suspect they will want to minimize the hand work fortunately elon and his companies are becoming expert at manufacturing processes over at tesla he claims that theyre putting more effort into optimizing the design of the factories than into designing the cars so its likely that spacex will find ways to get considerable cost savings in the satellite production they will need considerably more user terminals pizza boxes than satellites i wouldnt be surprised if spacex decides to manufacture the pizza boxes inhouse even during full deployment
spacex,not_removed,units every years still not a huge manufacturing run
spacex,not_removed,i believe that is the gamechanging feature in this whole idea
spacex,not_removed,yes if they dont have any other funding the constellation can fund the whole its development even if the revenue is at the very low end of their expectations it would mean some delay though from the very optimistic time frame
spacex,not_removed,it gives hope to them funding the its development for sure
spacex,not_removed,sounds like a general office update nothing particularly techrelated just make it modern and attractive to help attract and retain talent its good to see this as a vote of confidence in continuing to pursue the venture though
spacex,not_removed,do we know if any floor space will be famous spacextesla white
spacex,not_removed,does elon ever play the short game overall watching the guy for several years he seems to only play the long game so far he is winning
spacex,not_removed,they will need considerably more user terminals pizza boxes than satellites i wouldnt be surprised if spacex decides to manufacture the pizza boxes inhouse even during full deployment the other way of doing things is to set a standard and let everyone build compatible user equipment by analogy musk doesnt expect all electric cars to be tesla but he does want all charging systems to be compatible it would also be easier to enter markets like china if chinese companies are building many of the user terminals this also allows manufacturers to design terminals compatible with competing networks the communications equivalent of compatible gpsglonassgalileo so avoid dependency and keep sovereignty many democratic countries will be wanting to muzzle the user terminals for their population but also do legitimate police work for their vips they may also want to have special terminals with private cryptography so avoiding suspicion of eavesdropping by usa intelligence this also allows faster and more flexible expansion of the user network and less need for capital once the system is up and running then you sit back and let the tollgates collect the money for its investment
spacex,not_removed,the article says it is lab space so labs and workshops that means such flooring is very likely
spacex,not_removed,assuming that this is the display model first landing right will they stand it up with its legs deployed what a great thing to put right beside your main facility what a photoop for space nerds
spacex,not_removed,so it doesnt have dummy engines at least not yet maybe they can let that slide since its on guardedfenced off property or they gutted them either way its cool that they have most of the original engines dummys just wouldnt have been as cool
spacex,not_removed,photos were taken this afternoon its out of the transport structurehold and is a ways down the street from the spacex building in what looks like a parking lot
spacex,not_removed,wonder how much more processing and inspection theyll do at hawthorne before going to its final showcase location
spacex,not_removed,my family is taking a vacation to california starting july staying in la for the first few days so im hoping saunter on by the spacex facility and see this thing hopefully itll be visible from the street
spacex,not_removed,was it established what the other rocket was out out on the road with it fh centre core test article was the highest bidder from what i can recall
spacex,not_removed,sorry if this has already been asked but does anyone know what that casing running the length of the booster is for first i thought it was for fuel lines like the atlas v but afaik they are all internal
spacex,not_removed,are they going to but the control fins back on
spacex,not_removed,as always progress will it head back inside at all
spacex,not_removed,it will need the faa red clearance light on top being that close to hawthorne airport

spacex,not_removed,eep i cannot wait to see her irl i hope you can get enough to get a good feel
spacex,not_removed,the plan is to display it upright with legs deployed
spacex,not_removed,i think it would be cool if they set it up suspended over the ground with the legs out and the rocket at a slight angle as if it were half a second from landing people could walk right underneath it but keep it out of arms reach since people do dumb things you could stand right in line with the engines and really get a look at the business end
spacex,not_removed,i dont really get why seeing the engines would be itar sensitive the principles behind merlin are very much understood by anyone involved in rocket propulsion there is nothing secret about how it works
spacex,not_removed,for anyone interested
spacex,not_removed,that had to be to get that rocket into the parking lot so the one i linked would be easyer pardon the pun note the gate near stage is has a lot around it
spacex,not_removed,id imagine theyre gonna put the legs back on the booster for the showcase so at least that much most likely
spacex,not_removed,unless they move it in the next few days it should be visible
spacex,not_removed,the rocket being a fh test article is the best guess right now i dont believe anyone has seen it since it was at hawthorne
spacex,not_removed,there are two raceways down opposite sides containing wiring harnesses and a lot of plumbing especially to carry cold helium from the copv tanks down to the merlins where heat exchangers warm it up to be sent back up for tank ullage that sort of stuff
spacex,not_removed,im a bit late but it also houses the fts that unzips the rocket with explosive charges
spacex,not_removed,would be a poor display model without them but perhaps theyre going to put on better looking ones than the ones that lost their ablative coating
spacex,not_removed,i cant see then do this as it would be pretty difficult to suspend it
spacex,not_removed,as if government regulations paid any attention to common sense
spacex,not_removed,it seems like musk had said they had either rented or purchased space from triumph anyone know how much
spacex,not_removed,the fb group has assets in mcgregor waiting for it to show up in the structural test fixture next to the tripod
spacex,not_removed,i dont know the dollar amount but i do know spacex ownsleases the building just north of the and the giant one to the east when i left they were starting to move equipment and people over there plus thats where we had our holiday party in december i believe that is the dragon hatchery where mostall of dragon production will go
spacex,not_removed,dragon hatchery that is just a fabulous name for that part of the factory id never heard it used before
spacex,not_removed,nonsense and balderdash the appearance of all sorts of test articles has been spotted from the public roads one of the most interesting was the lox dunk tank being used for pull tests on copv tanks when the center core fh test article shows up the date of its arrival cant be any sort of trade secret nor can the date of departure if they dont want it seen they can put up tarps what they cant do and this was recently discussed on fb after an incident is for the contract security dudes to come offproperty and demand a photographer one of my members cease taking pics from those public roads and then further threaten to call mcgregor law enforcement theyve been reeducated no law was broken photographers have rights have you been listening to the tsa too much a pic i took on my last visit to the site
spacex,not_removed,yea they have other cute names for the buildings they ownlease such as boom room and xbox most other buildings are simple names such copv composite overwrapped pressure vessel ndt nondestructive testing or shipping receiving
spacex,not_removed,you read all that into one funny word i could just have easily used stalkers paparazzi or stringers to imply we were obsessed groupies or journalists is this a nohumor zone ill learn
spacex,not_removed,the system will also employ optical intersatellite links for seamless network management and continuity of service emphasis added which will also aid in complying with emissions constraints designed to facilitate spectrum sharing with other systems low interference coms should assist spacex in any battle for frequencies with competing satellite constellations
spacex,not_removed,hi we discussed whether to leave this up or not but decided in the end we didnt feel it represented the current status of the subreddit fairly enough the subreddit currently is undergoing a drought of content thats rather hard to ignore but i think the reasoning in this post is faulty its not because weve tightened the belt or found religion its because the company this subreddit follows in its entirety hasnt done anything significant in a whole month theyre on standdown and we highly disagree that the rules the subreddit has voted on should be relaxed to fill a void we should all be able to live with for a little longer we watched barges go by restaurants hard to do when the barges are sitting empty waiting for rockets the only thing to watch for now is cruise ships the same thing goes for the rest of your points theres nothing stopping someone from doing a simulation writing a thorough selfpost or making an infographic moderators can shape a subreddit but only if were given something to shape in the first place the kerfuffle following guadalajara was unfortunately timed but unrelated bedtime has not moved neither have the goalposts its not like we enjoy having little to discuss we dont get off on removing comments or posts it sucks every time its necessary i empathize with your annoyance i cannot sympathize with your explanation thats all

spacex,not_removed,i just want to tell you that youre incredible ive followed your photographs since you first started posting on reddit you were good when you started and you keep getting better every launch honestly these are fantastic also how do you get these processed and uploaded so quickly
spacex,not_removed,this is amazing not only did they launch it but they also landed it amazingly close to the center yet again
spacex,not_removed,what an awesome photo i like how theres a big cloud of exhaust being pushed to the left is there some kind of structure built into the launch pad that directs the exhaust to flow in that direction or is it just doing that on its own
spacex,not_removed,‪today march marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one for the space flight industry thank you elon musk and the incredible employees at spacex for making this a reality what a day guys what a day great photo btw
spacex,not_removed,nice shot
spacex,not_removed,excellent now keep going
spacex,not_removed,congratulations spacex well done boy did that stage come in hot you could see the grid fins glowingburning after the reentry burn but it landed just fine amazing
spacex,not_removed,what a welcome back for pad i bet a lot of people whose work has launched from there over the years are smiling right now absolutely beautiful
spacex,not_removed,i had no doubt this launch and landing would go off without a hitch the hosted webcast really made the case for rapid reuse as elon said on twitter incredibly proud of the spacex team for achieving this milestone in space next goal is reflight within hours flight proven boosters are safer than expendable ones elon can now make a satellite constellation of any size since he has the lowest cost access to space and any potential rival depends on him for access to space
spacex,not_removed,nice photo i like how the plume reaches to the edge of the tower so we dont loose any detail of the tower nice use of the rule of thirds i bet those birds were really scared p
spacex,not_removed,did you have a camera close to the pad this time if so how long does that take to collect sorry if this has been asked a million times before just excited to see the photos
spacex,not_removed,how excited for your remote cam pics are you edit just saw the clarification you cant till your thats lame
spacex,not_removed,awesome
spacex,not_removed,where did you watch the launch from incredible view
spacex,not_removed,thanks so much computer was ready to go inside the conference room that led to the balcony where i was shooting everything was typed up in advance
spacex,not_removed,yes they have a tunnel redirecting it
spacex,not_removed,yes there is a trench under the pad to redirect the exhaust
spacex,not_removed,here are photos of the launchpad where you can see the flame trench
spacex,not_removed,no remotes today just telephoto
spacex,not_removed,the saturn v center
spacex,not_removed,wow that second photo i dont know ive ever noticed or appreciated the amazing lines of the strongback and to see it from this angle perfectly aligned makes it look apart of falcon
spacex,not_removed,cant wait until you are old enough to start shooting those again thanks for the great pics as usual
spacex,not_removed,thats a shame were you not allowed to or whats the go there thanks anyway awesome photos as usual cant wait for more processed ones
spacex,not_removed,alright thanks
spacex,not_removed,cant go until im unfortunately
spacex,not_removed,hi your submission was removed from rspacex for breaking our httpwwwredditcomrspacexwikirules submit in a thread if one exists please post simple questions to the ask anything questions thread thanks for understanding this is so we can keep rspacex the very best spacex discussion board on the internet if you feel this removal was made in error please about the removal of my submission
spacex,not_removed,from now on well be surprised when spacex doesnt land one of its rockets sounds about right
spacex,not_removed,but arguably the most important part of the launch happened before the satellite was deployed which happened at pm et eh this is still experimental landing so mission success is paramount i would agree that it is the most entertaining part of the launch this landing was particularly tricky because the rocket went high into geostationary orbit like the last one did on may are they saying the first stage went into geostationary orbit
spacex,not_removed,welcome back from mars hows everything there
spacex,not_removed,im not quite there yet but seeing it stick the landing at close to max design speed was definitely a good benchmark under those landing conditions i am very excited to see them push the limits on landings in high wind choppy conditions
spacex,not_removed,well technically the second stage is also a rocket so sure some part of the rocket went as high as geostationary orbit though not in geostationary orbit obviously but rather in a geostationary transfer orbit
spacex,not_removed,caption after each rocket landing we gain the chance to inspect hardware that has survived the rigors of getting to space and back like this merlin engine from a recently landed firststage by doing this we gain new knowledge that helps move us closer towards achieving full and rapid reusability
spacex,not_removed,heres a list of components that i recognize in the center we can see main combustion chamber of to the left we are seeing part of one of the hydraulic arms that moves the engine and thus implements gimbaling thrust vectoring the two ports next to the gimbaling attachment are i believe temperature and pressure measurement ports but im not sure about that btw heres an image of a httpwwwspacexcomsitesspacexfilesmerlinverticaljpg just because its so cool 🙂
spacex,not_removed,this picture makes me giddy inside ill be honest in saying that i did not believe spacex would be landing rockets this soon i am so glad they proved me wrong because theyve helped show everyone including myself that nothing is impossible if you work hard enough for it this is the future

spacex,not_removed,this raises a question that i never considered before how effective would a used combustion chamber and nozzle be as a bell like a literal bell that you ring with a hammer
spacex,not_removed,i want this tape
spacex,not_removed,i like how theyve got some custom flown hardware tape now like theyve got so much flown hardware coming back that they dont have time to write on it with a pen

spacex,not_removed,honestly given how expensive spaceflight is its mind blowing how long it took to truly be able to be able to inspect flown hardware ie first stage components apart from upper lunar etc stages designed to reenter and survive edit til you guys are awesome then i guess it was more in the way to be able to inspect flown first stage hardware that came down propulsively under its own power cheers
spacex,not_removed,where can i get some flown hardware tape where did they get flown hardware tape
spacex,not_removed,any ideas on what this is and not just flown
spacex,not_removed,ha they have to label used hardware to not confuse it with new the myth of the destruction of hardware in orbital flight is crashing to the ground any doubtful customer can now see for themselves the dollars will make many reused launches the industry practice a big inventory will soon cease core and engine production and so slash the million usd annual cost so further rolling to the promised reusable cost goals
spacex,not_removed,from a recently landed firststage just a beautiful statement
spacex,not_removed,you also see the helium line on the top right not sure if the pipe with the blue clamp is a helium line but it may well be
spacex,not_removed,very cool in that httpwwwspacexcomsitesspacexfilesmerlinverticaljpg what is that secondary exhaust on the right side are those present on flight hardware or is that just for the test
spacex,not_removed,awesome picture crazy to think these were expected to just be thrown away every launch
spacex,not_removed,this needs to be in more subs
spacex,not_removed,not very effective bells are made of materials that have distinct resident frequencies energy efficient vibration rates so they ring at specific tones engine bells do the exact opposite they try to have low vibration efficiency to prevent them from vibrating to pieces under high energy load
spacex,not_removed,very interesting question i believe the nozzle extender of the mvac can probably be rung i think on the webcast we can sometimes see it ringing the key for good sound generation by church bells is rotational symmetry so that standing waves are generated and thats very much the case for the i believe a rocket engine combustion chamber and nozzle when rung with a hammer would probably make a very interesting sound not heard on church bells as the combustion chamber probably generates a prominent standing wave at a very specific frequency and its harmonics one other detail are the hydraulic connections that probably mute the sound somewhat but theres only one way to find out 🙂
spacex,not_removed,you could order it yourself from a custom tape manufacturer which is probably what spacex did but it wouldnt be cheap from a quick search it looks like you typically have to order at least rolls of tape for a total cost of nearly
spacex,not_removed,the ssme which flew on the shuttle for over years was designed to survive
spacex,not_removed,quite a few rocket components have actually been recovered before just not reused ariane srbs are occasionally recovered by parachute the boosters on the first energia launch were parachuted back and most russian and chinese rockets are disposed of over land and recovered for scrap and even without any intentional controlled landing theyre generally intact enough to study theres been plenty of opportunities for flown first stages to be analyzed
spacex,not_removed,this is a combustion chamber on httpwwwspacexcomsitesspacexfilesshinymerlineditedjpg
spacex,not_removed,when stages are reused core production will not cease for good all airframes if you wanna call it that have a life expectancy they will have to be retired and replaced sooner or later
spacex,not_removed,the flight hardware is also the flightproven hardware therefore worth more as its known working
spacex,not_removed,the best part is they have to specify that its a recently landed first stage you know not to be confused with all the ones that were landed in the more distant past
spacex,not_removed,i also think at the top of the picture we get a rare glimpse at the injector albeit of its less interesting outer side heres the with the injectors clearly visible its the hydrolox upper stage engine esca of the ariane upper stage ie a topnotch high efficiency rocket engine with an isp of seconds with a thrust of tonsforce spacex reportedly uses different simpler pintle injectors
spacex,not_removed,i think the diameter is too big for a helium line
spacex,not_removed,its the turbo pump exhaust
spacex,not_removed,if you have any specific subreddits in mind ill gladly try to make it happen
spacex,not_removed,bells are made of materials that have distinct resident frequencies energy efficient vibration rates so they ring at specific tones engine bells do the exact opposite they try to have low vibration efficiency to prevent them from vibrating to pieces under high energy load but resonant frequencies of such pressure vessels are pressure dependent a combustion chamber and engine bell is much more stiff if under bar of pressure which significantly raises resonant frequencies resonant frequencies are typically addressed by making the combustion chamber and the nozzle stiff enough and via a range of other measures that weaken pressure driven and combustionevaporation driven feedback loops and sometimes by adding inlays to the combustion chamber but by virtue of them being significant pressure vessels their stiffness is usually a natural property of them especially under pressure do you know of any historic example perhaps where a rocket engine bell had to be stiffened to avoid simple acoustic vibrations how they behave under bar sl pressure is an entirely different matter as one example take for example the mvac nozzle extender which afaik is only mm thick at its thinnest part and follows a nozzle contour which contour is not designed to prevent vibrations but is designed for optimal expansion and for avoidance of flow separation yet the nozzle extender clearly survives vibrationally not because its shape or thickness is tuned against any sl selffrequencies but because operational pressure is high enough to stiffen its structure and thus raise all resonant frequencies well above the characteristic frequency of thrust fluctuations no doubt rocket nozzles are not musical instruments in any way but id not be surprised to hear the mvac nozzle extender gong in a pretty pleasant fashion if it was hit gently with a hammer
spacex,not_removed,many rocket components are especially designed to effectively damp vibrations i would expect it to be the exact opposite they would not make good bells at all
spacex,not_removed,i believe the nozzle extender of the mvac can probably be rung i think on the webcast we can sometimes see it ringing i think so too but couldnt completely rule out image capture artifacts from vibrating camera mount combined with rolling shutter effect in the camera varying blooming of the bright part of the image as the flames vary in brightness ill keep an eye out for video that appears to rule out these other possibilities unambiguous wobbling of the bell
spacex,not_removed,knowing spacex they probably built their own tape machines because they know theyll be using a lot of it s
spacex,not_removed,and even though the ssme was very expensive its an amazing rocket engine
spacex,not_removed,it was designed to do so but still required extensive maintenance between each flight as a whole the shuttle required considerably more maintenance between flights than was originally planned or expected
spacex,not_removed,and the gimballing actuator on the left side i presume
spacex,not_removed,maybe they eventually only make cores etc for three months of the year for replacements
spacex,not_removed,nah at least not at first sure it might be good but the stress put on it from the flight has reduced its life span and made it more likely it will fail next time or at least may have new hardware is well understood the risks are well understood in the long term we may decide that this is safer we arent their yet and spacex will have to price in the added risk
spacex,not_removed,ill be more happy when they need to differentiate between first and second stages in their landed hardware descriptions
spacex,not_removed,httpwwwspacexcomsitesspacexfilesshinymerlineditedjpg not as rare as a view of the and lox pumps on the turbopump
spacex,not_removed,pintle injectors while simple have many advantages though also whered you find that pic of the esca injector id like to see more
spacex,not_removed,that is an coaxial injector spacex uses a pintle injector pulled httpimgurcomaylvpq from google provided by this cant say how similar this pintle injector design is to spacexs injector design but its the same basic concept somehow missed this in the original comment it looks like the lox dome takes up a large area around the centerline of the engine i wonder if the rp is injected from near the periphery acting almost as a film cooling layer for the injector face and the lox dome to help prevent boiling and over pressure in the lox dome during really deep throttling changed wording for clarity
spacex,not_removed,what else would do you think it would be where do you think that line is going and what its doing having anything other than helium makes no sense to me because there are other places to bleed off of if its
spacex,not_removed,it could perhaps be the coolingheatexchanger duct of the turbine combustion chamber pressurized by the turbopump but this is just a guess
spacex,not_removed,yes and my understanding is that the exhaust is black because combustion is fuelrich to keep temperatures down since only a fraction of the fuel is burned in the turbine low temperature is more important than the highest possible efficiency having said that on the upper stage engine that black exhaust is further led into the main nozzle via a turbine exhaust manifold where it filmcools the niobium nozzle extender from the inside that exhaust streaming down the inside of the nozzle extender is what is causing some of the that can be seen in the spacex launch webcast the other sharper edged dark streaks are welding seams i believe all speculation as usual
spacex,not_removed,if the mvac nozzle extension is thinner than a soda can wouldnt it just go spat like hitting a sheet of paper and someone would give you a swift kick in the tush for messing with flight hardware
spacex,not_removed,the nozzle extension has a stiffening ring that flies off after engine start clearly in videos is used exactly for assent stiffening i would not be surprised at all if the nozzle extention can ring its single ply single material when i made my post i was thinking about the nozzle that has much more complex geometry that would lead to poor energy transfer acustic im under the impression that the mvac nozzle actually inflates due to its operation pressure and temp think theory only
spacex,not_removed,many rocket components are especially designed to effectively damp vibrations maybe but a combustion chamber under bars of pressure is much more stiff than under bar atmospheric pressure for example the mvac nozzle extender is so thin and weak that you could probably bend it by hand yet when pressurized by the exhaust it becomes super strong and stable most of the vibrations in a rocket engine deal with positive feedback loop oscillations in the thrust which if it gets out of hand can shake apart a rocket engine but the main method to fight those have very little to do with the sl pressure air acoustic selfharmonics of the engine bell and combustion chamber but with injector pressure levels atomization spray patterns and the shape of the combustion chamber most of the wall mass of a rocket engine combustion chamber is due to it being a bar pressure vessel id expect the combustion chamber and in particular the nozzle to ring pretty nicely because both are essentially a robustly cast single block of metal crystal with outer liners especially if hung down from above im curious has anyone ever tried that when working on a or a mvac i bet its hard to avoid any contact with the engine bell so there must have been a number of natural experiments performed already edit fix
spacex,not_removed,the tape supplier got cheeky so they vertically integrated
spacex,not_removed,i know i specifically left that point out of my comment to see how long itd take someone to note this apparently under minutes
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,yep looks like it
spacex,not_removed,economics state they would slow down production not segment it into a certain part of the year
spacex,not_removed,or first time landed and second time landed
spacex,not_removed,so where in that picture are the pumps and the turbopump to me rocket engines just look like a huge mess of tubing and wiring except for a unique parts
spacex,not_removed,for those interested an excellent overview of pintle injectors and their advantages can be found in httpwwwrocketpropulsioninforesourcesarticlestrwpintleenginepdf
spacex,not_removed,coaxial injector is quite different from pintle injector example schematic
spacex,not_removed,its for pressurization of the propellant tanks one needs to heat up the helium its stored very cold to save space to be an effective pressurant it gets heated by the turbine exhaust in the turbopump exhaust pipe in a heat exchanger i mean you can have a fuck ton of cold helium to be used as pressurant without heating it up but thats just sloppy engineering if you can pass it through a heat exchanger
spacex,not_removed,if the mvac nozzle extension is thinner than a soda can i dont think it is the mvac nozzle is mm thick afaik while the wall of a typical soda can is about thick ie more than an order of magnitude thinner wouldnt it just go spat like hitting a sheet of paper i dont think so i tried it out a similarly sized piece of metal and it didnt go spat it gave a kind of a dirty gong the mvac nozzle extender would be a deeper and cleaner gong i think and someone would give you a swift kick in the tush for messing with flight hardware i think that outcome is a given regardless of the kind of sound the nozzle emits 😎
spacex,not_removed,the nozzle extension has a stiffening ring that flies off after engine start clearly in videos is used exactly for assent stiffening yes but thats protecting the very long nozzle extender against flexing sideways against the wall of the interstage which forces are supposedly stronger than any weird musical experiments wed perform on it im under the impression that the mvac nozzle actually inflates due to its operation pressure and temp think theory only since its glowing hot near its melting point i suspect thats a pretty good likelihood
spacex,not_removed,bars of pressure is much more stiff than under bar atmospheric pressure assuming you really mean bar no pressure difference between the inside and outside of the bell as when engine is not running also i would expect the static pressure to vary even down to or less at the outlet of the bell near sea level
spacex,not_removed,if the bell is all floppy until it is put under pressure then surely that would count against ringing
spacex,not_removed,you know how rspacex is
spacex,not_removed,haha i just got lucky and happen to catch the comment as i was browsing reddit and waiting for a query to complete i was surprised you didnt add the detail on your own good to know it was intentional
spacex,not_removed,probably on a cart somewhere off screen its not actually in the picture i was just point out the injector assembly thats clearly visible on the top of the chamber
spacex,not_removed,ah yes i love that paper its pretty amazing stuff
spacex,not_removed,thats what i was pointing out
spacex,not_removed,heating the helium to get pressurization doesnt sound right to me the helium is stored in a high pressure composite overwrapped pressure vessel inside the lox tank probably at close to or psi heating helium will obviously increase its pressure in proportional to its absolute temperature but is the complication of heating it to get the increase worth the extra complication this feels dubious to me firstly because the hot helium injected back into the lox tank is going to cool very rapidly thus loosing the benefit of heating secondly i have to wonder how much pressure is needed particularly as the relative tank pressure will go up as the rocket ascends and external pressure drops and will go up even more as the core descends and is heated by reentry could the pipe be a pressurized hydraulic line used to gimbal the engine
spacex,not_removed,makes sense and this way it also cools the turbine chamber right
spacex,not_removed,i suspect it is because the cooling gas is injected into the nozzle through a set of evenly spaced pinholes and then because all the exhaust gasses are flowing so quickly away from the combustion chamber you end up with a streak of cooler metal starting where the pinhole injects the cooling gas and flowing down from there at least thats similar to airplane jet engines that ive seen torn down for maintenance so i suspect they could use a similar technique but iamnotarocketscientist
spacex,not_removed,why are the streaks in such perfectly straight lines with equal clearances between them a few months ago i outlined a similar theory as uskydiver the gaseous exhaust of the turbine is let into a toroid manifold which has holes pointing down the variable diameter of the toroid is set so that pressure drops evenly and every hole emits roughly the same mass flow of exhaust if the toroid had constant diameter then the holes closer to the intake would probably emit more gas than the ones farther out the evenly distributed holes have two roles they evenly distribute the coolant but they also balance out the nontrivial amount of thrust that the turbine produces the turbine is a small rocket engine after all doing so not just cools the nozzle extension but possibly contributes a small amount of thrust as well
spacex,not_removed,if the bell is all floppy until it is put under pressure then surely that would count against ringing what matters is whether the free part is rotationally symmetric or not so that standing waves can be created i have just tried it out with a number of thin walled floppy aluminum ducts the rotationally symmetric ones chime pretty well as long as they are held up near their axis and are hung down so id definitely expect the mvac niobium nozzle extender to ring with a pleasant rich deep gong as long as its not standing on the floor that is
spacex,not_removed,they also reused the srbs
spacex,not_removed,i managed to overlook the links somehow consequently my intent was to disambiguate the wording whether third sentence refers to second or first reading it now it doed not seem in need of clarification
spacex,not_removed,look at this picture the brown lines on the top left are the hydraulic lines on the other side of the engine tell me what you think the metal lines are going into the turbine assembly is for those lines exist and are heating some fluid up pvnrt higher the temperature of the gas the higher the pressure is at when its at a higher volume container the helium tanks in the lox tank are pressurizing both the and lox tanks they are huge being pressurized by relatively small he tanks you still need to have a ullage pressure of about psi in the tanks how is that maintained as the ullage volume increases especially near burnout
spacex,not_removed,its in the section where the gasses have already been expanded and have done work so the temperature its at when it heats the helium is relatively significantly lower than when it came out of the gas generator so i highly doubt its being used for cooling
spacex,not_removed,please please can we just try and see im curious now im coming to visit
spacex,not_removed,also after much refurbishment to deal with the issues related to being dunked in salt water
spacex,not_removed,which are little more than fancy steel tubes ok very fancy but on a complexity scale of with a skyrocket being and the ssme being the merlin is probably about a and the srbs are maybe
spacex,not_removed,ok i agree that the tank pressurization is helium heated heated in a heat exchanger in the turbo pump exhaust in the picture you linked that makes them the lower two pipes but those arnt what we are looking at in the flown hardware picture we are looking at the pipe to the left of them i do however agree that the brown lines in the picture you linked are the pipes probably flexible powering one of the gimbaling solenoids i guess there are another two out of sight on the second solenoid the high pressure to drive them is coming from the turbo pump but whether this comes directly from the pump or elsewhere in the system is anyones guess another possibility is that what we are seeing in the flown hardware picture is the helium line used to spin up the turbo pump thinking about it we know they test gimballing before launch i wonder if they lightly spin the turbo pump with helium to generate the hydraulic pressure if this were the case you would definitely take pressurized hydraulic directly from the turbo pump so the mysterious line could be helium or
spacex,not_removed,well since its a heat exchanger it will have to cool something just not the chamber but the exhaust right this can be useful on the mvac where the turbine exhaust is used to cool the nozzle extender
spacex,not_removed,ive always thought of gas film cooling as providing a layer of cool gas to maximize the temperature gradient within the boundary layer i suppose more effective film cooling is a side effect of cooler exhaust
spacex,not_removed,thanks for the great questions everyone elon musks ama is now over to make it easier to find his answers this thread is sorted by qa
spacex,not_removed,do you see the exploration and settlement of antarctica as an analog for how we will get to mars alternatively do you feel a sense of urgency to get humanity to mars
spacex,not_removed,what equipment and procedures will be required for refueling operations on mars will they be designed to function autonomously for the initial unmanned test flight also are there any plans to introduce a third variant of the its with just a large shuttlelike payload bay to allow for transporting bulkier cargo
spacex,not_removed,its booster engine placement design question the tight cluster of engines of the its booster cool number 😉 has created speculation on this sub that maybe they are packed so tighty because that way theres a virtual nozzle or virtual aerospike effect they can take advantage of they can have shorter nozzles while most of the exhaust momentum of the inner engines is still axial is there any truth to this speculation or is the tight packing done purely to scale up liftoff twr members of this sub are torn and conflicted some suggest its possible some think its physically impossible to have any such thrust increase effect with an exhaust that has hipersonic velocities
spacex,not_removed,overall is the landing architecture of its booster and distances needed to be covered to be same as falcon s boostback reentry burn landing burn could you give us nuggets on what changes the final falcon version you mentioned will have uprated engines obviously from to lbf but what else is it mostly geared towards reusabilty over performance gwynne mentioned weeks ago that will be reused only once or twice while should be reused up to times can you talk about what are the limiting factors for falcon reuse
spacex,not_removed,hi elon its question what spacex technologymaterial still requires the most development for its to be a success thank you
spacex,not_removed,i think one of the most shocking things in your its presentation for many people was the full size carbon fiber tank spacex built it is for those who havent seen it can you tell us a little bit more about the design construction and role of that particular test article
spacex,not_removed,its spaceship design question ii the its spaceship has the whole tank design looks very exciting and theres rampant speculation on this sub about the purpose of those spherical tanks are they for landing fuel or are they storing hot gaseous propellants as part of the autogenous propellant pressurization system or are they used for onorbit propellant densification to store vapor before its liquefied again all of the above perhaps 😀
spacex,not_removed,hi elon and many thanks for doing this today what level of completion is the interior habitable area layout of its at and when might we expect to see renderings of it
spacex,not_removed,its spaceship capabilities question ii the its spaceship has a δv budget of kms when returning from mars to earth with tons of payload with a much smaller payload it has a δv budget in excess of kms which is amazing could this unprecedented amount of δv be used to fly between mars and earth even outside the launch windows enforced by the synodic period when payload mass is not a primary factor it could be used for emergency purposes such as medical suppliesinstruments and experts or for other high priority but low mass cargo like critical replacements
spacex,not_removed,hi elon ive got questions on the its vehicle specs can you divulge what the vacuum thrustisp figures are for the sealevel raptor variant the its booster is able to hover will it ever use this capability to better ensure a successful landing at the expense of some small gravity losses or is it hoverslams all the way what is the expected maximum acceleration that the its booster can withstand during entrylanding thanks for everything
spacex,not_removed,we got a pretty good idea of what a mars edl looks like but can you explain how the its and the tanker plan to do an earth edl having talked with you at iac about the mars entry we learned that theres very powerful thrusters that can handle attitude control these work great for the martian atmosphere but what about on earth there doesnt appear to be grid fins and the thrusters obviously have less authority here on earth so whats the trick thanks for your time tim dodd httpinstagramcomeverydayastronaut

spacex,not_removed,its spaceship capabilities question i according to your iac presentation the its per launch cost are which would be an order of magnitude launch cost improvement even if the its was used only with falcon sized payloads can the its spaceship put satellitesorbiters into orbit around earth mars venus or jupiter
spacex,not_removed,its tanker on orbit propellant refilling question i in the its video we can see how the its tanker snugs up to the its spaceship and httpimgurcomayacdk no attitude or main thruster action can be seen during this operation can the its spaceship tanks be refilled in zero gee or will the refilling process use thrusters to settle propellants
spacex,not_removed,hey elon what plans do you have for mitigating exposure to cosmic radiation once its is past the van allen belt what about the surface of mars
spacex,not_removed,how far into its design and testing can spacex get in the next years without major funding support from third parties
spacex,not_removed,the water on mars is not trivial to access how long do you expect isru to take to create enough fuel for the return flight also is there evidence of a water cycle to replenish used water resources near any settlement or will isru have to constantly expand its area of resource exploitation
spacex,not_removed,hi elon what kind of protection against micrometeorites does its have as a follow up is the huge window an additional risk factor
spacex,not_removed,its tanker on orbit propellant refilling question ii the its tanker has an amazing propellant load of tons and can also lift another tons of propellant for onorbit refilling will the its tanker carry its tons of propellant in its stretched main tanks or does it use special separate propellant refilling tanks in the nose section
spacex,not_removed,have you designed or built any other its hardware besides the tank and the raptor
spacex,not_removed,its tanker design question the its tanker has a fantastically low dry mass of its external outline is httpimgurcomayacdk but without windows does the its tanker use the cargo and crew section of the spaceship to have extra tanks for in orbit propellant refilling or are its main tanks stretched up into the cargocrew section
spacex,not_removed,my question what happens if the crewed its vehicle has a pad or in flight abort calculations have shown that even with all engines running on the second stage surface and vacuum raptors the ship would only have a twr of about significantly lower than a standars les on crew dragon or soyuz
spacex,not_removed,will spacex build its own communication relay satellites for mars orbit or
spacex,not_removed,thank you very much for taking the time to answer some begging questions from the community how will bfr be brought out to the pad assuming it is vertically integrated based off the iac video i would guess it needs a crawler or maybe a mobile launch platform where will bfr be assembled has spacex considered bidding for use of the vab it is definitely tall enough to house bfrits will there be a secondary launch site outfitted for bfr perhaps boca chica or pad
spacex,not_removed,its spaceship design question i the its spaceship is a stunningly beautiful smooth unified design that httpimgurcomauclno while designing the its launch system was there any early stage of the mct design process where you have seriously considered a more modular more utilitarian design where cargopayloadcrew sections are modules that can be attached to a standalone enginestanks block or is modularity a bad idea in this context with an unacceptably high mass cost for spaceships
spacex,not_removed,regarding the itstanker fuel transfer there are a number of challenges with operating a pump in microgravity with a mixed gasliquid medium especially cryogenic fuels clearly nothing of this magnitude has ever been attempted before how does your team plan to accomplish this
spacex,not_removed,hi elon it sounds like youll just be providing the transport what other parts of the system would you like to see other companies start to develop
spacex,not_removed,do you plan on setting up a communication infrastructure between earth and mars as part of the initial project or just the transport system
spacex,not_removed,its spaceship design question iii the amazing quick flip maneuver during mars landing requires serious amount of attitude control thrust which probably excludes nitrogen as coldgas thrusters what thrusters will be used instead some sort of scaled up superdracos with no turbopumps working on a methalox basis but still pressurefed from copvs or perhaps more complex engines with small turbopumps so that they can be directly fed from the main propellant tanks edit clarified the question as per urocketboys suggestion below
spacex,not_removed,on behalf of udocisin who cant get to this ama right now how will you combat the effects of micro gravity on the trip what are spacexs plans for initial hab units
spacex,not_removed,something that has worried many people is that you dont seem very concerned about solving the problem of getting people to mars or back alivehealthy do you really have no plans to take into account the health affects of microgravity and cosmic radiation or to put it another way do you expect iss or others to have solved these problems before also for the first manned mission to mars why not name the ship after a fictional first manship to mars spacex getting there first is only finitely improbable
spacex,not_removed,raptor thrust scaleup question the raptor prototype congrats to the raptor team has a thrust of tonsforce right now and will be scaled up to tonsforce will the raptor scaleup be a gradual series of smaller steps like optimizations or will it be mostly a single large jump
spacex,not_removed,hi elon the its presentation was astounding but one thing that i questioned was the crane im assuming that this crane is not realistic in terms of the actual ground support system that will be in place and im hoping that you could fill us in on the plans for the gse on especially with respect to accommodating falcon heavy launches at the same time thanks much and all the best
spacex,not_removed,you mentioned high thrust to weight ratio of raptor what is the goal on that front will it be higher than the lbf merlin version will raptor be tested as an upper stage engine on for example falcon heavy and if so what is roughly the timeline on that could you please go into the detail on how it is possible to use raptors on its spacecraft for les of the engines are vaccum versions so they will be useless to use in escape scenario at sea level then unlike superdracos raptors surely have much larger throttle up time
spacex,not_removed,hi elon i know you are mainly concerned about getting humans to mars from an engineering angle but have you thought about we can maintain civilization on mars from a sociologicalpolitical angle you got the first spaceship to mars but now what who runs the colonies are they under the jurisdiction of any earth countries who keeps the peace who magistrates the laws these will all be important when the first spaceship lands and how will you solve them
spacex,not_removed,raptor what specifically is the scaled raptor currently in testing is that purely a prototype or is that also the engine for the air force contract how complete is it relative to expected flight hardware is a raptor upper stage for falcon currently in active development or only the contracted engine if so specs the other transaction agreement with the air force implements section of the ndaa part e of which mandates that the engine be made available to all american launch providers have any other companiesagencies expressed interest in buying raptor
spacex,not_removed,will spacex provide a regular service to kick standardized pallets out of the its unpressurized cargo hold while in leo or after the earth departure burn the palletized cargo will make its own way in leo to the mars surface mars orbit or slingshot elsewhere
spacex,not_removed,hi elon in my astrophysics course we are discussing how any interplanetary manned mission without a huge radiation shield even during solar minimum would result in radiation sickness for a martian mission and death for a mission to any of the gas giants how do you plan on combatting this issue
spacex,not_removed,hello mr musk two years ago during buzz aldrins reddit ama what advice he would give you to achieve the ultimate objective of permanence on mars he replied that the establishment of a permanent colony on mars the next monumental achievement by humanity should not be one private company at all it should be a collection of the best from all the countries on earth how would you reply to buzz aldrin
spacex,not_removed,good afternoon the colonization of mars assumes that humans are able to develop fetus to childbearing in roughy a third of earths gravity what makes you confident that this is a solved problem even if the second generation is okay on mars what about the fourth and so on thank you
spacex,not_removed,i know im stealing this from someone else but is there any chance of a standard shipping container for marsearth transfer items
spacex,not_removed,hello elon what sort of progress has spacex made on dragonfly testing when can we expect to see a dragon landing propulsively
spacex,not_removed,falcon dragon in recent comments the falcon reusability was mentioned at cycles while in the past youve mentioned that some parts would last or more times have you downgraded those figures or are you just not comfortable trying more than until further testing since nasa does not want you to attempt propulsive landings for dragon during their first missions when will you have an opportunity to attempt the first propulsive landing with dragon have you solidified any plans for red dragons payloads what sorts of experiments do you hope to carry out besides edl how long will red dragon remain active on mars
spacex,not_removed,its tanker smart interplanetary launch question the unique its tanker concept potentially allows clever interplanetary launches from leo a fueled tanker could launch at the same time as a fueled spaceship and the tanker could dock with and refill the outbound ship while on outbound escape trajectory the tanker could then brake and return to earth before it escapes earths soi that extra propellant could be used to increase cargo mass to mars or it could be used to reduce mars mission duration it could also be used to enable the its spaceship to return from solar system exploration missions is this possible with the current design or would it require new its capabilities
spacex,not_removed,would you be open to someone else developing a second stage to the bfr to launch science missions like a supersized james webb space telescope have you found any landing sites on mars that will meet your requirements for a relaunch is the primary purpose of spacexs expansion into satellites to provide mars with gps and communication
spacex,not_removed,atmospheric entry will subject the its upper stage to ventral gloads then the landing burn will subject the its capsule to axial gloads how will the its crew seats protect passengers from acceleration that comes from two directions
spacex,not_removed,do you foresee the use of electric propulsion in addition to chemical propulsion to achieve the earthmars transit time you suggested in the iac talk or would this possible to achieve with purely chemical propulsion thank you for your time
spacex,not_removed,hi elon thanks for doing your ama on this subreddit it means a lot to us ive got a few questions will there be a commercial cargo variant of the its for satellites etc along with that will raptors be adapted to falcon upper stages or even an entirely new raptorbased rocket family when will we get to see spacesuits what have been some of the most difficultinteresting technical challenges that spacex has encountered when designing and building the falcon heavy
spacex,not_removed,on the its will you use radiation hardened electronics for deep space or will you continue using redundant electronic systems to vote for redundancy
spacex,not_removed,hi elon got a simple question when are we going to see the new spacesuits a lot of people are pumped to see them keep up the good work
spacex,not_removed,do you have a response to any of the issuescomments about its by robert zubrin for those who havent seen this httpwwwthenewatlantiscompublicationscolonizingmars
spacex,not_removed,aside from joining spacex what can we do to directly help you achieve your mars objectives
spacex,not_removed,what are some of the craziest ideas spacex has considered but not kept in the early stages of development of the its
spacex,not_removed,hi elon which challenges in the field of computer science and robotics are most important to deal with for the colonization of mars and the future of space exploration
spacex,not_removed,hi elon how does the landing leg mechanism on the its work its markedly different to the legs on a falcon
spacex,not_removed,what are your plans to protect astronauts from radiation also are there developments with regards to reuse airorganic waste and water
spacex,not_removed,has any research been put into deciding the landing site of the first mars colony any personal preferences for the first words on mars
spacex,not_removed,mr musk what details can you talk about regarding the cfdanalysis that is being donewill be done for the supersonic retropropulsion while pitching for mars edl i personally use cfd for my research and would like to end up at spacex someday
spacex,not_removed,hello mr musk how many engineers doctors journalists astronauts etc wil be on the first colonisation flight do spacex plan to devise a standarized space storage system how many of these specalized flights would occur before it is opened up to the public thanks for answering to our questions
spacex,not_removed,hi elon at what stagepopulation of the mars colony do you anticipate a satellite constellation for gps and internet services would make sense to be introduced any early plans at spacex to place any kind of service satellites in mars orbit to supplement the colony
spacex,not_removed,are there any plans to investigate switching from belltype closedcycle engines to aerospiketype technology you started out out with opencycle engines now youre playing with closedcycle engines the next step seems to be trying aerospike tech especially now that materials science makes that technology viable the aerospike design is an altitude compensating nozzle that maintains efficiency in variable atmospheric pressures like earth then mars seems like a winwin httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaerospikeengine
spacex,not_removed,what is the reasoning behind having the sort of radial solar array layout on the its as opposed to the more traditional accordionstyle design on dragon
spacex,not_removed,can you tell us a little bit more about the falcon fairing reuse process what stage is that project in right now
spacex,not_removed,hi elon mars is a very dusty planet what types of mechanisms are in place to ensure electronics and the enginers arent damaged by dust build up
spacex,not_removed,have you considered the formation of a mars development corporation to help fund the rd for its i am sure that a few million shareholders with no real expectation of shirt term return could come up with billion or so better than stealing underpants anyway
spacex,not_removed,hi elon will the people onboard its wear the same type of spacesuits as those being developed for crewed dragon anything more you can share about those suits at this time also are there any areas of textile innovation that need to happen to improve spacesuits further thanks
spacex,not_removed,hey elon massive spacex fan thanks for doing this today my question is can you provide any updates information really anything on the launch site in boca chica
spacex,not_removed,its spaceship testing question according to your slides an empty its spaceship will have a δv budget of over kms ie it could probably reach orbit and also come back and land on earth if it does not have the full dry mass of the final spaceship and has slightly shorter raptorvac nozzles do you plan to use clever suborbital hops like grasshopper to develop the its spaceship gradually with potentially reaching orbit at the end of the test series
spacex,not_removed,hi there elon any plans for an isru test on the up and coming red dragon mission
spacex,not_removed,hey elon im the mech lead of a mars rover design team at my university we compete in the urc in utah and im wondering will spacex ever consider developing a marslunar rover it would be totally wicked thanks
spacex,not_removed,mr musk first off youre just an awesome human being and one of the few people in such an influential position that actually give me some hope for our species so thanks for everything youve done and no doubt will continue to do i have a couple questions do you think mars colonization will help us begin to live more sustainably back here on earth the moon landing gave rise to the epa and environmental movement but today we are so flooded by pictures from the iss and from other worlds that im fearful the overall population is so desensitized to it all it may not make a difference in their general mindset which leads me to do you think its dangerous to begin spreading our species into the stars with the current pervasive consumerburnstuffforpower mindset do you have plans to keep anything that contacts the martian atmosphere sterile in the off chance there is life we have yet to discover whats your favorite flavor of ice cream
spacex,not_removed,its probably an internet chestnut by now but ive heard spacexs approach to engineering described as fail faster and learn more what techniques and methods have helped you maximize the benefit of failures do you feel that these techniques are working better than traditional aerospace systems assurance and why
spacex,not_removed,greetings from the space coast would you be willing to provide an update on the investigation of the september event and falcon s return to flight subsequent reports indicate the event was related to the second stage lox tank is a redesign of the lox tanks under consideration eg switching from monocoque to semimonocoque design andor using a different aluminum alloy to increase strength externalization of the helium pressurization tank
spacex,not_removed,hi elon two questions will the falcon ever fly without landing legs and instead land back on the stand like the bfr booster what is the status of the internet satellite constellation
spacex,not_removed,when can we expect any preliminary images or specifications on the mars space suits
spacex,not_removed,mr musk the destruction of the schiapparelli lander on mars was a somber reminder of the difficulties involved in interplanetary travel how many successful unmanned missions to mars will need to occur before you are convinced it is safe for a manned mission and what is spacex doing to prepare for launching missions into the unknown from a systems and mission control standpoint
spacex,not_removed,elon thank you for taking time out for this ama two questions the finiancial investment for the its program has been estimated at httpwwwthenewatlantiscompublicationscolonizingmars larger than every space program budget in the world with the only exception being nasa how will spacex overcome this first and possibly most daunting hurdle is there potential for automation to lower fabrication and assembly coststimes for the falcon program what kinds of automation technologies have you transferred from your venture in the automotive industry into the space industry
spacex,not_removed,hi elon how do you plan to transfer such large amounts of cryogenic propellant between spacecraft in low earth orbit will the tank design utilize capillary forces to control the location of the fluid what about boiloff i work on research experiments that are investigating these issues and it would be cool if spacex can use our research to inform their design thanks for everything you do youre pretty neat need any help
spacex,not_removed,how will the spacecraft help its passengers handle multiple different directional loads from launch and reentry
spacex,not_removed,good afternoon elon im curious how much consideration has been placed toward the social side of the colonization of mars im thinking economic policies regarding jobs and income law and enforcement family structures essentially the daytoday lifestyles of our future interplanetary pioneers will these things be accounted for when building our brave new world or will they be expected to develop organically and on a side note thank you for being who you are
spacex,not_removed,hi elon whats the latest on the space suits what tech specs can you tell us regarding them
spacex,not_removed,q during refueling in zerog how will you pump the fuels from one tank to another q you have said that the upper stage will act as its own launch escape system how will you fire the engines quickly enough to get away from an explosion q how will the crew survive a catastrophic failure of the upper stage
spacex,not_removed,if it were cheap enough would you consider purchasing propellants in space from other organizations such as lunar or neoderived lox
spacex,not_removed,hello mr musk have you considered bulk material and printing as an option for getting simple supplies to mars vs premadeflatpack equipment items like plates and silverware cups even chairs tables basic living building and working supplies also if so have you considered converting plant material or other into a printable plastic thus cutting down on future cargo needs user utroyunrau mentioned when i asked this in the past that you could use the sebatier reaction in the presence of nickel you get methane a similar reaction co in the presence of iron produces ethylene so you can make this from atmospheric gasses polyethylene is printable thank you for your time amongst what has to be the busiest schedule
spacex,not_removed,how does the raptor engine prevent the methane rich preburner from generating soot which would clog the injectors
spacex,not_removed,hi elon former pretoria boys high survivor now living on west coast usa can falcon cores be reused on a falcon heavy are you actually attempting to blow up a real copv to prove your theory is rtf strictly subject to reproducing the problem ie are you grounded indefinitely unless you can reproduce the problem
spacex,not_removed,since will need to be repaired will it also be upgraded to support fh or even bfrthe its booster edit removed question nr
spacex,not_removed,in your its presentation you showed launching the ship with the crew first then launching the tanker many wonder if it would not be more efficient to launch the tankers first and potentially even have multiple in orbit at the same time sort of as an interplanetary pitstop slight goosebumps just typing that out my question therefore is was this merely for the sake of the presentation as the exact plans are not yet finished and thus irrelevant which order it is on the presentation or is it an actual strategic choice spacex has made and what are then the benefits to launching the ship before the tanker
spacex,not_removed,how critical are red dragon edl data for the its design and how would a slip to impact the its timeline
spacex,not_removed,in iac you talked only about the its how is the red dragon missions plans going how do you plan to use them are there business partners interested on sending stuff to mars or are you going to use it to test technology and help land people on the planet with the bfrits
spacex,not_removed,hey elon can you provide any information on living spaces inside the its
spacex,not_removed,hi elon early permits for dragonfly testing at mcgregor outline four maneuvers for testing propulsive assist full propulsive landing propulsive assist hopping and full propulsive hopping how many of those maneuvers have been completed and are we going to see any video of them in the next months
spacex,not_removed,what dragon propulsive landing tests need to be completed before the first red dragon mission any update on the dragonfly testing program
spacex,not_removed,for thrust vector control in the raptor engines will methane be used as a working fluid for hydraulics similar to with merlin or will some method other than hydraulics be used
spacex,not_removed,welp minutes of answers is not bad how many other billionaires do you know would let you ask questions for minutes
spacex,not_removed,will the its need any sort of crew if so what will be its size and responsibilities
spacex,not_removed,hello elon regarding longerterm provisions foodstuffs and rationing have hydroponic systems or more generally plant growth been considered for implementation anywhere in the its how has the its been designed in terms of mental health and overall psychological wellbeing what positions or activities do passengers have to fulfill these needs during flight
spacex,not_removed,elon in addition to economic infrastructure it seems like social infrastructure might become rapidly important in a martian colony what are you thoughts on how conflict resolution and emergency services might be handled on a new colony and on a related note do you think there is a possibility of the creation of a sovereign nation on mars with its own system of government or do you think it will be just another theatre for the politics of earth
spacex,not_removed,hi elon big fan im wondering if you and the team at space x have thought anything about the moral dilemma of a colony on mars if we find microbial life there carl sagan argued that if there was life even just microbes mars belongs to the them whats your reasoning on the matter
spacex,not_removed,what can an average person do help advance the goal of becoming an interplanetary species
spacex,not_removed,hello mr musk will the initial unmanned test landings on the martian surface include any cargoequipment intended for use by the first manned landings and can you provide any thoughts on what would be included electric vehicles fuel processors water stores etc thank you for answering all our questions
spacex,not_removed,is or will spacex be looking into their own ideas for the actual colonisation side of things habitats shelters etc or will that be something you guys leave to others at least for the moment and you mentioned how youd like the first ship there to be named heart of gold related to that do you have any favourite names for the first colony thank you for your time
spacex,not_removed,are you concerned about the possibility that the first mars colonies will be under heavy influence of a very small number of countries and companies and therefore creating a monopoly over the economy and culture of the first mars civilizations
spacex,not_removed,hey mr musk ive heard a lot about how carbon fiber is generally not ideal for space flight due to its tendency to offgas and become warped if youre able to without sharing trade secrets would you mind explaining some of the methods used to make the carbon space proof thanks so much for all that you are doing for space flight and humanity as a whole
spacex,not_removed,hey elon in the past youve mentioned that one of the major issues with space travel is the amount of fuel required anyway do you think spacex will pursue alternative technology in the future like nuclear thermal propulsion
spacex,not_removed,elon during your announcement of the mars architecture you cited several aspects where there is already a precedence where its a matter of scaling an existing capability what firstofitskind capabilities are part of the plan that spacex will need to face things that come to mind are orbital refueling and synchronization between ships en route to avoid collisions what other groundbreaking is ahead
spacex,not_removed,do you plan on the falcon heavy launches to be automated much like the interplanetary transport system sending payloads to leo or mars in rapid succession
spacex,not_removed,hello elon my first question is will spacex make local transportation for the martian surface rovers and the like or is that more up teslas alley
spacex,not_removed,you mentioned try to double the number of flights with each earthmars orbital rendezvous which is every months until the city can grow by itself how important is a sustainable mining operation to self contained growth
spacex,not_removed,hi elon during the presentation you showcased the booster landing back on the launch mount could you elaborate on the landing location accuracy youre aiming for in order for this to happen
spacex,not_removed,hi elon as i understand orbital mechanics it would seem to be more efficient to build infrastructure on the moon and use earth to gravity assist our way to mars is this true if so are you focusing on direct flights to mars because you want to expedite the process
spacex,not_removed,marsearth latency is to minutes with whom is spacex working to build datacommunications services that work at distance through radiationdust interference and around objects that block lineofsight
spacex,not_removed,hello elon thanks a lot for doing this awesome ama and in the best place possible our beloved rspacex subreddit regarding the its vehicle escape launch system does it really consists on the spacecraft separating from the booster previously than expected with full engine power on the spacecraft while the engines halt on the booster in this scenario would the spacecraft be capable of landing back even if at that point its over the ocean or would it always try to to reach a parking orbit if possible also would this mean that there is no els when coming back from mars or other celestial bodies regarding the its booster launching and landing point the own launching pad isnt it excessively dangerous to land on the same launching pad couldnt this cause severe issues if a booster crashes on the pad when landing blocking any launch for weeksmonths thanks a lot
spacex,not_removed,hi elon im designing furniture and living space for mars for my degree how do you foresee the living space of your spacecraft for the mars mission what aspects of the daily life will be prioritised in this environment
spacex,not_removed,what role do you see falcon heavy having in spacexs lineup once the its is operational and flying regularly
spacex,not_removed,how can astronauts protect themselves from the perchlorate in the soil on mars in the long term how can we sustain life on mars if the amount of radiation on mars cant be controlled for
spacex,not_removed,i am interested in the types of habitats the first colonists will be using several proposals have come up glass domes lava tubes igloos and even using the first its itself as the first hab do you have a favorite or is it better to try all of the above edit appears he
spacex,not_removed,solarcity is being brought into the fold is their experience building solar systems going to be utilised in your mars power grid plans
spacex,not_removed,we have all seen the awesome service tower in the its animation but i think we can agree that is not a final design could you elaborate on what you have in mind for the final construction mobile launchlanding pad or vab reuse of current tower still compatible with thanks very much
spacex,not_removed,hello mr musk just a little question about financement how are you and your team planning to fund the program must be one hell of a big investment thanks for sharing this moment with us from france
spacex,not_removed,what would the spacex crew on the mars ship look like would there be a captain an engineer etc
spacex,not_removed,early mars missions how do you plan to combat the low gravity on mars for long duration stays how will humans safely return to earth after years in what will be your primary objectives for the first unmanned and manned mission how will early crews be selected and trained what will nasas role be if any in providing or training astronauts
spacex,not_removed,first off thank you so much for taking time off of your busy schedule to do this ama question in case of a rud of the its booster during landing at what may be the contingency plans put in place for this scenario question why launch crew first but not fuel
spacex,not_removed,will spacex collaborate or partner with universities or colleges as part of the its project or will it be contained within the company
spacex,not_removed,hey elon has your team at spacex proposed any landing sites for the first mars colony what sort of things factor into such a decision
spacex,not_removed,will the first its carry the factory that is needed to refuel itself and bring cargo or will that be for the red dragon missions any investors come out to support the its
spacex,not_removed,hi elon thanks for doing the ama how do you plan on handling the contamination issue relative to mars if there is small microscopic life on mars how will we know it is not from humans and authentic to mars
spacex,not_removed,hi elon how will you chose people to go to mars will you just send anyone that wants to go or will you choose based on specific set of skills
spacex,not_removed,what do you envision as the ideal combination of career fieldsspecialized jobs for the first mars missions how many people will be sent on the first mars missions
spacex,not_removed,hey elon once you guys get to mars youre gonna be in need of some serious manufacturing equipment on the planet in order to make it self sustaining do you guys have plans to transfer cnc machines to mars the raw materials are also very expensive and capital intensive to produce what do you see yourself doing there do you plan on sticking with one metal group say aluminum alloys for the initial colonization phase i know everyone raves about additive manufacturing but i dont think an industrial base on mars can survive on just additive especially when you consider the porous nature of most additive parts and the lack of atmosphere on mars also how hands on are you in regards to the manufacturing at spacex and tesla
spacex,not_removed,q on the journey back to earth is the spaceship expected to be stripped down to a return mode so that much less mass is on board and less methalox will be required thank you
spacex,not_removed,what are your thoughts on the problems associated with the lower gravity astronauts will experience while their on mars how could children be born and develop healthfully in of terrestial gravity i am specifically referring to when they are on the surface not the flight over thank you so much for doing this ama
spacex,not_removed,do you plan to use its for launching commercial payloads into earth orbit are you considering any other mission types like iss servicing hubble servicing space junk deorbiting does it make economic sense to use its instead of the falcon for earth orbit
spacex,not_removed,regarding isru will propellant be produced on mars prior to the first human its mission and if so how
spacex,not_removed,its booster launch how realistic is the crane depicted in your animated video what will pad really look like for the first launches if the its booster can reach leo as a single stage will you consider placing one in orbit to use as a fuel depot youve expressed your desire to name the first manned its heart of gold was it purely an engineering decision to go with engines or did hitch hikers guide inspire you to push for that number out of several possibilities
spacex,not_removed,following the mars colonization efforts in what ways would you expect space exploration to change how long do you think it would take for those changes to occur thank you
spacex,not_removed,hi elon what assumptionsprovisions have been made for nonspacex equipment that either interfaces with the its or makes use of its systems im thinking of large structures or life support equipment for colonists use on mars that may make use of its components or structure to save weight as these may affect the design of spacexs systems cheers
spacex,not_removed,what do you think the first factory on mars will produce related query you mentioned nuclear as a power source would it be possible to construct a reactor with materials on mars
spacex,not_removed,how close can the standby tanker be to the booster without taking damage from the sound of the engines
spacex,not_removed,regarding its going to other locations such as the moon youve mentioned that its could visit practically anywhere in the solar system but without isru for propellant production or in the case of the moon for example no atmospheric deceleration to cut down ∆v requirements for landing would the ship be capable of the return journey also could agencies such as nasa or potential other customers put payloads on the early unmanned its flights and of course thanks for all yourspacexs hard work and for doing this ama
spacex,not_removed,a couple of technical questions for you what do you use for requirements verification validation traditional review methods formal methods or a blend can you go into detail what level of documentation do you produce for each system are you required to conform to and design assurance and safety standards and a slightly more cheerful one what is the most amusing anecdote you have from your time at spacex
spacex,not_removed,will you be sending robots to build the habitats
spacex,not_removed,hello mr musk first off allow me to say thank you for taking the time to answer our questions reddit and especially this subreddit is filled with people who are very passionate about science space and the furthering the human race so we really appreciate this my question is a tad controversial but so is every aspect of attempting a colonization of another planet obviously humans are sexual creatures and a species which relies on many different urges my question is when planning to send people per trip as well as establishing a colony millions of miles away how do you and your team plan to approach this fundamental trait of humanity for instance if someone were to become pregnant either on board during the travel or even after the travel will this be a circumstance that will be planned for and therefore have a certain procedure to follow of course very minimal if any that im aware of research has taken place about conception and pregnancies outside of earth however things happen is this something you have taken into account among that humans are prone to many vices i assume all of the applicants will be vetted of course but some vices seem to be engrained in our way of life such as alcohol what aspects of this topic have you and the spacex team considered thank you
spacex,not_removed,hey elon thanks for doing this ama as the technology for rockets get more sophisticated i wondered if the same attention is given to how the living environment will be in the its spacecraft for human beings its said that the spacecraft is designed with comfort in mind for the passengers do you imagine it being like the inside of super fancy and high tech airplane
spacex,not_removed,what was the reasoning for trying to use or so engines vs a smaller number of large engines redundancy and international vehicle compatibility perhaps
spacex,not_removed,while youve mentioned repeatedly the interest in terraforming and space colonization of other planets i was curious does space x care aboutacknowledge the interest in the concept of synthetic space colonies thinking of its utility in a sort of median capacity such as setting up space gas stations or the equivalent of selfsufficient biodomes and such i suppose im curious if thats out of technological capacity or if terraforming is the cheaper easier alternative
spacex,not_removed,how are dragon tests proceeding any untethered tests yet what landing modes will flight dragon use and whats the plan for progressing to propulsive land landing do you have any landing sites in mind or in progress for dragon
spacex,not_removed,will any roboticautomated technology be used to build anything on mars ahead of the human crew
spacex,not_removed,on the initial missions will the astronauts just stay in the its also if there is no seperate base how long can the its stay on mars for
spacex,not_removed,will spacex build vehicles for crew to use on mars how will they roam the planet thanks love your work
spacex,not_removed,how do you see competition from other companies factoring into the economy of space journeying in the coming decades
spacex,not_removed,hi did spacex received any positive support technical or financial for mars colonization from other countriescompanies since the iac presentation thanks
spacex,not_removed,hi elon as a corollary to the question about what spacex technologymaterial development is still needed what do you see as the largest gaps in engineering knowledge base needed to bridge the space between what we have and what we need to accomplish in other words for those of us that want to help make itsmars colonization a reality what do we need to do to be as useful as possible
spacex,not_removed,what types of aborts will the its be able to execute will there be any dead zones during the process of mars transfer where no abort may be attempted
spacex,not_removed,mr musk what are your views on the game kerbal space program and do you believe games such as this are a good way to give todays youth a chance to explore the idea of space exploration at a much earlier age
spacex,not_removed,hi elon how is spacex going to test the bfs carbon shell are you guys going to leave one in space for say months and then bring it down for inspection thank you for doing the ama
spacex,not_removed,hey elon will spacex design the its to be reconfigurable so it can be used for other missions while waiting for the next transit window like say swapping out the habitat for a more traditional stage payload launcher
spacex,not_removed,earths atmospheric levels are now at or above ppm as sea levels rise how will spacex protect its infrastructure situated on the coasts
spacex,not_removed,while not asking for specific names or contact information has spacex been approached for consideration of using the its architecture and lift capacity for any projects besides colonizing mars since the iac talk and do you anticipate that there will be any other revenue streams for its use beyond just the colonization process of mars
spacex,not_removed,you are the first person ever to present a credible pathway to mars obviously this particular pathway will require the resources and cooperation of many others in addition to those of spacex your projections seem to assume that such additional partners will become available fairly early on might you have any other estimates based on an assumption that such future venture partners might be somewhat delayed in coming onboard with the project
spacex,not_removed,have you considered how will internet will be rebuilt there have you already considered any standard i would avoid the actual one see pjon
spacex,not_removed,hello i am currently a planning and sustainability major at geography major at gvsu it has long been a dream of mine to be part of the first master plan for a human settlement on the mooncelestial body other then earth do you have any plans on adding planning or social organizers to your systemhave them already would you consider it a fruitless dream to become apart of the team going to the heavens with such skills
spacex,not_removed,wouldnt we be better off using stable solid oxygen and a laser to excite the crystals into a seperated atomic state as propellant
spacex,not_removed,were lucky elon musk isnt evil
spacex,not_removed,i dont think it was a joke because spacex also mentioned about the kickstarter campaign on twitter why do you think it was a joke why do you think it is unreliable thanks i edited the text because i had a mistake
spacex,not_removed,have you thought about building a larger spaceship in earth orbit could we use your current rockets to start building now so when you send people to mars the can take a much larger payload to help with construction
spacex,not_removed,just wondering whens the next ama
spacex,not_removed,hi elon is spacex open to a joint mission with nasaesaetc to colonize mars will you send the its for the first manned mission
spacex,not_removed,hey elon what are the details on how bfr will return the tankers booster to the launch clamp is it a simple process or is it like a catching device that can move around to orient with the rocket thanks for taking the time to do this ama
spacex,not_removed,hi elon since the core is now incompatible with the ground support equipment with ft upgrades what is the plan for the inflight abort test use a flown booster with some engines removed
spacex,not_removed,hi elon i was wondering if you were aware of dr robert zubrins idea regarding your its methodology in essence split the current stage in half right before earth escape so that the bottom half of the interplanetary spaceship circles around and lands on earth to begin immediate refitting and the top half is a smaller vessel that is sent towards mars that is to say you could use your big earth escape launch system five times every launch window instead of once every launch window and increasing your delivery capacity by a factor of have you considered this
spacex,not_removed,hey chris im a little disappointed elon didnt get around to answering your question but id love to hear your thoughts on the matter if youve got time youre one of my personal heroes thanks for all your hard work
spacex,not_removed,hi colonel also a huge fan and fellow countryman thank you for your dedication and awesomeness in all your years of service i too would like to hear your thoughts on your questions especially about the colonization of antarctica ive always been extremely interested in participating in such an endeavour and im wondering what sort of place someone like me without specialization or profession thats applicable but with much enthusiasm energy and adaptability would potentially have in other words if you colonize it can i come and shovel snow for you
spacex,not_removed,we are still far from figuring this out in detail but the current plan is send dragon scouting missions initially just to make sure we know how to land without adding a crater and then to figure out the best way to get water for the sabatier reaction heart of gold spaceship flies to mars loaded only with equipment to build the propellant plant first crewed mission with equipment to build rudimentary base and complete the propellant plant try to double the number of flights with each earthmars orbital rendezvous which is every months until the city can grow by itself
spacex,not_removed,as a followup considering the synodal reuse of the its spaceships what form of permanent habitation do you foresee shipped modules or an eventual shift to insitu resource utilization such as martian rigolithplasticreinforced concrete structures thank you for your time
spacex,not_removed,it had to be for important scientific and fictional reasons the dense packing is just to max out thrust to weight but it would be cool if there was a virtual nozzle side effect
spacex,not_removed,and does the ocotweb placement on falcon have a smaller yet similar effect on the inner engine
spacex,not_removed,the big booster will have an easier time of things than falcon as the mass ratio of the stages is lower and it will have lower density net result is that it wont come in quite as hot and fast as falcon so falcon should be a bounding case on the big booster final falcon has a lot of minor refinements that collectively are important but uprated thrust and improved legs are the most significant actually i think the boosters could be used almost indefinitely so long as there is scheduled maintenance and careful inspections falcon block the final version in the series is the one that has the most performance and is designed for easy reuse so it just makes sense to focus on that long term and retire the earlier versions block starts production in about months and initial flight is in to months so there isnt much point in ground testing block or much beyond a few reflights
spacex,not_removed,it used to be developing a new metal alloy that is extremely resistant to oxidation for the hot oxygenrich turbopump which is operating at insane pressure to feed a bar main chamber anything that can burn will burn we seem to have that under control as the raptor turbopump didnt show erosion in the test firings but there is still room for optimization biggest question right now is sealing the carbon fiber tanks against cryo propellant with hot autogenous pressurization the oxygen tank also has an oxidation risk problem as it is pressurized with pure hot oxygen will almost certainly need to apply an inert layer of some kind hopefully something that can be sprayed if need be will use thin sheets of invar welded together on the inside
spacex,not_removed,in addition what technology if any do you think you have nailed downmastered at this point
spacex,not_removed,yeah for those that know their stuff that was really the big news the flight tank will actually be slightly longer than the development tank shown but the same diameter that was built with latest and greatest carbon fiber prepreg in theory it should hold cryogenic propellant without leaking and without a sealing linker early tests are promising will take it up to of burst pressure on an ocean barge in the coming weeks
spacex,not_removed,those are the header tanks that contain the landing propellant they are separate in order to have greater insulation and minimize boiloff avoid sloshing on entry and not have to press up the whole main tank
spacex,not_removed,also why does the booster only have one in tank
spacex,not_removed,i think we need a new name its just isnt working im using bfr and bfs for the rocket and spaceship which is fine internally but will aim to release details of the habitation section when we have actual live mockups maybe in a year or two
spacex,not_removed,as an addon how differently will the its be configured internally for a smaller crew such as the first one vs a full crew
spacex,not_removed,also how much personal cargo will each passenger be able to bring will basic necessities be standardized by spacex or will each have to bring their own toiletries clothes etc
spacex,not_removed,yes
spacex,not_removed,ive thought this could be a way to get animals to mars you could send baby fish for aquaponics on a low mass quick flight in order to get them into bigger tanks before they grow too big and requiring their transfer tank to be more complex land animals could be sent this way too they could potentially make the shorter flight in a medically induced coma with a few people to look over them
spacex,not_removed,approx sec vacuum isp and metric tons of thrust a high acceleration landing is a lot more efficient so there wouldnt be any hovering unless it encountered a problem or unexpected wind conditions a rocket that lands slowly is wasting a lot of fuel aiming for gs
spacex,not_removed,if i recall correctly on one of the slides it mentioned that there it will be gs upon reentry it does not specify however whether that will be during the landing burn or aerobreaking it would be nice if that is clarified as well
spacex,not_removed,good question that wasnt shown at iac the spaceship and tanker would have split body flaps for pitch and roll probably just use the attitude control thrusters for yaw
spacex,not_removed,from one of his replies we are still far from figuring this out in detail but the current plan is send dragon scouting missions initially just to make sure we know how to land without adding a crater and then to figure out the best way to get water for the sabatier reaction
spacex,not_removed,dude really youre just straight up stealing my job
spacex,not_removed,didnt know how much i needed this thanks
spacex,not_removed,fucking flawless performance
spacex,not_removed,pretty sure the f in bfr and bfs stands for fucking and not falcon see here
spacex,not_removed,to this point what technology does spacex plan leverage to eliminate or minimize the damaging effects of cosmic radiation on humans
spacex,not_removed,hi medhockey i noticed that your second question is very similar to the one from iac press qa transcript question no hope this will help d
spacex,not_removed,followup do you have a plan on how to turn mars into an earthlike planet any plan on how to warm up mars will spacex work on that
spacex,not_removed,i have a small story that answers your question my dad was a nasa engineer we had a discussion about why nasa budget kept getting cut more and more causing many people to be laid off i ended up asking something like what is the purpose in space exploration that others dont see he told me that it was the environment that gathers many intelligent people who wish to explore space and create many new inventions to advance humanity i found it unfortunate that such things could not be sold for a profit to help fund space exploration even further its difficult to tell if people realize this but the almost accidental discoveries people have while searching for solutions to the impossible are very valuable things more valuable than pure gold
spacex,not_removed,ive heard it said that the profit could be in acting as a sort of hub for space flight to other parts of the solar system lower gravity and thinner atmosphere mean launches are cheaper so if you mine and build rockets on mars thatd going to make space flight much more economical
spacex,not_removed,i dont know much about the geology of mars but wouldnt mining be a big deal
spacex,not_removed,i think this comment by umredding fits well with the question some facts about mars it has hour days trillion square meters of land area roughly equivalent to the land area of earth and an average temperature of thats cold but better than any of our other options first a self sustaining martian colony is a plan b for earth should a catastrophe occur that wipes out humanity second rare and valuable metals are abundant on mars and deuterium is more abundant the fuel of choice should we ever achieve nuclear fusion as a power source there is commercial and economic motivations to mine and manufacture on mars because gravity is less than on earth escape velocity is thusly lower and exporting of world to earth is cheaper than going from earth to mars third there is substantial opportunity for scientific research on mars looking for martian life and furthering our understanding of the creation of our solar system there is also materials science and pharmaceutical chemistry that is achievable on mars due to the lower gravity than here on earth for example did you know you can make aluminum more transparent than your typical silicon glass the problem is gravitational shear as the metal cools there are methods to get around this but its extremely expensive reserved for high end optics and bulletproof us fighter jet cockpit domes because its a government contract so fuck it but in space or on mars if the gravity is low enough they can mass produce aluminum glass never again will you shatter your phone screen by dropping it or shooting it apparently and one that ties economics and science together is the amount of innovation that has to go into successfully establishing such a colony as neal degrasse tyson said for every dollar invested in nasa there is a economic return just from the innovation that comes out of solving problems pyrex bakeware came out of trying to develop rocket noses was the attempt at making a compound that would displace water thats water displacement attempt the internet as a whole came out of a scientists who wanted a better way of linking scientific papers to the documents they cite in their bibliographies just attempting to get to mars would be a huge economic boom and were seeing this already with the birth of the commercial space flight industry with virgin galactic spacex and boeing specifically boeing working beyond nasa and military contracts finally there are political motivations just look how the us rallied behind the space race of the imagine if you can motivate whole nations or an entire planet behind a similar cause edit to quote tyson again who wants to build a jet engine that is more fuel efficient no one that isnt an aviation executive who wants to go to mars he had more to say in this thread im paraphrasing but basically he was saying frontier science and engineering inspires the next generation and they get involved and end up solving other problems while trying to achieve the goal in front of them
spacex,not_removed,the new raptor specifications demonstrate extremely high temperature and pressure environments for preburners and the combustion chamber thus what is the materials science behind the raptor engine did spacexs propulsion team develop a new alloy to suit the hostile fullflow staged combustion environment my bet is they use the same old inconel but with surface treatment like a silver or gold coating or something
spacex,not_removed,although unspoken it seems almost certain that the first set of flights would be using lower delta v numbers on the lowenergy hohmann transfer firstly you send the chemical factory in which case the fast transit is a complete waste of money then i think the rhetoric was that a small group of astronauts are sent in order to do groundwork with that equipment however you read this that means flying with less than full capacity of people you would also need more equipment per person in early flights so im just making my best educated guess but i would say that the first few missions will have the free return options and subsequent missions will only go if the tech is already sufficiently proven
spacex,not_removed,also what provisions for shedding heat does its have is a lot of heat to radiate the renderings dont appear to show any ammonia radiators
spacex,not_removed,elon musk has already said it will use very powerful methalox rcs thrustersalmost certainly feed from the main tank if the transcipt of the press cconference is correct then it will be tonne thrust thusters
spacex,not_removed,musk already said that the its is supposed to provide an economic forcing function to bring in as many third parties as possible
spacex,not_removed,i mean its nice and all but speaking from the business point isnt the competition and space race actually helping the cause especially if you have one common goal and that is mars the only bad thing i can think of is rushing things too much or running out of money prematurely similar to the moon race with the russian rocket
spacex,not_removed,hope more up vote you as spacex work with an extremely agile approach bet they had some insane ideas along the way
spacex,not_removed,this is my major question how much will be manufactured on planet and how much do they plan to refine local materials for production
spacex,not_removed,couldnt this cause severe issues if a booster crashes on the pad when landing blocking any launch for weeksmonths consider that a returning booster has way less fuel than a launching one they seem to have cleared the barges with failed landing trials pretty fast plus they are unlikely to have more than one booster per launch pad so the loss of the booster itself will be the biggest loss and delay
spacex,not_removed,perchlorates arent really much of a problem theyre water soluble so youd really just need to rinse the soil before use also some soil bacteria can eat perchlorates specifically they can use perchlorate as an oxygen alternative during respiration simply making compost in an anaerobic environment could be all you need to start growing crops
spacex,not_removed,hes stated that anyone who can purchase a ticket will be able to go there will be no selection but it will be open to everyone who would like to move
spacex,not_removed,he has said that eventually anyone who can pay will be able to buy a ticket but in the beginning theres going to be a high demand for engineers scientists and other jobs that are essential to getting the basic infrastructure up and running
spacex,not_removed,none are scheduled although he did mention a few months ago that he might do an ama right before the first reflight of a flow booster which should be early next year
spacex,not_removed,just to make sure we know how to land without adding a crater rip schiaparelli
spacex,not_removed,so the first crew arrives without actually having propellent to return
spacex,not_removed,reading this gives me goosebumps so in awe that this plan is a reality
spacex,not_removed,you said until the city can grow itself does that mean there are already companies intersted in aiding in colonization
spacex,not_removed,initially glass panes with carbon fiber frames to build geodesic domes on the surface plus a lot of minertunneling droids with the latter you can build out a huge amount of pressurized space for industrial operations and leave the glass domes for green living space
spacex,not_removed,i love how much of a nerd with a sense of humor you are youre the hero we all need and deserve
spacex,not_removed,so total output remains at at sl and in vac
spacex,not_removed,falcon block falcon naming scheme everybody
spacex,not_removed,falcon block alright now i know youre taking the piss with the names man falcon retconned to falcon falcon falcon full thrust which then had fuller fullerer and fullerest thrust upgrades iirc and now falcon block do you have something against consistent naming schemes
spacex,not_removed,what would the changes be between the currently flying boosters and block is there a public page about previous falcon booster designs
spacex,not_removed,block so far weve had and falcon thats whats missing or was there a version that never flew
spacex,not_removed,final falcon has a lot of minor refinements that collectively are important but uprated thrust and improved legs are the most significant amazing what changes are done to the legs improved landing shock resistance was a close call or improved aerodynamic behavior
spacex,not_removed,starts production in about months and initial flight is in to months holy smokes thats a pretty impressive time frame
spacex,not_removed,for anyone wondering what invar is invar also known generically as in the us is a nickel–iron alloy notable for its uniquely low coefficient of thermal expansion cte or α the name invar comes from the word invariable referring to its relative lack of expansion or contraction with temperature changes httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinvar
spacex,not_removed,i think i just realized how out of this world pun intended intelligent elon is not only can he run multiple companies at a ceo level he knows this amount of detail
spacex,not_removed,was the raptor a full scale unit identical to one that will fly in the future edit his second paragraph was an editaddition for those of you who were not here as early
spacex,not_removed,not sure that weve really mastered anything yet maybe starting engines
spacex,not_removed,not only does that sound exciting it reminds me of a passage from skunkworks we got dr scott of the bureau of standards cleared to work with us as an adviser the fort robertson complex was located less than a thousand yards from the municipal airports inbound runway and the first time dr scott paid us a visit and saw the three tanks of liquid hydrogen holding hundreds of gallons under storage his knees began to shake my god in heaven he exclaimed youre gonna blow up burbank interesting that your tanks will be on a barge good luck and i hope to help out someday
spacex,not_removed,the flight tank will actually be slightly longer than the development tank shown but the same diameter that explains why those guys on twitter had such a hard time fitting it to the bfs cutaways
spacex,not_removed,how far from burst pressure is the nominal operating pressure
spacex,not_removed,that was built with latest and greatest carbon fiber prepreg in theory it should hold cryogenic propellant without leaking and without a sealing linker early tests are promising does the its carbon fiber laminate sandwich still use aluminum honeycomb as the middle layer similar to the falcon interstage and fairing
spacex,not_removed,are you able to tell us where you guys built that with your own tooling or a third party companys tooling
spacex,not_removed,for those who dont know their stuff why is that big news
spacex,not_removed,those are the header tanks that contain the landing propellant they are separate in order to have greater insulation and minimize boiloff avoid sloshing on entry and not have to press up the whole main tank thanks booster seems to have a landing tank only in the methane tank is that so that the methane tank can extend much lower below the height of the cluster of landing engines edit the landing lox tank is the huge vertical lox transfer pipe itself clever
spacex,not_removed,it appears from the picture that the methane header tank is offcenter is it and if so why edit im especially interested in the one in the bfs
spacex,not_removed,the liquid oxygen transfer tube serves as the header tank for ox
spacex,not_removed,mct could still work for multiplanetary colonial transporter for the boosterrocket family i do kinda like phoenix if you are going for a name like falcon
spacex,not_removed,how are names decided at spacex
spacex,not_removed,big falcon rocket does fit bfr
spacex,not_removed,i still like heart of gold
spacex,not_removed,please continue use of bfr and bfs including publicly unless selling naming rights is necessary
spacex,not_removed,probably just pack the pressurized space with cargo early missions will be heavily weighted towards cargo first crewed mission would have about a dozen people as the goal will be to build out and troubleshoot the propellant plant and mars base alpha power system
spacex,not_removed,you should probably publish how fast you can go to mars with the sls budget
spacex,not_removed,how long would that take it certainly wouldnt be months
spacex,not_removed,you could send baby fish for aquaponics on a low mass quick flight in order to get them into bigger tanks before they grow too big and requiring their transfer tank to be more complex wouldnt a quick breeding robust fish species be a better solution if they are breeding fast enough then theyll spread all available tank space exponentially within a handful of generations
spacex,not_removed,man what a stress on that booster that is from twice the speed of sound to in less than seconds
spacex,not_removed,high acceleration landings are more efficient but in the case of a failed engine startup will there even be time to compensate also if it did encounter a problem and needed to hover would there be enough fuel reserves to do so
spacex,not_removed,the spaceship would be limited to around gs nominal but able to take peak loads to times higher without breaking up booster would be nominal of and maybe to without breaking up
spacex,not_removed,split body flaps might if anyone was curious
spacex,not_removed,a pressurized bfs was shown to dock with a tanker for fuel transfer will multiple pressurized bfss in earth orbit be able to dock together to create large habitats between mars transit opportunities do you foresee any possibility of a third nontanker nonmars variant focusing on that usage in order to provide a new revenue stream specifically massive modular space stations
spacex,not_removed,its the automation revolution looks like you need to retrain for bot maintenance crew
spacex,not_removed,as stated in the sibling comment this was changed at the request of the mods to keep this ama a little more kidfriendly
spacex,not_removed,edited by request of the mods to be pg
spacex,not_removed,point water fuel tanks at sun during interplanetary cruise
spacex,not_removed,just a heads up tagging users on reddit is done by adding u in front of the username like this umedhockey youll even get suggestions for autocompleting the username
spacex,not_removed,smoke and mirrors industrial smog will aid the greenhouse effect orbiting mirrors can bounce sunlight onto a citysized area
spacex,not_removed,better to adapt our bodies imo and on this time scale the tech should be possible and a priority ie climb everest with supplemental oxygen or adapt and do it without better to adapt
spacex,not_removed,this is a good reply and reasonable to suggest but the problem with this kind of answer is that the people paying the money to develop space programs like this generally dont get the money back unless you are talking about humanity as a whole you cant even suggest that the usa has had any sort of reasonable roi on spaceflight so far except as a general inspiration to develop new technologies and certainly other countries have benefited from those developments too in some ways even more so than the usa the apollo program certainly was extremely valuable to the development of many new technologies which are in use today but can the same thing be said about the sls program it is also extremely hard to speculate on what the roi on some nebulous future invention might actually be when at the moment we have no idea what stuff is going to be discovered from a business perspective this kind of speculation isnt going to pay the bills other than a general view to fund long term rd from a few pennies of your overall net profit it would be nice if sec rules encouraged this kind of behavior in businesses as well
spacex,not_removed,itll never be efficient to send commodities back to earth the energy required is enormous far beyond any plausible miningprocessing costs here obviously small samples for scientific research but thats a tiny market the only use for mining on mars is for local use so far the only proposed use is refuelling spacecraft which is a bit circular
spacex,not_removed,not to bring resources back to earth asteroids would be more efficient for that
spacex,not_removed,even assuming from the surface of mars to the earth a really generous rate assuming massive its reuse and extrapolating from some figures given by elon musk at the iac that needs to be some pretty valuable stuff to remotely make any kind of profit i seriously doubt that you are going to make much money from raw materials like steel or aluminum steel to give you a cost figure is currently sold for about per ton while shipping that off of the surface of mars would be around go figure the math for how much you are losing to perform that task refined aluminum is a little better you can get about per ton refined gold cast into assayed and certified ingots go for about million per ton so that might start to be profitable the things that colonists on mars are going to be able to make from local resources in bulk quantities at first will be things like wheat and bamboo while interesting and incredibly useful for colonists expecting a huge increase in population those are hardly good export commodities it is going to be a long time before it is cost effective to ship cut flowers between planets something that actually does happen with intercontinental trade right now
spacex,not_removed,first a self sustaining martian colony is a plan b for earth should a catastrophe occur that wipes out humanity i totally agree that a plan b is a good idea but so is lowering our co₂ output and weve struggled to do that to the extent we have a big part of it is by making low and zerocarbon energy sources economical another part is by making lowercarbon alternative products like teslas desirable in their own right not just for their reduced carbon footprint if were serious about getting a million people to move to mars it needs to make at least something close to economic sense for a million people to move there if those reasons are well give them a subsidy to do so then there need to be politically appealing reasons why the public will choose to fund the subsidies and scientists say it would be good for the species even though theres no obvious signs of a problem has not in general done the trick so far second rare and valuable metals are abundant on mars and deuterium is more abundant the fuel of choice should we ever achieve nuclear fusion as a power source there is commercial and economic motivations to mine and manufacture on mars because gravity is less than on earth escape velocity is thusly lower and exporting of world to earth is cheaper than going from earth to mars another part of this thread quoted elon saying that physical exports are unlikely to be profitable do you disagree with that third there is substantial opportunity for scientific research on mars looking for martian life and furthering our understanding of the creation of our solar system okay but out of a population of a million i cant imagine more than a few hundred or a couple thousand being engaged in pure science pure science is a great reason to send rovers and perhaps temporary expeditions it might even justify permanent research stations like we have in antarctica although supplying them might be impractical it cant justify an entire selfsustaining colony for example did you know you can make aluminum more transparent than your typical silicon glass the problem is gravitational shear as the metal cools this is actually an interesting case in a nowlost version of this post i ran the numbers and if youre talking about alon glass the current earthbound processes appear to cost about per ton meanwhile gorilla glass smartphone screens cost about per ton this isnt quite an applestoapples comparison because its comparing militarygrade alon armored glass with commercial smartphone glass but its the best i can do so if you can mine and refine the base materials manufacture the glass and lift it out of the martian gravity well for less than youve made an improvement on the status quo if you get it into the ballpark of its in the running to replace gorilla glass as a smartphone material assuming you use the same weight of material that is the its presentation quoted per ton for earthtomars im not sure what it would be in the other direction it wouldnt be as much because youre in a much shallower gravity well and the ship is returning anyway but it wouldnt be zero because youd need extra fuel to lift the extra mass if the transportation cost—and the other costs—are low enough and the gains from working in lower gravity are high enough and if the earthbound manufacturing process cant be improved enough to drop the price more than that then it might make sense by the way that ton of alon—if you used the same amount as gorilla glass—would make about smartphone screens youd need to produce and export tons per year to make a screen for every iphone apple sells and one that ties economics and science together is the amount of innovation that has to go into successfully establishing such a colony as neal degrasse tyson said for every dollar invested in nasa there is a economic return just from the innovation that comes out of solving problems and yet this argument hasnt secured a reasonable budget for nasa why would a mars colony be different finally there are political motivations just look how the us rallied behind the space race of the and look at how that motivation fell apart by the national pride the thrill of exploration scientific curiosity the good of the species—these are all good reasons to go but they wont actually motivate people to see an expensive centurylong project through to completion that takes the promise of economic profit and im worried it just may not be there for mars
spacex,not_removed,a good way to get noticed would be to research it and present what you find show some value
spacex,not_removed,elon musk has already said it will use very powerful methalox rcs thrustersalmost certainly feed from the main tank the problem with main tank feed is lack of propellant pressure which can be fixed in two ways by adding a turbopump this increases complexity and mass or by using intermediate copvs the attitude control system can still be kept small compact and robust this is why im curious about more details regarding these thrusters 🙂
spacex,not_removed,what about food contamination through particles or something
spacex,not_removed,eventually
spacex,not_removed,yes what he said at the recent iac was i think probably well name the first ship that goes to mars heart of gold i like the fact that its driven by infinite improbability because i think our ship is also extremely improbable
spacex,not_removed,if only douglas adams couldve lived long enough to see this what a legendary honor
spacex,not_removed,also the main rocket has engines
spacex,not_removed,for those wondering httphitchhikerswikiacomwikiheartofgold
spacex,not_removed,and the first stage has rocket engines
spacex,not_removed,its so going to be nicknamed the hog
spacex,not_removed,they wouldnt need it and it wouldnt be efficient to send gas for home even if there is an emergency that requires them to come home its mars so its simply just life or death
spacex,not_removed,paraphrasing louis ck you look at the pyramids and ask how did they do it well they threw human suffering and death at it until it was done of course it would definitely be better for every life to be saved but they will definitely get a good number of applicants to go to mars even if theyre guaranteed to die there and its obviously cheaper to not need to worry about saving them
spacex,not_removed,first crewed mission with equipment to build rudimentary base and complete the propellant plant sure sounds like it to me seems kinda risky
spacex,not_removed,would the first crew be a full complement of people or a smaller specialized group trained for the initial setup
spacex,not_removed,how far under ground would you estimate to sufficiently hold pressure and be strong enough to not collapse without having to build major tunnel support structures also what major challenges does tunneling in martian rock pose versus earth rock
spacex,not_removed,is spacex actively looking into this technology
spacex,not_removed,that sounds awesome a clear city of glass domes will look amazing
spacex,not_removed,do you plan on having any kind of redundancy or separate domes for example what if some catastrophe causes one dome to be uninhabitable or what if somehow the outer protection gets destroyed
spacex,not_removed,in memory of buckminster bucky fuller geodesic domes and since there will be a lot minertunneling droids can we name these scvs and can we control them remotely from earth and can we have them say scv ready scv good to go sir
spacex,not_removed,having trouble with the geodesic dome idea it is strong against outside loads like we have here on earth with same air pressure inside as outside but with to psi air pressure applied on the inside some form of inverted dome shaped more like a satellite dish makes better sense doesnt it you want the load on the outside of the arc dont you
spacex,not_removed,what kind of glass are you going to use how will you deal with radiation given mars lack of magnetic field
spacex,not_removed,so radiation is not too big of a risk for above ground habitation in glass domes
spacex,not_removed,falcon is known to have such an effect already visibly apparent in videos of a launch im sure it was something they looked into for its apparently it just didnt work out that way though
spacex,not_removed,assuming theyre not working today
spacex,not_removed,is an answer which always leads to more questions da via hhgg
spacex,not_removed,my guess is that they wont know for sure until real life testing will occur engines is hard to simulate with enough precision to say how much if any improvements come from that kind of packing plus i doubt they had any rigorous simulations beyond aerodynamics and twrdv calculations its very early in the development cycle for this system
spacex,not_removed,ft ft version that seems to be the current state
spacex,not_removed,its like theyre picking and choosing from every hardware revision naming scheme ever next up falcon ausf f falcon okb falcon ixb
spacex,not_removed,falcon falcon falcon full thrust falcon falcon block possibly the most important company in human history good thing it focuses more on innovating than naming
spacex,not_removed,look at it this way he just retconned a sensible naming scheme in the entire family now we can just refer to them by block number
spacex,not_removed,yeah hes just trolling us at this point
spacex,not_removed,i cant wait to see what the new features are in falcon block thrust anniversary edition i hope they add an ai that will talk to us during the webcast
spacex,not_removed,fuller fullerer and fullerest thrust upgrades ft rolled out with flight in december other than maybe tiny incremental changes i dont recall any of these upgrades he planned for later this year but that didnt get put into place before amos unless it slipped by us
spacex,not_removed,someone needs to update from ukubrickismycopilot published in
spacex,not_removed,the naming scheme is based on kerbal space program
spacex,not_removed,isnt this the same thing nasa does like the sls block i and sls block ii
spacex,not_removed,before happened they did use block i ii as their public naming scheme
spacex,not_removed,block is probably the thrust upgrade he
spacex,not_removed,of all the words of that which i did not understand that was the word i understood the least
spacex,not_removed,thanks ftb
spacex,not_removed,this explains the minecraft mod thermal expansion using invar as its main resource fucking nerds keep it up
spacex,not_removed,the magic of invar is its thermal expansion is close to that of carbon composites the tools used for forming carbon composites are often made out of invar an invar coating wouldnt have as many thermal strain issues to solve
spacex,not_removed,there is a story that someone gave about him in the earlier days of spacex where he would sometimes corner the engineers and grill them for all they knew about what they were working on at first they thought he was testing them trying to call them out on their expertise but soon realized that he was taking in everything they had to say and learning he had some of the best experts in their field in the world under his roof so why not learn from them
spacex,not_removed,i mean photographic memory is basically a superpower
spacex,not_removed,iirc it was a scaled version let me find a link edit here you go
spacex,not_removed,even with the new spark ignition system on raptor
spacex,not_removed,i assume this is a book is it this one
spacex,not_removed,the company my father retired from used to cook metals in hydrogen powered furnaces for over years it sat on the edge of town and they had a tank of hydrogen about the size of a school bus just sitting next to the building a stray shot during dear season could puncture it no problem its still there now
spacex,not_removed,on behalf of all of us lots of video and camera angles please if the pressurization test is a success then nothing should be visible beyond a perfectly intact cf tank 🙃
spacex,not_removed,eh taking it up to burst pressure isnt exciting its just a pressure test for a vessel they arent testing to destruction if it survives boring if it doesnt well they wouldnt want to release that
spacex,not_removed,and please let those be the most boring videos of a tank just sitting there but show us anyway
spacex,not_removed,at the very least vague colourful graphs of the stresses pressures on it deformation
spacex,not_removed,seconded im looking at you ubencredible not because we want to see explosions but because we like looking at black shiny balloons on assimilated barges
spacex,not_removed,if that doesnt work try burst pressure this is a first prototype of the most difficult component so its unlikely to be perfect the first try im guessing theyd just use air or water not expensive dangerous propellant for this very first pressure test
spacex,not_removed,composite propellant tanks would be great because of their lighter weight than metallic tanks nasa has been interested in them for some time however nasa had also found that to be difficult especially for cryogenic propellants as found during the effort back in the early after that program was cancelled for many reasons but its tank failure during testing was the last straw there were some rd at nasa and subcontractors that suggested that the cryo composite tank problem was surmountable httpwwwnasagovcontentnasatestsgamechangingcompositecryogenicfueltankmarshallnews if spacexs tank holds up in testing then the company will appear to be leading the aerospace community in that area as well
spacex,not_removed,thats a huge tank of explosive stuff
spacex,not_removed,damn i wondered about that myself and thank you for posting the question
spacex,not_removed,it appears from the picture that the methane header tank is offcenter is it and if so why i think the reasons are theres a huge main lox pipe that has to come straight down methane tank would be in the way is a lot lighter and theres much less mass of it required due to the mixture ratio plus the com of the methane is a lot lower as well so it can be placed off center so off center methane tank does not hurt as much as off center lox tank
spacex,not_removed,im really sorry can someone explain this
spacex,not_removed,that is genius and i dont understand why nobody else realized that in all the discussions here
spacex,not_removed,keeping the mct acronym makes sense until the final name is decided makes it much easier to google it
spacex,not_removed,i like roc for the rocket given how huge it is
spacex,not_removed,the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion wikipedia the phoenix is a bird symbolizing destruction and rebirth id bet more money on the survival of a craft named the phoenix than the phoenix
spacex,not_removed,how about a name a plain old name
spacex,not_removed,pheonix is already a mars lander
spacex,not_removed,phoenix may imply it bursting into flames though not the best way to get people to sign up to take the ride to mars imo
spacex,not_removed,big fucking rocket isnt great for outreach especially for inspiring children big falcon rocket isnt really consistent with spacexs other names although when has spacex naming ever been consistent
spacex,not_removed,you mean big flying rocketwhats wierd about that i can totally explain that to small children
spacex,not_removed,sure seems like elon says it one day and it becomes fact
spacex,not_removed,a lot of things are based on science fiction start reading iain banks
spacex,not_removed,gets a bit meaningless with falcon falcon heavy big falcon rocket no obvious relationship at that point its a wholly new system so might as well give it a different naming system from falcon i really like eagle for the crewed ships for obvious reasons
spacex,not_removed,thats the name of the first spacecraft not of the system as a whole
spacex,not_removed,thats just for the first its to go to mars not all itss
spacex,not_removed,where do you see yourself in five years finishing my mba
spacex,not_removed,mars base alpha now youve gone and named it and a thousand nerds went squee
spacex,not_removed,feel free to elaborate on the mars base alpha power system
spacex,not_removed,is solar still going to be the early starter or is nuclear being seriously looked into
spacex,not_removed,here is a chart i found of δv at different time in the synodic cycle for mars intercept they range from kms to kms i havent checked it for accuracy
spacex,not_removed,for now spacex has reason to play nice with old space and sls otherwise those who are invested emotionally and otherwise especially senatorscongressmen in sls may decide to take aim at spacex and that would be bad for spacex its possibly for the greater good that sls continue to burn cash and possibly even launch a few massively expensive payloads so that spacex doesnt get stonewalled when they need to do things
spacex,not_removed,the reason it takes for orbiters and landers that are remote controlled about half a year to reach mars is cost a longer duration route in this case means less fuel is used and thus you need to carry less fuel with you into space meaning you can reduce cost a directerfaster route is always an option but it also depends on where in the solar system everyone is because you cant just point at point b from point a and go there in a straight line youve to take into account orbits and gravity with humans youd want to do it faster most likely because of the food and water they consume which is also added weight i dont know the numbers but i believe this is the main reason the its takes less time
spacex,not_removed,jump on kerbal space program and test it out
spacex,not_removed,yes but getting the first of them there is the initial hurdle i suppose sending them while theyre still eggs may be better theres still a lot to learn about interplanetary animal transport
spacex,not_removed,i imagine that the gs is not during landing but during reentry
spacex,not_removed,i imagine the engines would startup do an extremely short test burn and then idle at a minimum fuel burn until needed
spacex,not_removed,so there wouldnt be any hovering unless it encountered a problem or unexpected wind conditions i think this implies that it can hover but it will only do it if it absolutely needs to
spacex,not_removed,the spaceship would be limited to around gs nominal but able to take peak loads to times higher without breaking up would over a hundred tons of propellant sloshing violently during the marsearth edl flip maneuver be a complication or is there a trick against that edit the solution are the spherical tanks which contain the landing propellants they are full during landing so not much sloshing
spacex,not_removed,the spaceship would be limited to around gs nominal for comparison a normal commercial aeroplane take off is at gs gs is the maximum youd get in a formula one car when turning or heavy braking or the gs you get in httprollercoasterwikiacomwikihighestgforceonarollercoaster
spacex,not_removed,q similar to how the red dragon is expected to generate lift and steer via the movable mass sled how much lift will the spaceship generate on mars and are there control surfaces to assist with aerodynamic steering with the relative fragility of engine nozzles at what dynamic pressure will it be safe to fire the rcs thrusters and point the engines into the direction of travel thank you
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,ixv actually looks a lot like its in many ways o i wonder if esa will be sharing data with spacex
spacex,not_removed,add another set to the top split flaps come in opposing pairs the split does not refer to the split in the middle but that they face opposite directions this is so that the drag does not change the nose angle of the aircraft its equal upwards and downwards so the nose stays level with them on
spacex,not_removed,hmmm i hadnt considered that daisychain them for additional habitable volume
spacex,not_removed,the previous fu falcon rocket version was pg and much more interesting
spacex,not_removed,hey thanks for coding the bot dude can we add mba as mars base alpha now seeing as the word of god confirmed it
spacex,not_removed,god dammit mods this is why we cant have nice things
spacex,not_removed,just to point out cosmic radiation is usually extra solar in origin pointing at the sun does nothing to block that with that said over of the radiation comes from the sun and as you said putting fuel and water between people and sun will shield them
spacex,not_removed,had theyre been any discussion on how spacex plans to protect settlers from cosmic radiation once on mars
spacex,not_removed,im fairly certain that the autocomplete is an res feature and not built into reddit natively
spacex,not_removed,patently false the superior reach and intelligence of the us military is driven by the space program satellites are the us early warning spy and icbm navigation systems the might of the us military is a part of the guarantor of the usd
spacex,not_removed,a couple of caveats musk in the past has said that he expects intellectual property to be the chief export from mars and thats incredibly cheap to send back to earth also httpwwwnssorgsettlementmarszubrincolonizehtml that deuterium is five times more common on mars than on earth and tens of thousands of times more common than on the moon in a distant future where there are fusion reactors operating throughout the solar system that might mean something
spacex,not_removed,fairly useful as a base of operations for asteroid mining right right near the asteroid belt tow them into orbit around mars nice wide margin for error when the planet below is empty enough gravity that humans could plausibly spend more time there than our moon or deep space
spacex,not_removed,its more a question of whether mars makes an economical base for asteroid miners asteroid commodities will get sent back to earth probably with no intermediate stop at mars mars might or might not be a good place to grow food for spacers
spacex,not_removed,thats where its from elon musk is a legend
spacex,not_removed,kinda like exploring new lands in old times one way trip take it or leave it
spacex,not_removed,that apply to be a mars colonist thing last year showed just how many people are willing to sacrifice their life on earth for the chance to be the first wave to a new world
spacex,not_removed,actually the pyramids were built by paid farmers when they couldnt tend their fields not slaves
spacex,not_removed,its space travel its always risky
spacex,not_removed,be the first people on mars though even with guaranteed death they wouldnt struggle for qualified candidates
spacex,not_removed,as with all space travel there is risk even in this case it can be mitigated such as providing previsions for people to survive at least two full return cycles in the event additional equipment needs to be sent during the next rendezvous
spacex,not_removed,as long as they have enough supplies to wait for future resupply missions with additional parts for the propellant plant or barring that even propellant itself in a pinch seems ok as long as there is a reasonable contingency plan
spacex,not_removed,i think it was mentioned at the iac or around that time period that itd be a handful of people people groups would be later on when you have a colony able to support that many
spacex,not_removed,elon mentioned elsewhere in this ama that it will have a compliment of roughly
spacex,not_removed,this is a pretty staid structural engineering problem a basic solution is to dig a trench simple with earthmoving equipment install supports and a roof then cover with several meters of dirt this is exactly how old subway lines were built in manhattan and many other places its easier on mars in some sense because gravity is a lot less so your supports can be smaller note that five meters of dirt gives you the equivalent radiation protection of the earths atmosphere so thats a general figure that people throw around with five meters i believe it makes more sense to trench and cover than to try to tunnel which is more difficult the main challenge is getting enough earthmoving equipment to mars along with the prefabbed supports and roof
spacex,not_removed,theres already lava tubes and caves on mars nasa said they could potentially be used for colonies another cool thing is we could theoretically create a httpsenwikipediaorgwikisubterrene that would allow colonists to build miles of tunnel without having to install support structures because the melted rock would hold the weight once solidified anyway theres probably lots of options on the table for underground colonies
spacex,not_removed,main window on the its seems to fit the picture of such structure
spacex,not_removed,depending on how big the domes are sunlight reflecting off of them might be visible from space imagine looking out of the itss big window from lmo and seeing the glint of the city youre about to arrive at
spacex,not_removed,hope they can outfit the glass with transparent solar cells dual use
spacex,not_removed,would glass domes provide enough or any protection against solar or cosmic radiation though
spacex,not_removed,its definitely going to be a larger number of smaller domes large domes are impractical the volume ie air requirements grows with the cube of the diameter but the usable surface area under the dome only grows with the square of the diameter also the iss has many separate zones to allow isolation of leaks in the event of catastrophe submarines and warships use similar principles having redundancy and different zones built in would absolutely be at the very core of any basic martian colony design edit oh and one more thing the colony needs to grow over time it starts off small and then continually adds more people meaning more farmland and habitation space that necessarily means that more domes will be added over time as that is a lot easier than somehow attempting to continuously enlarge a single existing one theres no reason that mars habitats will be any different than earthbound cities in principle and on earth cities grow by adding more buildings its not like everyone in a city lives in a single building that they keep adding more floors onto a martian colony wouldnt be any different
spacex,not_removed,the tunnels i assume it would make sense to build them directly under the dome and they will probably have a lot of attached surface buildings above the surface
spacex,not_removed,its probably better to ask yourself that question spacex has enough on its plate just building the transport infrastructure how would you design it and fund it
spacex,not_removed,actually from an engineering standpoint doing the job with the smallest amount of materials a simple inflatable bubble would work fine the geodesic dome will actually be stronger than it would be on earth because more of the members will be in tension
spacex,not_removed,it would be a dome in tension rather than compression but domes are a good shape for tension too your upside down dome would require some vertical circumferential walls presumably how would that work
spacex,not_removed,this is what i want answered after he brushed off lauren grushs very sensible question about radiation protection at his mexico event im kind of miffed with how his explanations dont ever account for radiation
spacex,not_removed,it might just be that they havent run enough simulations to confirm it yet one way or the other or that theyll need real world testing to confirm them
spacex,not_removed,do you have a source for that
spacex,not_removed,how many raptor engines will an its booster have
spacex,not_removed,wouldnt it be block block ft block ft block block i still feel like we may be overlapping one of these iterations and that a block may have been jumped over and never produced
spacex,not_removed,im pretty sure hes gonna go the hollywood route and just name the next iteration falcon
spacex,not_removed,ill wait till the rocket of the year version comes out that way it has all the upgrades and dlc in it already
spacex,not_removed,there were a few significant incremental thrust upratings since then mostlyorall softwareenabled i cant recall how many or the specifics but they were doubledigit percentage thrust improvements they didnt have official names but coming as they did after the full thrust upgrade they were jokingly referred to as such its ridiculous how much performance they have squeezed out of those engines
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomelonmusk thrust at liftoff will be raised to lbf later this year it is capable of lbf in flight this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,sure it is but with nasa they generally stick to one naming convention at a time
spacex,not_removed,invar is just a metal that has a very similar coefficient of thermal expansion to carbon fiber so if you use it in a high heat application like molds or in this case a tank theyll expand and contract at the same rate and be less prone to cracks its also very very expensive
spacex,not_removed,seriously though gregtech has made me memorize so many alloys
spacex,not_removed,im sure the magic of invar is its thermal expansion would put a grin on ukinglemming s face
spacex,not_removed,so glad someone else knew invar from minecraft ha ha
spacex,not_removed,yup thats the only reason i know about invar myself haha
spacex,not_removed,i thought it was made up for that modtil
spacex,not_removed,i first heard that in the biography
spacex,not_removed,of course but he seems to have a deep understanding despite none of these things being his field of study most ceos have no idea this level of detail especially people with multiple companies
spacex,not_removed,if it was scaled it would be nice to know by how much in size not in thrust its in thrust
spacex,not_removed,engine start up isnt just spark and go its a series of well timed events that need to occur in order for an engine to get up to flight conditions
spacex,not_removed,yes thats the book its an excellent read especially about the and programs my excerpt was from a chapter on the experimental suntan which didnt make it very far thank you for clarifying the reference for othersi shouldve thought of that
spacex,not_removed,but who doesnt want to see multiangle footage of a cf tank sailing the oceans
spacex,not_removed,unless it explodes homie imagine all that liquid oxygenthe flamesthe flaaaameees
spacex,not_removed,or they might want to elon likes explosions
spacex,not_removed,they wouldnt want to release that are you sure theyve been pretty quick to release videos of their rockets exploding on the barge
spacex,not_removed,dry nitrogen is also commonly used for pressure testing incidentally this is probably being done on a barge because thats just easier than transporting it far enough inland safely its big enough that it would need to be barged anyway so makes perfect sense to me to just tow it out into international waters and do the test
spacex,not_removed,they would probably use water with some gas volume ideally you dont want to use air because it is more compressible meaning if the tank fails more energy is released bigger explosion
spacex,not_removed,wouldnt the lower offcenter help with the belly flop reentery also
spacex,not_removed,theres so much volume in the tube going from the oxygen tank through the methane tank that it holds all the landing lox they need
spacex,not_removed,look at the methane is in the lower tank and the landing reserves are in the small sphere in the bottom half the landing lox will be stored in the lox transfer tube that runs down the middle of the methane tank
spacex,not_removed,instead of having a separate tank the lox pipe from the tank to the engine is big enough to store the landing fuel
spacex,not_removed,i suggested that and got downvoted for it v
spacex,not_removed,looking at the bfr schematics again its even more brilliant by having all the residual lox in the bfr causes a shift in the cg to near the bottom of the rocket the remaining lox is completely removed from the upper tank and is now down in the ass end of the rocket in a regular rocket that would be disastrous it would want to flip around and fly backwards if the cg dropped to the rocket bottom but a returning bfr needs to fly backwards so not only do the bfr tanks allow for a smaller more manageable storage of the landing fuelox and help to lower boiloff it automatically resets the rockets cg to be extra stable while landing
spacex,not_removed,httpwwwseattletimescombusinessboeingaerospacepaulallensgiantplanetakesshapeinthedesertbutitsmarketisunclear
spacex,not_removed,it could be the ensurance of a rebirth of humanity in the event of earth getting blown up
spacex,not_removed,the falcon is merely to hide the fuck say falcon with the same emphasis as the word fuckin and you see how it works
spacex,not_removed,i think big fucking rocket would still inspire children i think it would be the parents that would have a negative attitude towards that name
spacex,not_removed,i wouldnt be so sure if a classroom full of kids started reading about how elon musk and his company sent a big fucking rocket to mars theyd probably remember that
spacex,not_removed,im asking about names for spacecraft like dragon and falcon not about acronyms like hts and vts horizontal test stand and vertical test stand respectively which is what elon talks about avoiding in the book you mentioned
spacex,not_removed,bfr is big fucking rocket but you cant say that on the news so big falcon rocket would keep the acronym and sound similar enough that anyone would understand the joke
spacex,not_removed,id prefer where did you get your mba at the mba
spacex,not_removed,that wont stick elon wont like the acronym mba
spacex,not_removed,now thats an mba that really interests me
spacex,not_removed,at that point in the program its will basically be brand new so it wouldnt have clearance from the ffa to launch lots of radioactive material anyway
spacex,not_removed,sadly the only way spacex can effectively stop that is to out bribe lobby the govt more than their competitors already spend
spacex,not_removed,humans use food and water but when they reach the mars surface they still consume food and water until the mars colony is sufficiently advanced to be really using that atmospheric carbon for producing things in terms of resource usage there isnt much difference between in the ship and on mars hence might as well take the long route to start with
spacex,not_removed,its hard to imagine anything that size decelerating at gees in sealevel atmospheric density dear god can you imagine the pancaking
spacex,not_removed,its actually just what theyre aiming for as the structural limit in normal ascent and descent it should only experience around gs sustained with peaks at gs
spacex,not_removed,i fear a minimum fuel burn is likely to be at least power so the engines cant really idle minimum thrust for the merlin engines is about
spacex,not_removed,hmm interesting thought i wonder how much propellant would still be around at that point
spacex,not_removed,divider walls like they have in firetruck tanks maybe might be too simple
spacex,not_removed,as a european i hope they are but honestly i doubt it
spacex,not_removed,its one of the things they wanted to do with shuttle tanks tow them into orbit and tie them together
spacex,not_removed,maybe if i see it getting used a bunch in the marsbase context not just yet
spacex,not_removed,he wrote that they intend to put a lot of mining and tunneling equipment on mars although he said its for industrial operations and domes for living spaces its not hard to envision building underground living spaces
spacex,not_removed,what advantages are there to producing ip on mars its a natural thing to happen once theres an established population but not a driver to establish one
spacex,not_removed,not to mention the autonomous spaceport drone ships which are named after different minds ai from iain m banks awesome culture series check it out if you havent
spacex,not_removed,turns out some billionaires are actually human and yknow like stuff
spacex,not_removed,the difference being that those new lands had an atmosphere water and food
spacex,not_removed,earthmoving equipment
spacex,not_removed,that is one of the coolest things i have heard about
spacex,not_removed,what company is specialized in building glass domes on mars
spacex,not_removed,theyd look so green against the martian landscape too absolute eyecatchers
spacex,not_removed,someone has to fanart this
spacex,not_removed,thanks that makes sense my immediate thoughts were just oh shit what if the dome explodeseveryone in it dies through some other means will humanity be dissuaded from trying to colonize planets for many more decades
spacex,not_removed,thats because he cant extended living on mars will be nearly underground if youre ok living like a mole then great but thats not what most people imagine when they think of living there
spacex,not_removed,he kinda said if you go you just have to be aware youll probably die from radiation poisoning and that eventually over time the problem would be solved possibly with a generated magnetic field
spacex,not_removed,or better yet just call the next iteration falcon
spacex,not_removed,also used in tiny watch components so you dont lose accuracy of time based on weather or ambient temperature
spacex,not_removed,is it particularly difficult to mix the iron and nickel in that ratio or is it a proprietary process or something iron and nickel individually arent expensive
spacex,not_removed,most ceos have no idea this level of detail im sure that this is a contextspecific issue but i am having some trouble thinking of a ceo with whom ive interacted that did not have a good working knowledge of all of the technical aspects of their business of course not as good as the specialists below them working at a closertotheground level and those that i am thinking about are ceos of fortune companies or other major companies yes they must work at the that is their job but they will not keep their position long if they show that they cant make strategic decisions informed by a good working knowledge of the technical details
spacex,not_removed,which is why
spacex,not_removed,i know that which is why i asked him if he thought the raptor team had mastered it yet
spacex,not_removed,my late grandfather worked at skunkworks on the we think i think im going to get that book ive always wanted to know more
spacex,not_removed,unless it explodes homie imagine all that liquid oxygenthe flamesthe flaaaameees actually a lox tank would be a pretty safe solution far less dangerous than a tank full of methane lox needs a lot of fuel to be truly explosive a lox tank could also be vented to the atmosphere after the test without undue fire and environmental risks
spacex,not_removed,will it be tested with liquid oxygen or something else at first
spacex,not_removed,not in his rockets he doesnt
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,falcon ground cam i could go on and on
spacex,not_removed,great explanation so about the methane tank why is it not tank shaped and how do all the engine pipes intersect it wouldnt that really reduce the max pressure they can run the tank at
spacex,not_removed,wow thats amazing
spacex,not_removed,spot on edit the linked comment was at zero when i got the link
spacex,not_removed,now is your moment of gratification
spacex,not_removed,we got you
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,a lot of us around here may think the name is fucking cool but im just imagining a school teacher explaining the historical event while trying to skirt around the word fucking
spacex,not_removed,the was called the buff big ugly fat friend that last word changed depending on who you talked to
spacex,not_removed,whats consumed on mars can be sent in another ship that takes longer
spacex,not_removed,people on mars surface will be more productive than in transit we want them on surface building the colony the sooner the better bulk cargo can be on the slower journeys much like people travel by airlines now but nonessential nontime sensitive bulk cargo is sent by sea
spacex,not_removed,a structure like the saturn would physically die
spacex,not_removed,according to the minimum thrust should be around
spacex,not_removed,i wonder how much propellant would still be around at that point a δv budget of between ms has to be available for mars edl with tons of payload tons of dry mass and secs of isp thats ie up to almost tons of propellant required for landing plus mission reserves
spacex,not_removed,yeah i was pretty miffed when i found out about that such wasted potential because they feared they wouldnt be able to convert the tanks on orbit they could have tried
spacex,not_removed,yeah right we all know its really to dig for that sweet ancient alien civilization tech p
spacex,not_removed,i dont think there are any distinct advantages other than that as zubrin again says there will be enormous pressure to innovate and find solutions to problems we havent even thought of yet in a hostile environment some of those will probably have broader implications i think the driver to establish a population on mars is the imperative that humanity must become multiplanetary to survive
spacex,not_removed,i would imagine that there will be some youtube videographers that will have some fun on mars for awhile and it will likely generate at least some traffic even if it is pure junk like a webcam from right outside of their house looking at some random group of martian rocks once the novelty of it drops off though i think that will be a really dry well to pull much from even though some really extreme sports like paragliding from olympus mons or across valles marineris will almost always get a few hits for the most part though the people on mars are going to be far too busy with building a colony rather than being active in trying to do much in the way of creative projects careful engineering is going to give way to jury rigged stuff thrown together that simply gets the job done at the moment and a whole lot of really awful folk music if that even gets created on mars at all there might be some interesting discoveries but those kind of things are going to be really hard to license on the earth and difficult to enforce payment when it does happen i really dont see httpswwwgnuorgphilosophynotiprenhtml really getting too much traction on mars for a long long time it really isnt going to drive any sort of planetary income to balance the amount of money that is going to need to come from the earth if you want to see the quality of content to expect from mars please watch produced by richard gariott aka lord british as the first film actually made and directed from a location other than the earth then again dont bother watching the film if you want to maintain your current iq or at least try to find some sort of mind altering substance first so you can enjoy it better
spacex,not_removed,atmosphere well yeah okay water if you could find it and it wasnt stillwater bugs diseases etc food which either fought back or had the possibility of being poisonous
spacex,not_removed,agree you may die early but you would be the first person to die on another freaking planet
spacex,not_removed,marsmoving equipment
spacex,not_removed,minertunneling droids
spacex,not_removed,well i thought it was boring
spacex,not_removed,theres your chance my man
spacex,not_removed,i dont know about mars but companies like corning are pretty experienced with glass
spacex,not_removed,companies that deal with similarly difficult conditions like deep sea tech
spacex,not_removed,i am sure corning will upgrade their gorilla glass to martian glass
spacex,not_removed,the cities on mars in cowboy bebop look similar to what hes describing
spacex,not_removed,eventually we may see domes craters or roofed canyons or other types of paraterraforming designed to create large open spaces tunnels could then be built into the walls of the crater or canyon
spacex,not_removed,falcon one
spacex,not_removed,proprietary
spacex,not_removed,richard branson theres a story about him not knowing what the hell was going on in a meeting so one of the guys that worked under branson kindly called him out and branson said yeah i have no idea what you guys were talking about so the guy explained it to him and branson rewarded him branson is one of those real guys though most ceos would pretend to know what they were talking about
spacex,not_removed,its really good even for those who arent super technically inclined like myself
spacex,not_removed,lox has a funny way of turning steel and carbon fiber into fuel
spacex,not_removed,so about the methane tank why is it not tank shaped spheres are actually the ideal pressure vessel shape and the cylindrical tanks seen in all rockets are actually compromises between pressure vessels and aerodynamic vehicles and how do all the engine pipes intersect it thats a great question honestly because it looks like the methane fuel inlets are right above the respective engines maybe the landing methane is injected into the maze of lox tubes at the bottom there
spacex,not_removed,thats why you hide the word fuck with the word falcon
spacex,not_removed,maybe with humanitychanging stuff like interplanetary colonisation well also get over stuff like swearing not causing the downfall of civilisation and if not well kids will find it interesting
spacex,not_removed,the media managed it with the god particle
spacex,not_removed,not to mention less time in transit means less radiation exposure this assumes structures built on the surface incorporate superior radiation shielding to that of the transit vessel
spacex,not_removed,i remember reading that the center engine on one of the saturn launches was recorded vibrating at gs that was sustained for the entire launch these things are tough
spacex,not_removed,wow that will make for quite a ride
spacex,not_removed,and your grave would be immortalized
spacex,not_removed,one day it will be
spacex,not_removed,i can see someone in hr already typing up the requirements for candidates must have at least years of tunneling experience on other planets low oxygen requirements preferred this is an entry level position
spacex,not_removed,good point
spacex,not_removed,just pointing out for others that its also on audible and with a decent narrator for those of us who prefer audiobooks
spacex,not_removed,lox has a funny way of turning steel and carbon fiber into fuel yes but theres not thousands of tons of it around in the middle of the ocean so any lox explosionfire would be much weaker than a matching methane tank explosion most of the explosive energy of a rocket is stored in the fuel tank not the oxidizer tank got truly powerful only once the lox mixed with the on the way down the biggest explosion triggered several seconds into the fire when the booster lox mixed with the booster
spacex,not_removed,i dont want to achieve immortality through my work i want to achieve immortality through not dying woody allen
spacex,not_removed,reminds of a quote from some nerd i want to die on mars just not on impact s
spacex,not_removed,hi thanks for your question could you please ask it in our cheers
spacex,not_removed,thanks will do
spacex,not_removed,hey can you ask this in our pinned ask anything thread instead cheers
spacex,not_removed,i skimmed it didnt really see much of anything new
spacex,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit four things spacex can do in to get its groove back footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
spacex,not_removed,also iirc commercial crew flight is not happening next year
spacex,not_removed,sad to see this got deleted eric berger is a respected space reporter his article has value even if it has no new info
spacex,not_removed,we dont approve articles based on who wrote them or how respected or not they are but by the content of the articles there is no new spacex information in this article and at times it is extremely misleading and flat out wrong like fh vs sls
spacex,not_removed,hi i found this an interesting read its not directly spacex related probably canshould be removed
spacex,not_removed,we could be the equivalent of the monolith to any martian microbes that live there our activities on that planet may well prove to be the stimulus that promotes their evolution thus far the red planet has been relatively stable for millions of years and stability does not encourage evolution putting human feet upon the soil of mars may prove to be the best thing that ever happened to those microbes
spacex,not_removed,there is the underlying assumption here that martian life and humans cannot coexist this in itself is highly dubious any martian life likely evolved when mars was very much earthlike thus terraforming mars would certainly benefit it with regards to thickening and warming the atmosphere although oxygenation could be a different story as for biological conflict i suspect humans will be much more vulnerable to martian life than viceversa wiping out microbes is the one extinction category humans have so far failed to master hell some of them can survive atomic bomb blasts from a few kilometers away
spacex,not_removed,is there an assumption that single cell organisms microbes bacteria viruses protozoa etc on mars would be rare and fragile and humans could extinguish them something humans cant even do to these things on earth
spacex,not_removed,you could argue the morality of going to mars and potentially risking the existence of life from mars all day long this argument will swing back and forth forever what i am more concerned about is if there is life on mars is it harmful to life from earth the last thing we would want is a plague from martian life wiping out all earthly life as we try and create a copy of earthly life to protect from this very thing
spacex,not_removed,on the contrary its very relevant spacex is likely to come into conflict with planetary protection in the coming decades so any discussion of planetary protection of mars is highly relevant
spacex,not_removed,most likely we actually killed a lot of virus protozoa and bacteria without realizing it we applied a strong selection pressure toward some of their members at least so we certainly destroyed some type of bacteria for example we might end up wiping out stapholoccus that are sensible to penicilline
spacex,not_removed,you know what i am worried about antibiotic resistance right here on earth unlike mars bacteria we know it exists and we know it will hurt
spacex,not_removed,plague from martian life wiping out all earthly life because of the way biology works that is very very unlikely our germs have evolved along side of us and have been trying to survive and flourish along side us trying to defend against them that some foreign life could have evolved to effect our biology is a stretch most likely martain life if it exists has a common root with earth likely diverging a long time ago and not evolved much since them because of environmental issues that they could evolve to effect earth plants and animals in the absence of any
spacex,not_removed,i agree with your point and think spacex is going to play an active part in all of the protect mars protect humans comply with international law things that ar going to come in the near future and i liked the centered tone of the article that said all this is way more speculative and argument prone than many other things so it might be more noisy than helpful
spacex,not_removed,we can hope that the progress we do on immunology will help us when most bacteria will be resistant to antibiotic and of course that means we might be able to protect ourselves against an eventual martial microbe
spacex,not_removed,much bigger worry and much more real
spacex,not_removed,most likely martain life if it exists has a common root with earth most likely based on what i understand the theory you are talking about and agree with your earlier points about the martian plauge fears but we dont know which genesis theory is correct or even what is most likely to be correct until we can study extraterrestrial life its all speculation and educated guesswork until then without a second data point we cant make that claim
spacex,not_removed,centered tone wait did we read the same article because the one i read was heavily slanted toward the authors position
spacex,not_removed,i was actually pleasantly surprised by the neutral tone of the article every other article i have read on the subject has been very definitely pushing one way or the other so it was a very refreshing read
spacex,not_removed,there has been a trade of derbies between earth and mars since the beginning of the solar system as there are martian rocks on earth there are earth rocks on mars the discovery of a martian meteorite that contained what looks like fossilized bacteria caused the renewed interest in looking for life on mars there is a broad theory that any life on mars has earth origins or maybe the opposite is true not speculating that our solar system was somehow seeded from outside but maybe that is true as you say we dont know if we find life on mars and it looks biologically like earth life and has the same spin as earth life it is likely common it the spin is other then it is likely not common but we dont have any data i agree just a theory that has been proposed that i happen to agree with
spacex,not_removed,after a recent it seems spacex will begin digging a tunnel its not specifically stated where or why the announced tunnel will be dug yet but the displayed danger to their staff gives a lot of backing to spacex constructing their own underground walkway to protect their own inline botfood
spacex,not_removed,im wondering if elon iswas having a troll when he suggested hed get into tunnels at the time he inferred that because of the time it took for his commute down the it would be better if he made his own tunnel everyone began thinking hed start a massive boring company and solve all the worlds traffic problems but with such small beginnings as a staff safety tunnel under a long wide road it might all just come to that and hes been pulling legs this whole time
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomelonmusk exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,of course hes trolling he stated that he was going to have his tunnel start across from his desk
spacex,not_removed,hi short questions are better asked in our ask anything thread the its cannot safely perform a pad abort it simply doesnt have enough thrust to do so
spacex,not_removed,since we all love and support elon lets use the power of the spacexsubreddit to help him become californian of the year it will only help spacex achieve its goals faster by gaining more publicity
spacex,not_removed,this was one of my concerns if the insurance companies didnt trust spacex the savings of reusable launch would be eaten up by increased insurance premiums spacex doesnt have to sell reusable rockets to the customers they have to sell them to insurers
spacex,not_removed,this will be interesting indeed i like the argument put forward by elon and shotwell that a reflown stage should buydown risk as compared to a new neverflown stage on the basis that a reflown stage has proven its flight worthiness we shall see if the actuarial side of things agrees
spacex,not_removed,good news indeed it will be interesting to see how premiums compare between a new booster and a reused booster and if said premium will grow higheror lower depending on the number of flights
spacex,not_removed,question how exactly are launches insured lets say a satcom operator launches a sat on falcon if the rocket goes boom who pays who does spacex pays back those
spacex,not_removed,they have the landed stages they have the costumers for them and now we know they have the certification process clearly figured out good news indeed
spacex,not_removed,does anyone know the scale of what the insurance premiums are like for that matter what say a thaicom satellite would cost would be interesting to think about what say a doubling in insurance cost would be vs dropping off the launch costs
spacex,not_removed,you got lucky p i was away from my desk for two seconds to charge my gopro for the iss pass in minutes anyway its great that they have a certification process in mind it should help reassure the commercial customers and hopefully nasa and the air force
spacex,not_removed,i wouldnt jump to a conclusion that the insurers are willing to cover the whole flight instead it would make perfect sense to only provide partial coverage ie everything that happens after nominal stage separation that way the known risks relating to or the satellite itself could be determined i expect people to disagree but the point is there is no way to assess the risk of a reused experiencing an anomaly

spacex,not_removed,honestly i think this is going to take many years before elons goal of airlinelike reusability reaches fruition makes a whole lot more sense to just take a core out to spaceport america and launch it times rather than waiting for commercial launches
spacex,not_removed,this is huge news once the insurance companies are willing to cover a reused stage then customers will start trusting their payloads on it and the whole reuse rocket economy gets started
spacex,not_removed,i dont see increased insurance costs having much of an effect on spacexs plans for reusability spacex will offer the first few launches at a discount and assuming the launches are successful insurance prices will drop quickly lightly used stages can may eventually be proven more reliable than virgin stages reducing insurance cost stages near then end of their life cycles may command increased insurance premiums and thus be reserved for less critical payloads the situation right now is not that different than when a new rocket starts flying payloads after a successful test flight
spacex,not_removed,im just curious but what do insurance underwriters know about rockets or anything technical it must be a hell of a pressure to have to say to your boss well i dont know how any of this works but im sure we can insure it profitably edit never mind was answered above
spacex,not_removed,this was one of my concerns if the insurance companies didnt trust spacex the savings of reusable launch would be eaten up by increased insurance premiums there were statements by ses that they did a little arm twisting on the insurers as a big customer they have some leverage they told insurers they would be first to fly falcon even if they do not get insurance do you insurers really want that turned out the insurers did not want that
spacex,not_removed,i think that is a short term concern after a while i think a reused stage should have no more risk associated than a new one in some ways it should be considered safer because it is a flight proven vehicle imagine how much insurance companies would charge to insure airlines if they wanted to fly passengers on the very first test flight of a new airframe
spacex,not_removed,just an order of magnitude guess but i would guess the insurance for the first reused flight would be more expensive but say the fifth flight may be less expensive than a first flight i wonder if it will be a matter of decommissioning boosters after every single digit increases in number of reflights and doing structural tests to alleviate concerns over fatigue it seems they have flights in mind per airframe so they would want to see how they are progressing to that mark
spacex,not_removed,its a nice problem to have and a whole new aspect of rocket launching the others who are constructing boosters will be looking at how spacex is treated they do need to demonstrate that their stages can fly multiple times for those assessing risks to start to lower premiums there will be a lot of ndas signed to allow assessors access to the information they need
spacex,not_removed,before launch satcom op pays spacex satcom op pays insurer launch goes fine satcom op makes money off sat launch fails insurer pays satcom op a predetermined sum sometimes the estimated cost of a rebuild relaunch and lost revenue and sometimes just launch cost depending on the contract and the insurance bill in the beginning
spacex,not_removed,there are kinds of insurance liability ins on the launch for people and structures property etc in the area mandatory ins on the outcome of the launch does the satellite reach orbit is it a good orbit on the proper functioning of the satellite short andor long term
spacex,not_removed,to add detail to what others have said the satellite operator and the company performing the launch both have to buy insurance the satellite operator has to buy two or three types of insurance one type covers everything before the launch someone drops itcrashes the truck carrying it the other covers everything that happens after including failure of the rocket and failure of the satellite ex solar panels dont deploy the launch company buys insurance to cover possible property loss including damaging the launch pad or falling on someones boat nasa got into an argument with orbital over how much their insurance covered damage to the launch pad apparently there was million in damage that was not covered note that the launch operators insurance does not cover the payload thats on them a more unreliable rocket higher launch costs for the operator and higher insurance for the launch company
spacex,not_removed,costumers would that be for a dress rehearsal
spacex,not_removed,i think it could be variable depending on what insurance is bought you could insure just the satellite but you could also purchase insurance to cover some losses from not having the active satellite the second part could be a huge portion of the premium
spacex,not_removed,premium just as a benchmark as of the end of the average for launch plus one year onorbit was of insured value however the market has softened further from there so likely slightly lower now the softer cheaper insurance market also leads to compression of spreads between launch vehicles so proven vehicles get less premium credit from relative newcomers the only one with significantly higher insurance costs is probably the proton
spacex,not_removed,im pretty sure the commercial sector doesnt need to be reassured for them even losing a satellite once in a while will be worth it compared to the delays and the high cost of rocket launches of today
spacex,not_removed,i am curious what things you believe would be different from a new aside from the obvious need of a new coat of paint of course
spacex,not_removed,meh its good news like the stock price of tsla going up elon resents making tesla a public company at all so the point im making is once the insurers get used to a specific certification process every reusable launch vehicle will have to be meticulously inspected and repaired more like space shuttle than commercial airliner
spacex,not_removed,eventually once they get statistically significant data on relaunches they will no doubt be happy to insure reusable rockets the early few i could see them having concerns about how to price the risk
spacex,not_removed,companies offer insurance satellites get launch successfully insurance company profits companies do not offer insurance satellites get launched successfully anyway insurance company loses out big time
spacex,not_removed,i agree with this in the long run use might be considered the safest flight its like a static fire however the aggregate potential effects of unidentified wear has to reduce the reliability in the long run also its important to remember that stage of the has a success rate on launch was what failed in people saying that a reused stage is more reliable than a new one have an awfully high bar to clear
spacex,not_removed,i feel sorry for their lawyers who will need to draft them all
spacex,not_removed,is there no penalty at all to the launch operator in case of a failure
spacex,not_removed,the satellite operator has to buy two or three types of insurance thats news to me any sources why should anyone i assume the government force any satellite operators to insure themselves against this type of loss of property
spacex,not_removed,i think it could be variable depending on what insurance is bought you could insure just the satellite but you could also purchase insurance to cover some losses from not having the active satellite the second part could be a huge portion of the premium not to mention insurance may also cover the costs of a new launch launch prices typically dont include a new launch if yours ruds you can buy insurance or you can roll the dice
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,that doesnt make a whole lot of sense modern comsats cost a lot the legacy satellites costed not including launch about million and theyre still growing in cost and complexity with adding considerable capability and mass at this pricepoint the most expensive of launchers dont make much of a budget impact a full up ariane shot costs about of what the satellite does and the launchers only get cheaper from there as a result the companies who are interested in launching these big comsats which is most of the satellite market now are much more interested in reliability than cost lets say that you have a in risk factor and estimate that a satellite costs about million to billion youre then seeing a virtual cost of to million in terms of incurred risk from launch while all of the launch providers around are averaging considerably better than in the point holds it costs less for a customer to pay million more to avoid million in additional risk and the insurance companies exist to do this kind of math what spacexs job here is to do is to demonstrate that the risk in terms of expected losses of reflying a booster is less than the savings that you get from riding on a reused booster now that first caveat is very interesting as expected losses are dependent on what the customer is actually launching weve been talking about big monolithic geostationary comsats so far but there are other customers like orbcomm who are launching many smaller cheaper satellites these customers are more than willing to accept a risk increase because the cost of that risk is small to them on the other hand we have monolithic government scientific missions like jwst and its ilk who make the billion commercial satellites look practically cheap and who are therefore extremely sensitive to risk especially since unlike the companies they probably wouldnt ever get a second shot
spacex,not_removed,i imagine when rockets become reusable and cheap the satellites will as well today all satellites have to be made to last years and when reusable rockets are flying regularly this might fall down dramatically they will become cheaper and less expensive to take advantage of the low cost
spacex,not_removed,which will only be true once satellites are much more replaceable than they are now right now they are so custom that losing a satellite is losing a lot and since satellite companies have to predict the market years out at least losing a satellite might mean the entire market that satellite targeted wont be worth it
spacex,not_removed,i find that highly unlikely the cost of a satellite often far exceeds the high cost of a launch it makes more economic sense to fly on an expensive reliable booster than a cheap unreliable one thats not conjecture you can see how much business the proton has lost since it became unreliable and it was the cheapest option on the market before falcon arrived
spacex,not_removed,while i personally think flying a reused incurs only a bit more risk it doesnt matter here what were discussing is the ability of the insurance companies to assess this risk and for them these are uncharted waters
spacex,not_removed,eventually once they get statistically significant data on relaunches they will no doubt be happy to insure reusable rockets the early few i could see them having concerns about how to price the risk there are plenty of events for which no meaningful statistical data exists yet you can buy insurance against those events insurance companies are pretty good at estimating risk so here theyd want to know what kind of extra checks a spacetested booster goes through before it is launched again and how it compares to existing qa of freshly manufactured boosters insurance companies particularly like events with low but hard to judge probabilities humans tend to overestimate their true importance so it allows an increase in premiums insurance companies dont have a fundamental problem with insuring unprecedented events the thing that insurance companies hate most are rare events that are low probability are hard to estimate but when they happen they hit very valuable structures or hit a very large number of customers requiring a big payout relaunching a space tested booster is not such an event its not rare because theres a set date and the mission will either be a success or not theyll come to an agreement
spacex,not_removed,it may come to pass that reused rockets are actually more reliable than new ones because the systems are known good it all depends on how the rocket fares experiencing max q multiple times i could definitely see a future where its more expensive to insure a new rocket though
spacex,not_removed,not quite faa regs require the launch to be insured to some extent
spacex,not_removed,which is why they will probably periodically take one out of rotation and core sample the structure then the wear will not be unknown
spacex,not_removed,those poor lawyers and all their billable hours wont someone think of them
spacex,not_removed,as a lawyer i would happily do that work
spacex,not_removed,if the failure destroysdamages property of a third party they have to cover it if it doesnt no direct penalty as far as i know just the loss of confidence of customers and rising insurance cost for customers and the resulting loss of business
spacex,not_removed,is there no penalty at all to the launch operator in case of a failure only part of the launch cost is paid up front by the customer the rest is paid upon successful delivery to target orbit if the launch fails the customer doesnt have to pay the second part but will not get the first part back
spacex,not_removed,youre not forced to ses didnt buy insurance for their first flight they couldnt find someone willing to do it at a price they wanted however the launch operator does have to buy insurance in order for their launch application to be accepted the payload is not covered by this though
spacex,not_removed,in most places you have to have car insurance to drive a car it shouldnt be surprising then that you need it when driving a rocket with cars its mostly to protect everyone else on the roadie liability insurance that is legally required in most sectors insurance law is geared towards making sure you can make amends for whatever you might do to someone else id guess that with rockets its much the same often companies are allowed to selfinsure at least partially which means that rather than paying some company say to promise to cough up if something goes wrong they set aside the mil themselves and say theyll pay it i seem to recall reading spacex sometimes does this
spacex,not_removed,launch prices typically dont include a new launch if yours ruds no but they are typically paid by milestones and the most expensive one tend to be reaches target orbit meaning the customer doesnt pay full price for a failed launch
spacex,not_removed,well yes i think thats the interesting question to what extent the high costs of delivery to orbit pushes you to build bigger satellites that you then make more expensive because you cant have all of those eggs in one basket get broken but if launches are cheap and plentiful especially if we move to a world where maybe we start selling the marginal extra capacity of launches to microsats even more than we do now does the whole model change can we get to a world where you make lots and lots of small cheap sats and if you lose a rocket every so often thats just life it might be net cheaper
spacex,not_removed,thats the trick though its not all that easy to reuse refurbish or even safely dispose of a gso comsat when it runs out of maneuvering fuel and starts drifting out of its slot
spacex,not_removed,not to be harsh but its not something you can really source its just misinformed speculation we know that launches are a small fraction of the cost of building and operating a satellite so losing one once in awhile is in fact a big deal
spacex,not_removed,sounds like supposition what gets real interesting to me is when we reach a price and congestion point on the graph where something like deorbit cubesat missions start flying
spacex,not_removed,what were discussing is the ability of the insurance companies to assess this risk and for them these are uncharted waters insurance companies will weigh that risk against the opportunity to make an extra couple of million dollars for what will very likely be a flawless launch with very little work as long as they see that the certification of a spacetested stage is just as stringent as that of a newly manufactured one they should be happy also only the very first such launch will have a hefty insurance premium insuring subsequent launches should be much cheaper spacex might be willing to counteract the extra insurance cost of that by offering a new launch slot outside the regular launch manifest queue plus a discount on the launch price insurance companies might also be interested in getting those launches going a much higher launch cadence is good for the insurers as well it generates more income for them so this is something all three parties insurers customers spacex want to see happen thus they will very likely come to an agreement
spacex,not_removed,and after all when they cant estimate the risk accurately they just put in a massive fudge factor to make sure they are well outside the error bars and guaranteed a profit this is the issue spacex is having to contend with
spacex,not_removed,ses is rich enough to self insure meaning they have a collection of aaa securities that they can put up as bond the minimum insurance is much like what we saw operating in the antarescygnus launch of liability to protect people and facilities on the ground there is also insurance on if the payload gets to orbit and if it operates properly when it gets to orbit these last forms of insurance are not mandatory so far as i know
spacex,not_removed,unlike in russia where they will happily launch cough zvezda cough without insurance
spacex,not_removed,as someone who has seen an itemised bill that included gems like stop wait and peruse document telephone call to xxxxxx no answer left message they have my deepest sympathys
spacex,not_removed,interesting i guess not having any customers anymore is quite an incentive makes sense
spacex,not_removed,interesting how might that be divided
spacex,not_removed,the problem is in the gto launch market there are only so many orbital slots in the sky you can make more but where will you put them
spacex,not_removed,geo communications satellites are like mainframes a failure would devastate company viability and profitability so long as satellites take years to design construct program certify and integrate with an lv satellite costs will remain high launch price has little do to with overall satellite cost architecture drives cost more than anything else these leo satellite swarms may or may not be viable if they are costs will plummet if not satellite costs will continue upward
spacex,not_removed,someday that stuff might be really useful as prelaunched free metal but thats a long way down the road
spacex,not_removed,so now we just need someone to build a large robot that can fly to space and keep things tidy
spacex,not_removed,this is the issue spacex is having to contend with thats not really a long term problem to spacex theres competition in the insurance market and a predictably good launch provider like spacex must be good business any eventual launch failure insurance costs will be amortized in follow up insurance premiums while the premiums in case of launch success will be pocketed so for the insurers enabling a higher launch cadence is a winwin pretty much so insurance costs should match the true risk and volatility plus insurance markup long term all that matters to spacex is to get the ball rolling the rest will sort itself out
spacex,not_removed,yes the faa will require liability insurance up to the pml probable maximum loss that they have agreed upon with spacex during the licensing process prior to launch the liability launch and onorbit covers would be separate with some possibility of the launch plus onorbit cover being packaged for the purposes of the underwriting process for reused boosters only the launch and liability covers really come into play
spacex,not_removed,seriously i have paid bills that include email to bob email from bob what was the email hey does this work for you yep thanks
spacex,not_removed,it depends on the contract i dont know what percentages are typical but i think most of the cost is usually paid before launch
spacex,not_removed,douglas adams said it best space is big really big you just wont believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is i mean you may think its a long way down the road to the chemist but thats just peanuts to space
spacex,not_removed,mainframes are still around the market just got larger spacex is also aiming for human rated space flight with a failure rate of spacex cant just be the low cost provider they need to be highly reliable as well what price points do the leo swarms depend on spacexs longterm goal is to drop the price down to million per launch but im assuming they will maintain a healthy profit margin until the competition catches up do things need to hit million or will the smaller electron rockets be good enough for the leo swarms
spacex,not_removed,if its not disposed of properly and it starts drifting into someone elses gso slot its not free metal though its a multibillion dollar lawsuit waiting to happen
spacex,not_removed,exactly this because of competition if the average profit after average payouts are factored in is lets say million for insurance provider a there will be an insurance provider b thats willing to take and insurance provider c willing to take etc insurance companies love them some actuarial tables and once a reasonable number of reuse flights are under the belts theyll have a good idea of what their payout schedule looks like and a competitive industry will be born
spacex,not_removed,do things need to hit million or will the smaller electron rockets be good enough for the leo swarms leo swarms can work on rockets today oneweb for instance is using using soyuz to launch most of its satellites smaller rockets like electron work for one off projects and maybe launching replacement satellites but overall small launchers offer terrible kg so oneweb would be better off using soyuz to launch the majority of their satellites
spacex,not_removed,i understand the local nimbys complaints not being able to swim on their local beach would suck and hey somebody put a big ass rocket pad in their backyard but their anger should be directed at the state government who spent to bring them to that location this project projected will create some high paying aerospace jobs and closing the beach down on launch days is for their own safety as far as whether they have a case regarding the closure of the beach texas open beaches statute allows the tx general land commission the power to promulgate regulations allowing seems to me that they might have a amendment taking of property without due process due to these restrictions on their movement on launch days and in essence negating the residents property to virtually zero value however a court likely would not hear such a case as it is not yet ripe no injury has yet been done to the residents
spacex,not_removed,what a terribly written article the typo in the title was there too
spacex,not_removed,man id love to live there to hell with the beach i get to watch a launch from only a mile away
spacex,not_removed,the bigger issue besides going to a swim on launch day is though something else for the village what
spacex,not_removed,isnt the launch site less than miles from south padre island thats a pretty big summer resort town which would be quite amazing to watch from on launch day tbh but if we assume that the bfr is like the saturn v in terms of sound at then at miles away sound would still be at wouldnt that level still be a concern for earplugs or would that be not an issue
spacex,not_removed,about homesbarns within a mile most are about mile away from the main site they are not below the flight path spacex would be able to relocate most of these if they would accept an offer to move not too far perhaps miles away and the structures could be used to house spacex personnel until newer buildings could be built
spacex,not_removed,how is boca chica not in the immediate danger zone for a launch failure of the bfr the second launch was one of the biggest man made non nuclear explosions in history and was raining debris for miles this was supposedly with only around of the propellant burned in the takeoff and explosion the bfr is supposed to have a much more massive propellant load so i just dont get how spacex could even have people that close at all
spacex,not_removed,warning this report is full of inaccuracies i suggest people to take anything in this report with a grain of salt more here
spacex,not_removed,austrian reporter nina hochrainer has visited the boca chica village and talked to the people about the situation why is an austrian reporter so concerned with protecting the interests of a small texas village

spacex,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibocachicavillagetexas population
spacex,not_removed,boca chica is not an incorporated area they have not formed a government and they have almost zero say in what happens in their town or in the surrounding area cameron county is the only entity with any kind of authority in the area and the state of texas does not grant counties the same kind of authority they grant actual municipalities like brownsville the state government is the only one with authority and agencies like the tceq can only limit activities if there are complaints within the immediate vicinity of the launch facility where there currently are no residents living were talking hundreds of feet texas wet beaches are state property even if boca chica formed a government no city or residents can own the beaches while texas residents have free access to texas beaches the state does have the right to close beaches down in dangerous conditions be they hurricanes or rocket launches imminent domain is strong in texas and if projects like the central texas highspeed railway or the arlington football stadium could not be defeated by residents in actual cities boca chica residents have zero chances of avoiding a land grab if spacex wanted to be undiplomatic about it in my experience as a texas resident spacex is being much nicer to the local residents than any other company would be or has been in the past unincorporated areas have zero power the only people listening to them are the media and spacex and the media just wants ad money
spacex,not_removed,frankly i would love it i would use the evacuation as an excuse to watch every launch lol
spacex,not_removed,i wish we lived in the world where spacex could buy sq ft mansions for all these folks in florida or la and then permanently close the beach and launch as much as possible unfortunately the only people living all the way out in boca chica are the crazy types who probably would never sell
spacex,not_removed,there is no restriction of movement during launch days except no beach access on launch days i read on nsf that there is a recommendation to wear ear protections when outside during launch which will be provided by spacex there is also a restriction of visitors to the area during launch there is also no attempt to force them out of the area spacex is trying to buy some or all of the houses which should drive prices up not down there are also not complaints from what a new resident says most if not all of them are mostly if not completely ok with the new neighbour
spacex,not_removed,eems to me that they might have a amendment taking of property without due process due to these restrictions on their movement on launch days and in essence negating the residents property to virtually zero value my understanding is that our beaches in texas are all state property supreme court ruling sets up the dividing line between vegetation and mean high tide while they are losing property value due to changes outside their property this is something every property owner is always at risk of it doesnt sound like there are any abnormal restrictions on the private property itself
spacex,not_removed,a amendment someone crying eminent domain in texas could trigger all the bundy types to occupy space xs facility
spacex,not_removed,this project projected will create some high paying aerospace jobs of zero value to the locals
spacex,not_removed,but their anger should be directed at what makes you think that people in general intelligent species b
spacex,not_removed,im sure itd be cool for a while but if they ever get their launch rate to something like every other day i could see it getting old after a while
spacex,not_removed,i cant believe people would be allowed to stay so close to the launch pad during a launch how big is the security perimeter at ksc during launch i thought it was multiple miles
spacex,not_removed,upon stumbling i was certain the author was german which is true what he wanted to say theres a bigger issue for the village than not being able to swim on a launch day gotta love these kinda mistakes somehow its always fun to see foreign grammar applied to other languages
spacex,not_removed,you would want plus thats like sitting on an air field when a is landing
spacex,not_removed,i dont think that section of south padre that close to the launch site is that busy you have to go a few miles further north to get developed areas i used to live in corpus christi
spacex,not_removed,the closest house to the boca chica pad is miles the control center is right outside the village of houses
spacex,not_removed,i just dont get how spacex could even have people that close at all the answer is they dont at the moment they plan to launch falcon and falcon heavy if they want to move to bfr it is probably not distant enough so they would need to move those few people out of the area or imo they move the launch site out into the sea by a number of km
spacex,not_removed,actually nsf contributor nomadd is the guy who has bought a property there because of the launch site he is in close contact to the residents and he does not see strong resentment of spacex at all spacex are not just distributing information they actually send people to speak with the residents they have also told them once the fibre connections are installed the village will get high speed internet access too
spacex,not_removed,we had a town meeting in my back yard a few days ago the main issue was why somebodies pepper plant was looking sickly i voted fungal infection kinda gives you an idea of the pace here gold
spacex,not_removed,she probably is the spaceflight tech or maybe even usa correspondent for her media station believe it or not some austrians take interest in the usa
spacex,not_removed,as of only people were permanently living in the village
spacex,not_removed,thats completely wrong eminent domain for private purposes is almost impossible in texas since they passed a bill after the kelso supreme court decision
spacex,not_removed,there is always the frequently misused abused approach eminent domain edit for better clarity
spacex,not_removed,part of the problem with large developments is you get people who want that or more as the minimum for properties that without this development are worth way less than the average us house price and if you do not pay them off they will try and throw every wrench they can into the project it would not be a surprise if some of the loudest voices were purchased either after it was selected or one of the last few on the list specifically to flip it for a profit
spacex,not_removed,the lawn melting seems to possibly indicate that one of them had a malfunction and went the wrong way and would probably require a failure in the self destruct to make it that far off course
spacex,not_removed,its probably a few people who have been pushing for this suit like the saratcha factory complaints all coming from one house that just happens to be owned by the cousin of a city councillor
spacex,not_removed,between this and the houstondallas hsr project i almost want to see them try i expect that theyd make a big show appear ridiculous throughout and fail to gather support outside their own base
spacex,not_removed,rtls bundy
spacex,not_removed,aerospace employees use local shops if you own a grocer or barbershop in the area you benefit
spacex,not_removed,its so exciting that living near launch facilities will be the new living by the airport how absurd the idea used to seem of a launch every few hours
spacex,not_removed,about miles although access points through the area are pretty limited so getting closer than that is tough anyways i am actually a little dumbfounded they are this close to the pad to start with im not sure what the safe distance at vandy is but given how tight that area is im sure its closer than ksc
spacex,not_removed,i speak german and it still doesnt make sense to me that whole sentence just gave me a headache
spacex,not_removed,no the town on south padre island is right at the southern tip
spacex,not_removed,imagine if you found a place you enjoyed living and some company wanted to come along and force you out that would suck big time there is no forcing out yes it sucks but thats life it happens all the time everywhere there is no guarantee that a local backwater remains backwater forever reaching out and trying to placate fears is part of it for a reasonable company and i understand spacex is trying that i do wonder if there could be forcing out of residents when there is build up for bfrmct but that is not on the table right now also the number of permanent residents is much smaller than many are part time or weekend residents i dont think we should just ignore what residents have to say they had the chance to speak up during the proceedings for granting permissions they were extensively informed and there were no complaints at some time a company must be able to rely on permissions and have protection of their investment
spacex,not_removed,look on the bright side it will probably increase their property values once regular launches start occurring as the people who work at the site probably dont want to take a road trip just to go to work
spacex,not_removed,echo from my understanding no one is complaining the resident on nsf says all the articles are completely misrepresenting the residents and all of them are either loving spacex or are ambivalent to them a few have a few tiny misgivings but they largely dont care
spacex,not_removed,these people live there because it is cheap some are retired but they live there because it is cheap spacex moving them to new homes miles away will be a bonanza to them
spacex,not_removed,really where exactly is the pad there does not seem to enough room to place the pad miles from the houses
spacex,not_removed,yes i follow the thread closely
spacex,not_removed,im actually in the netherlands and pretty obsessed with spacex but im still bewildered as to why an austrian journalist would be knocking on doors in boca chica theres so many ways to cover spacex i just dont see why this is the angle they chose
spacex,not_removed,eminent domain that would certainly be an interesting legal argument to read the original purpose of eminent domain was to allow the public government to take private property for public use but here they would be takingrestricting both private property houses and public property beach access on launch days for exclusively private use by a private corporation
spacex,not_removed,part of the problem with large developments is you get people who want that or more as the minimum for properties that without this development are worth way less than the average us house price and if you do not pay them off they will try and throw every wrench they can into the project if i were a resident to be bought out i would want more than the pre spacex prices too i would want enough that i can buy something similar elsewhere which is probably a lot more even if it is not a sq ft mansion
spacex,not_removed,it is unclear to me if there is actually even one seriously opposing spacex and considering a lawsuit just a few journalists trying to stir the pot i may see this wrong but i will wait until a suit actually is filed
spacex,not_removed,probably the actual residents of boca chica are mostly retirees with no business to gain anything through though most of the businesses business owners etc are likely in brownsville itself so while the general area benefits those few people dont get anything if they dont enjoy rocket launches tough to be them i suppose
spacex,not_removed,if translate it word by word its das größere problem neben dem schwimmen gehen an einem starttag ist aber ein anderes für den ort yeah its still not the yellow from the egg p
spacex,not_removed,it happens all the time everywhere is really not a good enough excuse imo i understand that the launch site will become necessary for spacex and that they probably searched for a site which would deranged the least amount of people but still its a real problem for the local i love spacex as much as anyone here but their progressions is causing discomfort for some people inevitable maybe but its not the locals fault like you seem to imply
spacex,not_removed,info from wiki as of only people were permanently living in the village
spacex,not_removed,there was almost an all out brawl during the proceedings
spacex,not_removed,for many people its not about the money i would be careful before summing up the total reasons behind a group of people living somewhere in general every human has their own story
spacex,not_removed,people in the village can walk to the bay a few hundred feet away most days and fish or kayak they can be on a beach in minutes where you can go for miles most days without seeing a soul they live in the middle of a wildlife refuge with no idiots blasting away with watt stereos or mufflerless trucks everybody knows everybody and theyre all ready to help with whatever you need maybe you cant understand why they dont want to trade that for a prettier house but thats not their problem
spacex,not_removed,pretty much on the beach about feet east of the mesa they just built
spacex,not_removed,others may not good that you posted the link
spacex,not_removed,eminent domain has been used abused for decades to transfer property to developers and not for schools highways or other public use eminent domain specifically has been used to move property for underutilized to maximum utilization read maximum property tax for developers all across the nation this is certainly not my opinion of how eminent domain should be used but facts are facts
spacex,not_removed,those aerospace engineers and spacex pay taxes from which local residents would indirectly profit
spacex,not_removed,a shooting range about a mile away maybe some sales of other items there
spacex,not_removed,they got a new road to there property
spacex,not_removed,it happens all the time everywhere is really not a good enough excuse imo thats true but i still thing there is a valid point behind it infrastructure for just about anything displaces something else you cant build a mall stadium highway development or launch complex without dramatically affecting what was there already eminent domain is often a raw deal for those its exercised upon but it exists because its necessary if the majority of a population deems it worthwhile then the little guy gets paved over it sucks but thats the flip side to democracy the best that can be done is to take into consideration how this affects people attempt to limit how invasive it is when possible and make sure people get a fair deal if its decided to move them out if local government cuts a deal with spacex for bfr this could very well be the result
spacex,not_removed,its not the locals fault like you seem to imply where did gp imply that its a fact of life that some people are impacted by the actions of other people especially by big infrastructure projects like a launch site its common practice to take such impact into account but not let it stop the project from happening unless the impact is considered to be greater than the benefits of the project can justify
spacex,not_removed,should have bought all the land nearby if seclusion is what was wanted same as anywhere if you do not own the land you do not control it
spacex,not_removed,they can walk to mexico or south padre island i would have thought padre island would be more isolated for spacex purposes
spacex,not_removed,this is certainly not my opinion of how eminent domain should be used but facts are facts i think thats exactly how eminent domain would always end up getting used if you dont look at it from a cynical perspective both public and private projects can be of great interest and benefit to the general public if the local government in texas chooses to eminent domain the whole area in favor of giving spacex the land for a full bfr complex they are choosing to build the worlds first interplanetary spaceport in their local district they would be turning a sparsely populated area into a massive center for a high tech industry that has a lot of benefits as i said in another comment part of the drawback to democracy is that sometimes the little guy gets outvoted and loses this is likely to be what happens in boca chica
spacex,not_removed,eminent domain specifically has been used to move property for underutilized to maximum utilization read maximum property tax for developers all across the nation yes but most of those cases are using the loophole that they can claim that developing an unused area mostly for housing will improve public utilization of that area you could move there too once the homes are built so it gets turned into a common good i do think spacex is a common good economically scientifically and morally but legally its not its a private for profit corporation the public is not allowed to participate in the quintessential inverse of any public entity spacex doesnt want to develop the area and then sell the homes to the public spacex wants to keep and use it indefinitely using eminent domain to forcibly transfer property from one private entity to another without any guaranteed recirculation of the property to the public is making a mockery of the concept thats why i think its going to be an interesting legal argument if it ever goes so far
spacex,not_removed,a shooting range about a mile away that shooting range was initially behind the checkpoint and would have lost business on launch days after they complained the checkpoint was moved so they are no longer affected
spacex,not_removed,the guy who owns the range is putting bleachers up to watch the launch from its about miles from the pad
spacex,not_removed,actually youre right they will probably see not just a new road and a newer new road since that new road is getting destroyed by trucks but possibly some new utilities though other than bringing in wireless internet i dont know if it would be feasible to do anything else in the village the cost to bring in municipal water or such may not be worth the investment etc at least i think they dont have a municipal water hookup there
spacex,not_removed,using eminent domain to forcibly transfer property from one private entity to another without any guaranteed recirculation of the property to the public is making a mockery of the concept it is being done every day throughout the us almost everyone is against that usage but it continues and yes it is absolutely disgraceful in my opinion however it is a fact of life there are initiatives to change the laws governing eminent domain to prevent this abuse where i live they just used eminent domain to put property in the hands of a private developer so that private developer could take the very desirable property of homeowners and small business owners and redevelop the area into a resort shopping project despicable but it occurs all the time in this case both the local government and the developer are just two faces of corruption in our area with long term property tax abatement and other incentives the developer is the only one that will benefit in the short term and the long term
spacex,not_removed,they are trucking all the water in
spacex,not_removed,no wells
spacex,not_removed,nope its a morass no wells in boca chica proper either
spacex,not_removed,elon making crazy new goals just as the one he and his team have been chasing for years has just been achieved awesome
spacex,not_removed,we have those cost
spacex,not_removed,ambitious as always god speed spacex
spacex,not_removed,now to tackle the rapid part of rapid reusability the journey has only begun
spacex,not_removed,within hours basically means no refurbishment or extended testing and just the usual prelaunch testing
spacex,not_removed,looks like that is the true goal of the falcon block v rocket launching twice within hours requires a fundamental change in how we view a launch on a modern jetliner the failure of the smallest part could cause the flight to end in an emergency landing yet they do not deeply inspect the engines between flights it appears that the block v is designed with this in mind it also tells me that falcon block v will be the first rocket designed to land directly on the launch mount perhaps it will have a dual mode where it can use landing legs for and barge landings or the same system its will use to land on the pad itself one of the most important missions this new falcon might have is simply launching bulk water or cargo containers into leo does not sound like much but this means a facility in orbit can convert that water into hydrolox propellant which means ulas aces stages will actually have propellant to do things such as pushing heavy probes to the outer planets without the requirement for time consuming slingshots or mining of near earth asteroids that stuff in well into the yes yet now it is atleast on the horizon as opposed to pure science fiction of the

spacex,not_removed,you gotta wonder if ses doesnt just say thats our booster from now on it would be cool to see all their launches on the same booster
spacex,not_removed,could they get a bigger ship that can sail out to the destination under its own power at a significantly faster speed than the asds tow it looks like blue origins larger vessel will be able to more quickly reach its destination and return back to port could that be a part of the buildup for more rapid reusability or just increasing the number of existing asdss
spacex,not_removed,i wonder how many times they could repeat a hour turn around in a row
spacex,not_removed,i think the key to hour reusable is the ability to land back on the launch pad im basing this prediction on the ipt video it may be years away but i think that will be the eventuality of the falcon early on musk once said hour relaunch and i think thats the only way they can get there who knows what the guts of would have to look like for that to work
spacex,not_removed,is that even possible with a drone ship landing
spacex,not_removed,elon should be proud a company he founded has accomplished something that not only has never been done but that many people thought was impossible as for the hour turnaround they must be planning to eventually land back on the land clamps essentially or at a minimum back at the pad if they manage a week turnaround for reuse it will be impressive hours would be mindblowing
spacex,not_removed,fantastic job guys any idea on when we can expect that goal to be achieved
spacex,not_removed,was this always the plan or is it more of a fuck it lets just see how many times we can get it to fly before it cracks
spacex,not_removed,i dont think elon means reflight of the same booster within hours more like the launch of another booster every hours say you have boosters so by the time the first one lands it gives them days to get back and get it ready again for the next launch meanwhile the second one launches then the third etc etc also theyve only got droneships someone add landing pads proving this hour turnaround reusability is key for mars
spacex,not_removed,that turnaround time record is going to be beat sooner or later
spacex,not_removed,with a rapid increase in launch cadence capacity at ksc will likely become an issue the boca chica site is not complete and is only licensed for launches per year where will space x turn for additional launch capacity
spacex,not_removed,just doing some rough calculations it hit me that today the cost of space could immediately be slashed except for the fact that if spacex wants to maintain its profit margins they cant do that without doubling their launch rate and then some beginning today and going forward the cost of space is actually no longer limited by the cost of the rocket especially with fairing reuse on the horizon but launch rate they can only lower the price so much and maintain their current profit margins i assume spacex would like to actually grow their profit so the only thing that can accomplish both goals is launch rate demand is the other limiting issue but i dont think thats going to be a problem at all once prices drop so really after today launch rates is whats going to be driving prices lower especially if they end up recovering fairings and eventually have a stage solution we could have stupid low prices but in order for spacex to maintain or even grow its profit margins they really do need something along the lines of per day and eventually launches per day or more at that rate prices will drop to ridiculous levels where it will make sense for a movie studio to consider filming their space scenes in spaceand it will only be a fraction of their budget no more expensive than hiring a team of cgi specialists to design and ray trace it crazy so elon makes complete sense that really is going to be more of a factor than even reusing the stage for now once they can get to a day and reusable fairings a reusable stage will be the block to further lowering prices to under million and increasing the launch rate to over a day now imagine what it will mean for humanity when you have just one company alone doing thousands and in a decade hundreds of thousands of rocket launches a year it will be cheap enough for just about any small company to send something in space for any silly reason
spacex,not_removed,how do they plan to bring ocisly in quick enough for reflight ocean travel with a massive rocket isnt going to speed up too much
spacex,not_removed,is hours enough time to let the new coat of white paint dry edit for the its they wont have time to repaint i guess its time to research high temperature resistant paints
spacex,not_removed,why does he need reflight within hours if you have a fleet of boosters you could spend a week refurbishinginspecting andstill launch every day
spacex,not_removed,i hope they make a video like the first landing one capture the moment on the floor and the launch team
spacex,not_removed,i love how he immediately raises the bar
spacex,not_removed,hours isnt much time the rocket lands then immediately the crew has to transport the vehicle safely to the launchpad give it a health check put a new load and refuel it might be too ambitious id say a week would make more sense
spacex,not_removed,is a hour turnaround even necessary they expect the to get flights before retirement that still means the mass majority of time will be making the rockets ultimately for customers a week turnaround is good enough the only reason i think a hour turnaround is a good idea is if spacex actually does their internet satellite array with literally hundreds of rockets each year they would need a hour turnaround
spacex,not_removed,the thing i noticed was that after the reentry burn the right hand grid fin appeared to heat to an orange glow and that it seemed to take some damage either paint was flaking and burning off of it or the aluminum was starting to come apart we have heard of grid fin damage before but the surprise was that the other grid fin in the picture seemed to take no damage at all
spacex,not_removed,the first time they do this my guess would be an rtls launch like a dragon followed by some of their own cheap internet sats lowest possible cost and risk
spacex,not_removed,everybodys talking about the rocket readiness but theres no range currently that could support that afaik boca chica
spacex,not_removed,now that reuselanding is getting highly likely to work and that they give a discount for using a used booster do you think they will start scrubing launches for weather at the landing sit to insure they get the booster back in once piece
spacex,not_removed,this is the true meaning of rapid reuse rebuilding a space vehicle is doable see sapce shuttle doing it cheaply is the hard part and spacex seems to have no problem working towards just that
spacex,not_removed,i think its more likely they will land on mars before they achieve a turnaround on a rocket
spacex,not_removed,how about the rocket flying off from a drone ship to return faster to the next launch site after a small refuelling
spacex,not_removed,shouldnt the next goal be improving their statistical reliability thats the most important aspect for manned flights and theyre behind schedule
spacex,not_removed,wait until he tells them that he meant tomorrow
spacex,not_removed,maybe im just super hyped up because of today mission but i believe this new goal will be achieved in less time
spacex,not_removed,except everyone at space x is like oh shit because he never told anyone it was the next goal
spacex,not_removed,you the same photog that does the excellent purdue work
spacex,not_removed,the next goal is just as crazy and i cant wait to see them achieve it exciting times ahead
spacex,not_removed,noob here whats fairing edit thanks for the answers
spacex,not_removed,there was a followup that they were not recovered just directed to a recovery area or something like that
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomsciguyspace the fairing was recovered this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,do they reuse the fairings
spacex,not_removed,im a bit slow on the implications of this does this mean fairings are now reusable or is it just a milestone on the way to making fairing reusable or is it just partial reusability
spacex,not_removed,i wonder what his time frame is for this not as a elon time joke but a sincere estimate
spacex,not_removed,the journey has only begun but it has definitely begun
spacex,not_removed,did you notice the were hiring ad on the hosted broadcast
spacex,not_removed,absolutely no way to turn around an asds landing in hours it takes several days to be towed into port so unless they start doing refuel and grasshopperonsteroids hops to the mainland after a barge landing these turnarounds will be for rtls landings
spacex,not_removed,pretty sure that the hour relaunch is only meant for land landings and not feasible for droneship landings
spacex,not_removed,most likely maybe a brief static fire burn and even thats questionable
spacex,not_removed,hours would definitely be no static fire thats only really enough time to bolt on a second stage and payload and roll it out to the pad
spacex,not_removed,go back to elons aircraft analogy aircraft arent thoroughly inspected between flights pilots do quick visual inspections modern aircraft are loaded with sensors and can flag issues in flight the has over sensors so id imagine at some point if not already spacex will be able to identify problems simply from data
spacex,not_removed,perhaps just a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwalkaround
spacex,not_removed,i dont see why it has to be the same rocket every hours just have a few of them being processed in parallel henry ford style and hours should be fine
spacex,not_removed,how do they plan on turning the pad around in less than hours
spacex,not_removed,i dont think the rocket needs to land on the pad there can be a landing zone directly besides and a crawler that brings it back on the pad and folds the legs to me thats what the roomba will become
spacex,not_removed,it might also imply a change in the way those deep inspections are done with more and more advanced sensors and diagnostic equipment the quality of an indepth manual inspection could be matched or surpassed with fast and automated methods the best of both worlds
spacex,not_removed,to get to leo or a bit above and a inorbit hydrolox pusher such as aces to move the payload into its final orbit before coming back to leo for the next one
spacex,not_removed,i would expect grid fin damage crush core damage in landing legs potentially soot buildup in engines and ablative cork on the octaweb just my speculation
spacex,not_removed,we dont know
spacex,not_removed,that will probably have to wait until block
spacex,not_removed,parts of the landing legs get exchanged that alone prevents immediate reuse oh and they dont have vertical integration of the stages the booster has to be connected with a new second stage horizontally
spacex,not_removed,that would be incredible i highly doubt it would happen but man it would be cool for a company to just claim a booster like that imagine how much pride they would take in that booster over time
spacex,not_removed,the booster from today wont be reflown again its slated to become a museum piece ses have asked to use parts from it to decorate their boardroom so i guess in a way they did call dibs
spacex,not_removed,it was never ses booster in the first place
spacex,not_removed,the industry sells you the launch service not the hardware this is because so far all of it would end up disintegrating in the atmosphere or the water somewhere maybe things will change now based on spacexs historic reuse of a booster
spacex,not_removed,for rapid reusability i expect theyll be wanting to land the rocket back on the pad
spacex,not_removed,if they get serious about launching internet satellites theyll have to do a lot of flights
spacex,not_removed,im basing this prediction on the ipt video its but yes youre probably right things need to be progressive though once falcon heavy is flying frequently asds landings will become less common and most launches will have rtls landings from there improvements can be made to land on the pads though id dare to say there needs to be some pad redesigns to make that possible
spacex,not_removed,i suspect that once the falcon heavy starts flying the drone ship landings will become less common missions that require a drone ship landing could be switched to an all core rtls falcon heavy
spacex,not_removed,no only with rtls with an asds landing it would be closer to days
spacex,not_removed,hypothetically they could probably refuel the rocket on the barge and launch it back to the launch site would probably take some changes to the legs and maybe some sort of launch pad on the drone ship intentionally launching toward a populated area would probably also be problematic in practice im sure he means from a land landing and its probably simpler to just wait for the drone ship to return to port and have extra stages from a warehouse while its en route another interesting question this brings up is if you have launches this often and youre landing at sea do you need to own several drone ships can you maybe maintain one drone ship permanently at sea to land on and just ship supplies in and rockets out on other ships
spacex,not_removed,i believe hes talking to hours for the refurbishing process so that wouldnt include the actual recovery operations
spacex,not_removed,im not even sure why it takes so long for the asds to return to port will the inclusion of the roomba speed up the process or is it really that far out from the coast
spacex,not_removed,rehab and relaunch on the ship
spacex,not_removed,probably not but thats not a problem for light payload missions that do rtls fast reuse would probably allow to sell those missions very cheaply
spacex,not_removed,years id say
spacex,not_removed,always the plan its always been about rapid reuseability theyve demonstrated the reuseability and now theyre going to work on the rapid
spacex,not_removed,someone add landing pads one with another under construction i believe i get what youre saying and it definitely makes sense but i think elon does actually mean reflight of the same booster in hours hes said things about wanting basically an its flight every hour so this doesnt seem out of question and theyve been pushing the a launch every weeks itinerary for a while now so it seems odd that hed just start pushing for something like this instead
spacex,not_removed,only needs to be brought down by
spacex,not_removed,bear in mind that there is nothing stopping spacex from requesting more frequent flights from boca chica once they have the throughput to justify it they only get per year right now but in a few short years they might double or triple that of course theres also no guarantee that request would get approved
spacex,not_removed,i think one of the biggest things slowing down turn around times is pad refurbishments post launch so that will be an area of focus once pad turn around time is down to hours i dont think the number of launch pads matters unless you want to launch more than two rockets a day or am i thinking about this wrong
spacex,not_removed,if launch rate is the primary driver of profit then that could mean spacex has to grow further downstream and create more of its own demand with businesses closer to endusers which would be sort of going in the reverse direction that tesla has starting with the consumer product and then growing upstream to the energy infrastructure with spacex theyve started with the launch infrastructure and may grow downstream to applications dragon is just one example and their internet satellite concept would be a major other one
spacex,not_removed,he probably means only for pad landings but how about refueling and relaunching from the droneship to hop back to land
spacex,not_removed,good thread of comments here about your very question
spacex,not_removed,i think its a mind set that talks more to how much refurbishment a rocket needs than actual core flight cadence there are pictures in the webcast showing all the engines out of the octoweb being inspected they say they took four months and then many questioned exactly how much was re used hours is clear land inspect clean and decoke replace easily serviceable parts designed as consumable and the begin mating the payload
spacex,not_removed,because time is money the reason airplane tickets are cheap are because airplanes tend to fly all the time with basically just refueling if a plane was inspected for weeks on end after every flight it would have been extremely expensive
spacex,not_removed,the rocket lands then immediately the crew has to transport the vehicle safely to the launchpad
spacex,not_removed,i remember hearing something about the stage landing on the barge refuelling there flying back to the launch pad refuelling there and launching again
spacex,not_removed,they actually intend to do their internet satellite array has elon ever announced something batshit crazy like that without going through with it
spacex,not_removed,discussed in press conference will change to a tougher material
spacex,not_removed,umso no testing the engine or accounting for the fact that the barge isnt stable
spacex,not_removed,theres no way they can get to hour turn around times without doing a shit ton of presumably successful flights they are not mutually exclusive
spacex,not_removed,less time than what
spacex,not_removed,to be more specific i think ten years would be the time they would need i might be wrong and probably underestimating time required but im sure im not overestimating
spacex,not_removed,reflight within hours has kind of always been the goal
spacex,not_removed,i like to think that i take nice photos of purdue probably
spacex,not_removed,their only options now will be to make the second stage reusable or to build a massive second stage factory
spacex,not_removed,uninformed question why does it take so long to make one exotic materials tight tolerances extensive testing
spacex,not_removed,everyone repeats this claim but the obvious response is to simply build multiple fairings in parallel its like saying the reason we reuse airplane is because the current airplane manufacturing capabilities couldnt keep up with needed production if we always threw planes away after each flight its trivially true but in that hypothetical world we invest in more plants to build more planes in parallel the real reason is as always that its cheaper to reuse right
spacex,not_removed,the fairing is the casing that surrounds the payload at the top of the rocket it basically shields the payload the satellite in this case from the effects of drag caused by going so fast in the atmosphere
spacex,not_removed,the big two part shell that encapsulate the satellite those are jettisoned to save weight when the rocket is out of atmosphere
spacex,not_removed,its the part of the rocket that splits in to deploy the payload on the nosecone is the fairing
spacex,not_removed,similar to the first controlled landing into the ocean to test the navigation etc
spacex,not_removed,they hope to
spacex,not_removed,almost certainly not reusable yet but a great milestone on the road to get them reusable
spacex,not_removed,i would put money on them hitting monthly turnaround by the block v flight or so weekly maybe a year after that daily idk im being super conservative with my guess but maybe i guess it depends on just how reusable block v is
spacex,not_removed,im really disappointed i want to be part of it but as a nonus citizen itar basically means i cant do anything with spacex
spacex,not_removed,im considering going back to school for this exact reason
spacex,not_removed,at one point it was planned for the rocket to refuel on the ship and then fly back to the launch site not sure if thats still on the table
spacex,not_removed,youre correct in that it cannot be in an asds because they are too slow perhaps they change to a ship as per the blue origin video
spacex,not_removed,i think theyll eventually transition away from static fires eventually
spacex,not_removed,maybe the hours are to the static fire burn
spacex,not_removed,and would only even be something you can consider on a return to launch site launch the drone takes days just to get back to port
spacex,not_removed,i always felt that walkarounds were a bit like looking at the skin of an apple to see if it was rotten inside better than nothing but by how much
spacex,not_removed,i think this turnaround thing is rather for demonstration than for actual business
spacex,not_removed,because a plane can fly again after it lands and refuels and thats what they are going for
spacex,not_removed,maybe launch from land truck it back to launch
spacex,not_removed,now thats an interesting theory test the attitude adjuster on the asds then roll it out as a transporter at as the pace picks up i wonder if there is any advantage to moving the stage vertically vs lowering it onto a truck for transport not entirely sure there is a suitable route to transport between the two sites while vertical either
spacex,not_removed,it helps that already has a crawlerway set up
spacex,not_removed,current legs are not reusable they need to change them after each landing
spacex,not_removed,ideally theyd do a quick inspection where they look for anything outoftheordinary or unacceptable to do this they must have a baseline for ordinary and acceptable so theyll need to do deep inspections to build up a database no reason to automate it instead get to a point where its not necessary
spacex,not_removed,the pusher has to slow from at least orbital velocity down to meco velocity then it must accelerate itself and the payload up to at least orbital velocity it must also handle the inclination change from its last job iirc the time of day adjustment is relatively trivial compared to the deltav for those first two challenges but all launches become instantaneous i suppose a fleet of pushers could both reduce the challenge of inclination adjustments you pick the most suitable and allow aerobraking or electric engine to do the slow down back to leo over a period refuelling from earth would be ridiculous the would need to lift x tonnes of fuel in a passive tank of which most would be burnt accelerating it and your pusher during fuel transfer ill leave the math to others but it will be bad refuelling from an icey asteroid or the moon may help things but we are deep into scifi now
spacex,not_removed,have new legs and fins ready to bolt on after landing have quick procedures to clean everything else up and a short idk about hours turnaround seems realistic to me assuming everything goes as expected and no core parts need replacement
spacex,not_removed,grid fin damage watching the grid fin burn was awesome to bad they pulled away from the feed i wonder why just that one heated up
spacex,not_removed,yeah during press conference elon mentioned that the aluminum grid fins start on fire they will forge them from titanium so they can be reused elon new design coming for grid fin will be largest titanium forging in the world current grid fin is aluminum and gets so hot it lights on fire which isnt good for reuse
spacex,not_removed,they dont need to replace the legs if they dont have legs i predict cradle landings on the droneship
spacex,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking this project is either a process engineers dream or a nightmare not sure which
spacex,not_removed,could they do it if they had the facilities to do it or would changes need to be made to the interstage area
spacex,not_removed,they took the risk so its fair enough realy
spacex,not_removed,you seem to be correct and i think the tool to this means is the falcon heavy a falcon asds payload is easily a triple core rtls for fh
spacex,not_removed,just put most of em on the bfr solved p
spacex,not_removed,so my guess is second stage will be preloaded so second stage will come back and land where ever and be refurbished meanwhile a prep second stage with cargo will be loaded on the the boater just like it is in the ipt video that is of course if you think reuse is even necessary
spacex,not_removed,thats basically a question of how many times a booster can be flown if the number is high it makes sense to move to fh if the number is low the wear and tear of flying cores might outweigh the cost of drone ship recovery
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if the in extra fuel costs for the two side boosters would be cheaper than the expenses associated with an asds recovery
spacex,not_removed,first one and then the other do what you cant
spacex,not_removed,because a barge can only be towed at knots
spacex,not_removed,is it really that far out from the coast km from their home port at cape canaveral less from port los angeles since it is well south of the launch site at vandenberg
spacex,not_removed,it was almost km away this time around i think goal is for the rtls scenario
spacex,not_removed,i dont think the legs can support the fuel needed and the ship doesnt have the water systems for protecting itself from a full launch
spacex,not_removed,that was considered and with a hour turnaround that would be an interesting option would stress the barge
spacex,not_removed,spacex can request permission to launch more frequently but theres no guarantee that it will be granted launching impacts the nearby community and theres already a lot of opposition to spacexs presence assuming spacex is granted permission for more launches im guessing it would construct multiple pads at boca chica to accommodate a mix of falcon heavy and falcon launches having multiple pads would enable spacex to launch from one while another is being made ready if block is able to be rapidly reused dozens of launches i envision a substantial increase in the companys launch pace just putting the proposed spacex satellite constellation in orbit would require hundreds of launches i think space x will need another launch location within the next months
spacex,not_removed,i dont know about nowadays but back during the space race it would take weeks to refurbish the launch pad this was actually a major challenge for the first manned rendezvous because they had to refurbish the pad quicker than the men ran out of air it was a real challenge to get it down from the then standard iirc weeks to just a week so the astronauts didnt spend too long up there remember this was back during like gemini before we had any long terms studies on the effects of space travel
spacex,not_removed,i dont think demand is going to be the issue at all you have to seriously consider what it would mean to have thousands of launches of rockets a year by one company within years and prices that will eventually reach sub million after stage and fairings reusability think about what that will do for a world economy demand is going to be ridiculous because of what those prices open up even if you dont think humanspace tourism is going to initially be a big factor it will kickstart the building of infrastructure in space tons at a time you are talking about offering significant payload and cheap enough prices to companies who could never afford it before or couldnt make a business case out of those prices and now they can it wont be just satellites demand will outstrip supply for a very long time as prices drop so it really will be launch rate for quite sometime being the barrier to lowering cost as well as spacexs goal for a maximum profit they will pocket most of the savings initially until competition arrives they are going to need more launch pads the us is going to need more launch pads and i mean a lot more launch pads
spacex,not_removed,im pretty sure something like this was a proposed idea early on in the design process
spacex,not_removed,also cant believe no one said it more barges just have one or two going out to sea all the time so you end up with one in the landing area every hours for the hour turn around
spacex,not_removed,no im pretty sure it was repainted
spacex,not_removed,wont happen logistically its just not plausible unfortunately would be cool yeah but not economically viable insert more economic arguments here
spacex,not_removed,well some things are still out and remain to be answered like will tesla or solar city ever make a profit hes doing pretty well selling rockets to companies but if he cant sell internet to the average user it does matter
spacex,not_removed,exactly maybe a barge wont do anymore but planes or helis take off from larger ships
spacex,not_removed,nah screw that they dont call it rapid for nothin s
spacex,not_removed,less time than going from a mariachi band in a small office to a reused first stage booster on an orbital launch system methinks
spacex,not_removed,theres also second stage reuse now back on the table we didnt plan for to have a reusable upper stage but it might be fun to try a hail mary anyways whats the worst that could happen it blows up elon
spacex,not_removed,will it require a static fire between flights though
spacex,not_removed,once he tweeted within single digit hours
spacex,not_removed,yeah i thought people knew that because the its clearly requires multiple spaceships and tanks to be launched to leo in a small mars window if we had to wait days for each its launch then it would be impossible to send an its fleet to mars
spacex,not_removed,big fan your work is fantastic hope you get all the lighthouses around lake michigan this year
spacex,not_removed,luckily both stages share a lot of manufacturing equipment i think if youre making fewer first stages you should be able to make more second stages
spacex,not_removed,they take weeks in an oven baking it is called a autoclave and curing though
spacex,not_removed,these fairings are about x theyre largely carbon fibre and on that scale its slow and labour intensive to manufacture youre right though serving as the leading edge of an orbital launch vehicle they are also made to tight tolerances and extensively tested
spacex,not_removed,someone described it as like building two boats that connect back to back
spacex,not_removed,the autoclaves used to make fairings is massive and takes up significant area in the manufacturing area
spacex,not_removed,how was it recovered parachutes
spacex,not_removed,this happens fairly soon after the second stage ignites
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomspacebrendan musk correction not recovered but it was directed to a landing area will have bouncy castle soon this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,there it is thanks
spacex,not_removed,wasnt the quickest turnaround for a space shuttle orbiter something like six months if they can make a one month turnaround time that would seem to indicate that reuse is ecnomically viable and that the game has changed
spacex,not_removed,if theyve not hit daily turnaround by theres probably something majorly wrong for starters theyll need daily reuse to deploy the internet constellation which seems to be pretty much a requirement for its to happen so by then they need to either have a rapidly reusable or fund its off investments and have it ready to start flying soon in which case reuse is a moot point
spacex,not_removed,yeah id say thats a good guess i think they may beat for a hour turnaround but it might be more of a marketing thing i dont think theyll have the demand to launch a few hundred rockets a year by then
spacex,not_removed,not sure how seriously to take hour turnaround it currently takes days just to get the booster back into port currently they can go from vertical to horizontal move to hangar replace a part then back out and vertical again in under hours they did this after a scrub for echostar xxiii so hours turnaround is only feasible for rtls lets assume elon means hours from when its back on land we can also reasonably assume that the rocket is self checking enough to spot any issues from the last flight and that detailed tests are scheduled as at present with aircraft so that means the operations are safe the craft transport to hangar inspect used stage and in parallel bolt on the new stage with cargo and fairing attached transport to pad go this seems feasible given the rapid turnaround of echostar xxiii
spacex,not_removed,elon musk said in post launch conference that they aim to do that next year turnaround
spacex,not_removed,same here mars here we come
spacex,not_removed,launch techs will be either required on mars or as dedicated ship crew
spacex,not_removed,im in getting a major in operation management but its my dream to work at spacex
spacex,not_removed,who in your country is making payloads find them
spacex,not_removed,emigrate elon did
spacex,not_removed,become a us person join your local space agency or start learning some botany so you can emigrate to mars
spacex,not_removed,if youre going for a technician position hands on experience is a much better route
spacex,not_removed,but replace also replace asds landings with triple core rtls landings only if spacex charges the same price which i cant see them doing with all the added risk and complications to save on an asds
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if the explosion last year would make them uneasy about additional unnecessary refuelings this is in addition to the fact that the landing legs would have to be redesigned currently once theyre out theyre stuck there
spacex,not_removed,given their phenomenal landing accuracy they certainly could make that landing area smaller they would always have to evacuate the ship before landing or keep it fully automatic
spacex,not_removed,yeah youre probably right the second hold before launch will probably be good enough
spacex,not_removed,i think his goal is to launch land and relaunch in hours
spacex,not_removed,yeah that makes sense i suppose unnecessary but very very cool
spacex,not_removed,i think its a conceptual thing even if its hr from asds coming back i think he means no refurb more than he cares whether they fly the same booster again hours later no doubt theyll do it to prove a point but theres no particular reason you cant have of them and fly each one on a day roster a launch cadence of a day would be ludicrous anyway
spacex,not_removed,and theyre doing vertical integration on maybe they can mate vertically
spacex,not_removed,but block v will be reusable
spacex,not_removed,it sounded like they meant no more gto launches only leo could easily rtls for current gto payloads if they only go to leo the trouble is making a financial case for an orbital tug to haul the sats from leo to geo
spacex,not_removed,developing reusable legs would almost be essential those cant be cheap
spacex,not_removed,probably all heated up but the plasma was more visible on that one since it was in the shadow of the booster
spacex,not_removed,i predict cradle landings on the droneship youre going to need a bigger droneship with a flame trench
spacex,not_removed,i dont know how long the integration takes but i would expect that it is a relevant part of hours
spacex,not_removed,but instead with satellites that would be awesome
spacex,not_removed,meh yeah you could fit a ton on bfr but your inclination for a lot of them would be out of wack much easier to launch or so into the same inclination of fh turn around and do it again the next day for another inclination
spacex,not_removed,thats fine i just dont see that the second stage being integrated with the first stage with the current design in under days
spacex,not_removed,musk design intent is that rocket can be reflown with zero hybrid changes times then with moderate refurb times we can make it but theres no point in that its will be reflights obviously hybrid is a typo should be hardware
spacex,not_removed,why not both if manufacturing and turn around times for rtls and fh cores stay up then they can afford the occasional asds mission
spacex,not_removed,also keep in mind that the reentry stresses for all three fh boosters will be much lower than what the did today rtls profiles slow the stage down significantly before reentry due to the boostback burn it might be more cost effective in the long run in terms of refurbishment costs
spacex,not_removed,thats a good point who operates the droneship shepherd whats the expenses for that
spacex,not_removed,a barge can only be towed at knots or a barge carrying a rocket can only be towed at knots edit is this a general restriction for everyone or just a safety thing spacex does
spacex,not_removed,hm so whats the work around will block be able to rtls more often than ft
spacex,not_removed,clearly some regulations need to change unless this is a technical limit
spacex,not_removed,maybe the clock starts when the droneship returns to port for asds landings then edit happy cakeday uneedonlypositive
spacex,not_removed,however if they developed a ship with a built in strongback and fueling system they could theoretically have an ocean launchpad but obviously this would be many years away if its even possible
spacex,not_removed,this is actually very interesting thank you ive read a lot about the daring mercury missions and the amazing apollo missions but not much on the gemini missions theyre like the forgotten middle child of americas space programs
spacex,not_removed,i think the idea is that once falcon heavy starts regularly flying payloads requiring a asds landing will instead be loaded onto a fh
spacex,not_removed,please look up pictures before stating that you are pretty sure because it certainly
spacex,not_removed,it looked like it was sprayed down but it certainly was not repainted
spacex,not_removed,tesla turned a profit with just the model once the model starts shipping they should be earning hand over fist and selling the space internet to users wont be a problem even ignoring the massive demand in developing nations there are plenty of people locked in with one option they dont like century link thatll jump at the opportunity and thats even ignoring the hyperreal factors like musks personality cult and space dreamers
spacex,not_removed,next milestone modified cargo plane catches rocket mid air delivers back to launch pad
spacex,not_removed,exactly probably should have explained myself a little better
spacex,not_removed,the last flight was the static fire
spacex,not_removed,good question but i see no reason static fire and launch cant be accomplished on the same day aside from red tape that is
spacex,not_removed,thank you very much spring break and seeing all of those in days was incredible look forward to more of it this summer i will get them all
spacex,not_removed,they said the first stage is most of the cost so id say between and
spacex,not_removed,so expand the manufacturing area or build them somewhere else or buy them from a party etc etc the boeing construction plant takes up significant room but this doesnt mean they couldnt increase plane manufacturing capacity
spacex,not_removed,word is the parachute is steerable and the thrusters are similar to or the same as the rsc cold gas thrusters used on for reentry
spacex,not_removed,three months that was a special case were they reflew the same mission with the same crew after the first mission was cut short
spacex,not_removed,technically spacex already achieved a month turnaround it just took more months before they could fly it caused many delays and ses was the first to step up and be willing to fly a used booster they still had to wait their turn in the schedule to launch no line cutting just because you are willing to fly used
spacex,not_removed,why does it need to be daily for the internet constellation i thought they can get it up and running with just a few hundred satellites and multiple satellites can be launched at a time
spacex,not_removed,hopefully
spacex,not_removed,spacex wants to launch its own satellites into leo theyre planning to be their own market
spacex,not_removed,the demand might be from themselves keep in mind the spacex seattle division is working on setting up their satellite constellation for leo internet satellites only in the design stages atm as far as i know
spacex,not_removed,people here often forget that spacex is not the only company doing cool stuff in space
spacex,not_removed,generally you need a nonaerospace job in the us first to be able to do that
spacex,not_removed,yeah im thinking avionics or ap school because i have no aerospace experience currently first im going to apply to a bunch of entrylevel positions because i would rather not spend thousands of dollars if i dont have to i figure if i start a low level position i can work my way up and then eventually make it over to spacex or another awesome company
spacex,not_removed,if all the stages are reused anyway the only expendable parts are the second stage and fairing and both falcon and falcon heavy are the same there so in principle the costs shouldnt be that much greater for the falcon heavy obviously this depends on refurbishment being at least cheaper than barge usage but when you factor in the ratelimiting effect of the barge it may be worth it
spacex,not_removed,the landing legs are already being redesigned for reusability in block
spacex,not_removed,also if youre doing hour turnaround the previous launch should count as static fire
spacex,not_removed,hence i said current
spacex,not_removed,theyre reusable you just need to
spacex,not_removed,some hydraulic legs compared to a space rocket eh seems pretty cheap to me
spacex,not_removed,in another thread someone said its because at that point they use the rocket as a lifting body so the earthside fins are getting atmosphered and the fins on the other side are in the lee
spacex,not_removed,to land why
spacex,not_removed,you make a really good point here i have always assumedand i have little engineering knowledge that the second stage heat shield would be replaced each flight i imagine i large machine that can simply pull off the old shield and slap on a new one unfortunately spacex has not mentioned stage in years but i expect they will make an announcement this year after falcon heavy flys
spacex,not_removed,i get fucking chills reading its will be reflights good god almighty man thats just ahhh what reflights
spacex,not_removed,one its can bring people to orbit and they cost less than the apollo program
spacex,not_removed,good point just watching the grid fin nearly melt in todays landing left me quite nervous because thats some incredible stresses involved on the rocket
spacex,not_removed,they tow out at around knots for the first part of the return tow while they are securing the booster they seem to tow at around knots into the prevailing waves to minimise roll and then they tow home at about knots but sometimes slower most likely due to sea conditions
spacex,not_removed,i will say the latter as i dont know for certain the answer to the former
spacex,not_removed,no is mainly improvements around reusability the workaround will be using falcon heavy
spacex,not_removed,falcon heavy is the workaround
spacex,not_removed,the tow maxes out at but causes less waves and turbulence so they go at you have to remember the barge is the size of a football field
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,and very expensive it would literally be a floating launch pad and they would need crew to restow the legs for strongback use its much easier to just buy a bigger boat that can cut through the waves better and maybe even have a couple landing pads one fore and one aft so they can land multiple rockets on a single trip out
spacex,not_removed,not necessarily maybe spacex could refurbish the ocean oddesy
spacex,not_removed,i learned all about the us space program from when we left earth the nasa missions its a fascinating series discovery put out almost a decade ago it covers damn near everything that actually happened in chronological order
spacex,not_removed,nah we got ya
spacex,not_removed,i dont see why it has to be one or the other
spacex,not_removed,the second stage could be improved but falcon heavy is able to compensate for the most part as spacex transitions to reuse and increases the launch rate so they can better amortize their capital expenses and overhead the expended upper stage will become a significant perlaunch expense the upper stage could become the limiting factor in launch rate their factory has limited capacity and it would be very expensive to expand move or build an additional factory fairing reuse is valuable for the same reason a reusable will take a significant performance hit but spacex can shift more missions to the heavy a launch on a fullyreusable heavy could be cheaper than a with expendable upper stage eventually the raptor upgrade would provide an incremental improvement
spacex,not_removed,in order to add recovery equipment to without drastically reducing the payload capacity of the rocket i think youd need to use a raptor engine my question is whats the weightsize comparisons between a merline and a raptor
spacex,not_removed,the problem with the raptor is they would then need to be setup to handle three propellants at the pad and in the strong arm lox and with the latter two being at cryogenic temperatures yes this isnt completely new but it would mean a plumbing system within the strongback
spacex,not_removed,i figured that using two different sets of engines and fuel types and construction materials would increase complexity to a point where throwing away spent stages is cheaper but i lack the engineering expertiese to back this hypothesis up id also like to see more development production of the raptor engine but i dont see the falcon system as the platform of choice
spacex,not_removed,if they develop a new second stage with a raptor engine carbon fiber tanks secondary spherical tank and refueling lines then they can do inorbit refueling secondstagetosecondstage and make second stage be able to support long term missions while at the same time testing a lot of technologies for its adding the option to land that second stage would be a natural extension of that approach basically imagine a new second stage that is in fact a miniits
spacex,not_removed,throw money this isnt nasa they just bolt on new parts and try it they dont spend years and salaries studing and waste money
spacex,not_removed,it might be a challenge to assemble the stages and payload together in hours
spacex,not_removed,they can only launch at most about satellites at a time on falcon limited by fairing volume and they need to replace the entire sat constellation every years because the satellites are designed with a very short lifetime thats launches a year just for their internet sats alone an incomplete constellation isnt going to give them the billions in revenue they need so only sending up a few hundred and waiting years for full deployment doesnt help
spacex,not_removed,they might need close to daily launches but that doesnt imply turnaround time on a single booster if they have a set of and a one week turnaround they can cycle them out
spacex,not_removed,the orbits are so low that it takes thousands to achieve coverage and if the internet works most of the time thats not good enough daily might be a stretch i dont see how they could keep up with production but they need a lot of launches
spacex,not_removed,thats a good point i wasnt even thinking about that
spacex,not_removed,once were launching two in a window it shouldnt be much extra work to add a tether system to spin them producing artificial gravity during the voyage
spacex,not_removed,well yeah but they are the coolest
spacex,not_removed,def apply to an entry level position very little of what youll learn there can be taught at school for technicians they look for hands on experience in just about any field that shows your competency and ability to learn
spacex,not_removed,boostbackhover slam is the static fire to test after the main burn failing the booster return is a cheap failure scenario comparatively speaking
spacex,not_removed,but he wasnt talking currentso
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomelonmusk dfjsteve very similar the crush core in the falcon legs is reusable after soft landings but needs to be replaced after hard this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,to be fair theyre like feet long each and made of carbon fiber
spacex,not_removed,to deflect the rocket exhuast away from the cradle
spacex,not_removed,i was just talking about the current disposable second stage i dont know how long it currently takes them to assemble the two parts vs install the fiddly bits like grid fins legs etc but it seems like it takes a couple days currently on the topic of a reusable second stage having seen their original animation for the rocket a pica shield like on and is likely as it is lightweight and can be reused in theory several times before refurbishingreplacing not sure the rest of the plan but if they can decelerate enough then maybe a steerable parachute could bring it to the pad after an orbit
spacex,not_removed,until today elon expressed interest in the post flight presser
spacex,not_removed,well block v will still have a substantial performance increase compared to the block that said its hard to say what that is id say a safe bet is a performance increase that will definitely allow for more launches to rtls but i imagine missions similar to these will still probably land on a barge although with much greater margins a softer decent and a single engine burn
spacex,not_removed,my bad i thought also had a slightly higher lift capacity
spacex,not_removed,wont at least one stage of fh have to land on the asds
spacex,not_removed,in this case they will need to launch on something that can move faster
spacex,not_removed,launching from a sea vessel has been done before
spacex,not_removed,doesnt have to be no just seems like if youre gonna spend x dollars seems to make sense to upgrade your capabilities as the second stage is the weakest spot of the and fh reusing the stage with the existing merlin engine would require a significant mass penalty and reduces the payload you can carry thats doesnt make sense
spacex,not_removed,if its for fuel its million for falcon heavy fuel if they did full reuse on and fh it would be super cost effective to fly heavy when it made the difference between tossing the second stage and not
spacex,not_removed,it might be interesting to leave the second stage in orbit as a resource rendezvous with it capture to construct onorbit transports the mission knowledge gained could be quite valuable
spacex,not_removed,raptor isnt much bigger than merlin it runs at a higher pressure though so the thrust is greater
spacex,not_removed,you would need a raptor for the isp efficiency they could probably manage a recovery on the demo flight with a small payload with the merlin but for a commercial mission you would need a raptor to have any significant payload to orbit
spacex,not_removed,yes throw money its also not nasa bolting on a new part still requires engineering hours simulation testing it will cost many millions of dollars to just bolt something on and try it
spacex,not_removed,i honestly dont have any idea what goes into that would be curious to learn more about it to see where the biggest bottlenecks in time would occur
spacex,not_removed,it does have potential to be a bottleneck the good thing about that is the production lanes for first stages can be gradually shifted to produce more second stages instead their facility has limits but that one shift can carry them pretty far
spacex,not_removed,how big are the satellites supposed to be i thought i read on this sub that closer to could launch on a falcon
spacex,not_removed,spacex has previously stated that they would develop a larger fairing if there was a customer wanting to pay for it to me it looks like that customer is going to be the spacex satellite division from a mass standpoint a single reusable falcon could launch about satellites the main leo constellation will only consist of satellites so with an approximate lifespan of five years that means launches per year when the vleo constellation is added to the mix that would be another satellites but these would be smaller satellites assuming they end up about half the mass they would need an additional launches per year for a total of just over launches per year however i dont think the vleo constellation would be necessary to fund its development to fund actually colonizing mars sure but not before the first few missions in the so for the timeline you outline a launch per week half internal half for customers should be more than enough
spacex,not_removed,so six times a year is the same as daily s i think what you will see is that the first launch will contain ten or so satellite and will be up for four or five months before another launch if the first group doesnt have problems then launches will take place once every week or two until they get the constellation to a basically functional state then launches slow down with launches occurring as they need to add capacity due to increasing subscribers
spacex,not_removed,good to know i applied to a couple i think its a bit of a longshot but we will see what happens i have technology experience especially with troubleshooting electronics but not in aerospace or manufacturing
spacex,not_removed,landing burns only use one to three engines so thats not a perfect test also itd put a significant dent in launch cadence if a failed landing obliterates a landing pad i doubt spacex will ever be comfortable with sacrificing reliability for turnaround time
spacex,not_removed,feet long try meters those things are absolutely massive
spacex,not_removed,landings do have or sometimes the exhaust to deal with though it shouldnt be too hard to build something catamaran style
spacex,not_removed,well block v will still have a substantial performance increase compared to the block that said its hard to say what that is id say a safe bet is a performance increase i could have missed something but that is the first ive heard of it edit block will have an extra thrust
spacex,not_removed,my bad i thought also had a slightly higher lift capacity it does but only very slightly block iii has a reusable gto capacity of about mg successful attempted but landed hard not even attempted while block v is httpwwwspacexcomaboutcapabilities to do mg
spacex,not_removed,in some cases but not all the stage in question would be the centre core
spacex,not_removed,rtls with all cores should still give a higher payload than with a drone ship landing but not much only worth the effort if core reuse is really easy
spacex,not_removed,not if its launching a payload that would require a falcon to land on a barge thatll only be a small fraction of the falcon heavys maximum payload
spacex,not_removed,for a rocket this size and for cheaper than a land pad
spacex,not_removed,i was thinking the same about the carbon fiber technology but they do already have the dev tank or had still waiting to hear about what happened to the dev tank
spacex,not_removed,agreed an upgrade stage would be the best possible test bed for at least some its technologies following in the successful spacex tradition of developing and testing new technologies as secondary and tertiary objectives of missions where the primary objective is paid for by customers carbon fiber tanks raptor engine autogenous pressurization get rid of those pesky copvs largerlighter heat shield increased endurance direct to gso anything else i would not be entirely surprised if this is part of the new timeline for developing its assuming a single scaled raptor cant be throttled low enough to land a nearlyempty vertically how many superdracos would it take to do the landing and how much would they weigh
spacex,not_removed,yeah thats a fair assessment last i remember seeing the stage recovery ideas were requiring heat shielding of some kind which will definitely add to the mass
spacex,not_removed,its not only fuel if a booster costs you million to make and you can launch it times then a booster launch is worth million
spacex,not_removed,if there were a customer for the materials it might make sense but then theres the problem of matching the orbits many of the upper stages would require significant inclination changes in order to meet up with the construction site my idea is to replace the second stage with eg a bolttogether geodesic tube so it can be dismantled in orbit and directly reused as building materials perhaps it carries a small payload or perhaps its payload is itself launch these to the orbital construction location
spacex,not_removed,no its doesnt cost that much in spacex and the engineers are there to do exactly that and get paid even if they dont it think elon knows what he is doing but thanks
spacex,not_removed,repainting the booster so it doesnt look like youre trying to relaunch a scorched hunk of space junk
spacex,not_removed,there would be plenty of room for tanks and other structure as the lines unwind but id start to wonder about how fast they can crank out mvac engines
spacex,not_removed,good luck
spacex,not_removed,also itd put a significant dent in launch cadence if a failed landing obliterates a landing pad i assume that if the boostback succeeds the engines are healthy
spacex,not_removed,hah not quite seen them in person probably more like feet if were trying to be realistic
spacex,not_removed,confirmation yeah and thats just the thrust theyre talking about with the they said there will be over small changes to block v theyre a combination of increasing reusability and increasing performance itll be interesting to see what they do
spacex,not_removed,well elon said they are going up to lb of thrust but its never to my knowledge been clear if that wont come until block v or if they are making those changes as fast as possible to the current fleet
spacex,not_removed,interestingly then you might end up with a ratio of side to center cores other than maybe youd refly the side boosters another time or two with a new core while the original core was on its way back in youd probably end up with a few extra cores in that case makes me wonder if they might one day in the distant future be open to flying a heavy core on its own if you have payloads that easily allow for rtls the extra performance hit of the weight of a heavy core might not matter and if youve got a few spare heavy cores lying around why not certification problems just a thought
spacex,not_removed,in that case it seems like there would be greater cost saving in loading fh with multiple satellites similar to iridium next to put it right at full rtls threshold
spacex,not_removed,for a rocket this size yes zenit cheaper than a land pad probably not but it wasnt extremely expensive either
spacex,not_removed,i read somewhere on reddit that it burst
spacex,not_removed,we seem to be on the same page this is exciting with elons new tweets about second stage recovery on the falcon heavy it has me hopeful that youre correct about the its news
spacex,not_removed,true but he said times for at least part of it so its still around million not terrible
spacex,not_removed,between refurbishments if it costs to refurbish and get another youre looking at more like per launchfuel even at it would be a lot less than the cost of an upper stage
spacex,not_removed,yes it absolutely categorically without a single ounce of doubt does nasa would charge million to try it out spacex will require million easy to prototype a recoverable stage probably more im not saying elon doesnt know what hes doing but you are correct in thinking it wont cost millions to have a prototype attempt to recover a stage you are wrong i am an aerospace systems engineer i know a little bit of what im talking about
spacex,not_removed,they didnt repaint this one they just washed it down there are pics showing it noticeably grey
spacex,not_removed,im pretty sure the paint has protective qualities maybe ablative or something its not just a question of aesthetics i wouldnt think
spacex,not_removed,except that they only wash the booster
spacex,not_removed,your estimate is that those legs are about adults long my estimate differs d
spacex,not_removed,at least based on human scale
spacex,not_removed,really the diameter of the rocket is m and the legs appear to be a hair under rocketdiameters in length i think m is a very good number for the leg length am i missing something
spacex,not_removed,the landing legs
spacex,not_removed,they have said will include more durable legs that wont need to be discarded elon confirmed today new grid fins theres the new octaweb construction and new copv design turbopump improvements beyond that they will likely be the small improvements and tweaks they routinely dont make public
spacex,not_removed,eol for heavy cores could be an expendable launch it might not matter then whether it goes up as the center core or alone
spacex,not_removed,the center cores are likely more expensive and more custom to manufacture than the regular side sticks i feel like the center cores will be kept in reserve just for heavy launches and the side sticks will be used for all launches eol for center cores would be the only time i think it would be useful to single fire one and even then it will probably be stripped of any useful hardware first
spacex,not_removed,so the ship was originally in the but i cant find info on the conversion costs launches and boeing apparently has nearly a billion in debt from it
spacex,not_removed,when are we supposed to get this its news i havent heard the rumors im of the mind set that the problem if there was one was one they knew of before testing and should be easily fixed this whole project depends on the structural stability of the tankairframe so i doubt its a show stopper
spacex,not_removed,me too and his line about not wanting to wait until we all die or spacex goes broke is making me worry they might scale down the vision and redesign the rocket now i always thought a person ship as a first attempt was a bit overkill even though i get the economics of it long term but a huge financial risk that could jeopardize the its itself due to rd costs and operational costs before reaping the rewards and before it got to the point of it becoming economically feasible and profitable that would happen if there was an actual city or base on mars capable of supporting that many people but reality says its going to take quite some time before that happens so i dont see hundreds of people flying to mars on each ship in the first few years so while the rational side of me supports any changes in plans that would make landing a small number of humans on mars more economically feasible the fan side of me would be disappointed if that rocket is any less grand and massive than what was originally proposed
spacex,not_removed,i am not going to argue with you about something that you think spacex would need to spend to get something done its ridiculous you have no clue they add systems in days they fab parts in hours on their cncs they have one of the best gpu sim code systems of any aerospace firm because they wrote it dont play the i am an aerospace engineer game i have deployed product and assisted many others to do it if you havent done it cheaply then it only shows your failing not your knowledge
spacex,not_removed,its mostly a heat issue launching at night it wouldnt matter much but it wouldnt be a big problem just build a rocket wash building like blue origin has planned
spacex,not_removed,as i said above at least feet not though
spacex,not_removed,but dont the side sticks have to undergo conversion to be used for single launches not exactly fitting with rapid turn around
spacex,not_removed,we dont really know much just that musk said thered be an update on the spacex site in a month
spacex,not_removed,with all the bfrcommercial crew news recently i think a lot of us have forgotten about spacexs satellite internet plans the first test satellites being launched into a km circular orbit at ° inclination have appeared to have received fcc approval and must be launched by aug by uthebloreo covers a lot of the information that we know about the constellation as well as a good bit of speculation anyways just thought the community might be interested in an update about another cool thing spacex is up to
spacex,not_removed,im kind of curious why a degree orbit i understand that some sort of polar orbit is needed but it seems like a less inclined orbit say degrees would still pass over essentially all occupied parts of earth while spending or wasting less time over the uninhabited polar regions and so would be more efficient or more generally does anybody know how that inclination was chosen instead of say degrees
spacex,not_removed,why does it have to launch by aug is it because the permit will have expired by then

spacex,not_removed,between being both an avid hiker and a comcast subscriber i cannot forget about the satellite plans if not spacex then someone cheap access to space may finally break the telcos or theyll just buy out sky too sigh
spacex,not_removed,i dont know but im guessing that the moons gravitational influence might be a factor and possibly the availability of sunlight
spacex,not_removed,not sure either but a lot of population density is northsouth along ocean coastlines so i may be better to have an orbit that provides denser coverage over the pacific rim and westeast coasts of north america
spacex,not_removed,what does steam even stand for spacex telecommunications
spacex,not_removed,httpspacenewscomsignsofsatelliteinternetgoldrush it is likely that steam refers to
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,thankfully spacex isnt the only one trying to make it happen among the other constellations are oneweb who has already signed agreements with arianespace rarianespace and virgin galactic rvirgingalactic to launch their satellite internet constellation additionally ive heard about vaguely facebooks intentions to provide internet with solar powered drone aircraft and their purchase of satellite capacity onboard amos i think ive also heard plans for a chinese satellite internet constellation but i could be mistaken long story short there are a lot of possible options so hopefully at least one will work out
spacex,not_removed,cheap access to space will help the telcos theyll be able to provide improved service to remote areas by routing through the satellites instead of having to link them up by laying expensive highbandwidth cables through regions with no population
spacex,not_removed,that could also reduce handoffs i imagine
spacex,not_removed,for those who dont want to google it httpspaceskyrocketdedocsdatiridiumnexthtm
spacex,not_removed,there are a lot of possible options so hopefully at least one will work out the bigger interesting point for me is that there is such a huge market that all of them could work out and still not satisfy demand the only hurdles here are technical ones not economical it would be amazing if oneweb and spacex constellations operate in parallel true global competition in the market would be wonderful
spacex,not_removed,all of them could work out and still not satisfy demand this is an important point there is one single project the ska that is rolling out that by itself will double the current internet data requirement we need every single new source of capacity possible just to handle the data the ska will generate
spacex,not_removed,link for the curious
spacex,not_removed,cant they use a wired fiber connection
spacex,not_removed,sure httpwwwskagovaupagesdefaultaspx
spacex,not_removed,the telescope itself spans over km the initial data collections points two of them are km from the nearest part of the telescope the main processing centre is on the opposite side of the planet with secondary processing centres on continents the volume of data per day is the same as all the current data per day in the internet
spacex,not_removed,thats incredible if theyre already building it how are they planning to solve that difficulty cant they just lay a fiber across those long distances surely it would be expensive but not nearly as much as the whole project
spacex,not_removed,oh on another point back when they first started doing the backoftheenvelope work on this in the early they identified a number of issues the ska works by measuring the minute time differences between reception at millions of different points on the telescope time and therefore data transfer speed is utterly critical so they invented something that would solve that data speed issue you and i know that invention as wifi
spacex,not_removed,speed there is a reason musk is building a space internet this project wont work without it and the data transfer capacity is the least of the issues the real issue is data processing we dont have the current computing power to handle it its why ska member canada is pushing so hard on quantum computing ska wont work without that either the ska is a moonshot project its the biggest science experiment ever built
spacex,not_removed,wouldnt a wired connection with more reliably than wifi over any range that wifi can cover how would that work over hundreds of kilometers
spacex,not_removed,there are local hubs within the network of antennae each individual telescope is actually a cluster of hundreds of small antennae in a very tight area
spacex,not_removed,here are charts of the fh demo flight planned dates in the last years first is the dates second is the remaining months and third is both in one chart httpimgurcomamhtvm here is the raw data and sources
spacex,not_removed,that is less than six months have we ever been closer than six months
spacex,not_removed,new tweet
spacex,not_removed,i am feeling really confident about anyone who wants to bet against me
spacex,not_removed,interesting that we hear a date for but not the demo flight
spacex,not_removed,so we think jan for fh what is the spacex time dilation turn into these days all joking aside that thing is going to be really impressive when it finally makes it to the launch pad im not sure if there will be a more iconic image then two side boosters separating and rtl

spacex,not_removed,so its been for over months and now its net sep the last day of i still consider that an encouraging sign because a specific date has more solidity than a quarter and if it does slip the slip can be in days rather than quarters also government fiscal year ends at the end of september it would be nice if they can make that date for the government customers though probably not a big problem if it slips a little more
spacex,not_removed,ill start to believe it when they announce a payload and a target orbit and no sooner
spacex,not_removed,do we have even the faintest idea what the demo flight payload will be assuming its not tonnes of cheese what could spacex provide as their own payload something small on an earth escape trajectory could have a better pr value than a huge block of ballast into leo theyve had plenty of time to work on a small secret project so some custom hardware could be possible but i doubt its anything sophisticated if so
spacex,not_removed,i bet that the demo flight wont be at least until fall in one year or so or maybe spring next year i hope to be wrong and they wont be delayed so much but knowing how spacex is with this fh thing
spacex,not_removed,could be confirmation bias here but those dots are getting closer together even if were always months away™ spacex is becoming increasingly confident in their ability to pull this off soon
spacex,not_removed,do we know if the comsic sat is a polar or a geo satellite constellation it would pretty cool to see a falcon heavy launch at vandenberg afb edit it looks like it will be launching out of vandenberg
spacex,not_removed,fh demo flight planned for net sep how can it be both second quarter and no earlier than sept which would be during
spacex,not_removed,i wonder what the opportunities are to do partial test flights with same fh you could enable a shutdown separation and landing if certain parameters leave thresholds thereby allowing the vehicle to be saved for study and retesting it might require adding the ability to relight all engines rather than just those needed for nominal landing
spacex,not_removed,whats the point of publishing what spacex says on this its never right theyve given dozens of dates at this point and weve passed pretty much all of them
spacex,not_removed,at some point in time they are going to need to launch the heavy im assuming they can do this before the heat death of the universe i think is going to be the year they have a lot to do before the end of but they are starting to crank out some hardware now
spacex,not_removed,i dont get why this sub is so backward on the launch dates satellite gets pegged for a falcon heavy flight falcon gets an upgrade satellite now can fly on a falcon falcon is cheaper urgency for falcon heavy is reduced falcon heavy development is delayed due to lack of customers and having to incorporate falcon changes into falcon heavy repeat for next satellite that requires falcon heavy yes they are missing deadlines but they are no customers and as company that optimises for cost they are not going to launch a falcon heavy with no customers following however since we have the final version of the falcon and a mars mission coming up then there is no more need for this cycle so therefore the dates are unlikely to change i know we all want to see it fly but it hasnt made financial sense til now however it feels like everyone this thumbing their nose every time their own product cannibalises their own product
spacex,not_removed,could you also graph the performance improvements of and fh over the years states that way back in fh had a rating of kg to leo
spacex,not_removed,so what do those trend lines zero in on
spacex,not_removed,i hope elon stumbles upon this i think he would get a kick out of it great job on the data acquisition
spacex,not_removed,why is mostly a step function used but at four occasions a linear interpolation between points
spacex,not_removed,beautiful data thanks for sharing fh schedule slips contain hints of spacex businessoperational model spacex is basically operating in startup mode and just starting to become a mature company development is an indicator of their haphazard approach to the development after years of existence spacex owns many great achievements that would make any company proud what they fail to do is to secure their business currently they have solid merlin engine that never failed dragon that failed once by not deploying parachutes during rud and number of experimental technologies like raptor engine dragon first stage landing and its related has a promise of becoming their workhorse or bread and butter winner thet promise will realize when they freeze its development and hand it over to the commercial operations deepartmentcode the first mandate of code department would be to religiously protect from any design changes and freezing documentation on any aspect of utilization including manufacturing storage fueling transportation refurbishment and operation the moment they achieve that spacex can go and modify next version of which would be maybe any failure of will not affect commercial operations due to heroic attempts of code department to keep engineers away from when they have successfully freeze development without retiring it then they can move to fh and in my humble opinion that would not happen this year
spacex,not_removed,is used to speculate and whereas reading the article i only see sept the article says the most recent previous estimate which is correctly cited in the doc as the estimate made on doc also has cites the article even though the article says it is on as saying but this just is referencing a timetable from jan that says there seems to be a lot of incorrect data in the table
spacex,not_removed,according to this data fh starts
spacex,not_removed,heres another data point note that this is for the falcon heavy
spacex,not_removed,yep the date once came dangerously close months but they handled the situation and rescheduled it
spacex,not_removed,weve broken the barrier im guessing they havent set a date yet as they are focusing intently on customer launches first and foremost
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomjefffoust noaas lidia cucurull said launch date to be confirmed by air force and noaa hopefully we will not have more slips this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,ill take it still too little heard about flightready hardware to convince me
spacex,not_removed,big spacex fan ill take any bet against an official date given by spacex
spacex,not_removed,not a betting man but i agree it might barely slip to due to last minute issues weather pad gremlins feeding cores but i expect it will be up on the pad in pending all other missions going off without a hitch of course
spacex,not_removed,makes sense though as has customers who are being briefed while the demo flight is solely spacex as far as we know
spacex,not_removed,even accounting for elon time fh demo should be within
spacex,not_removed,that is the first customer mission the demo flight is so anytime between april and june for the demo and september for the first customer flight on fh
spacex,not_removed,ill start to believe it at
spacex,not_removed,could send a load of water to leo and sell it to ula at a ton but i think it would be way cooler to send something on a lunar free return trajectory like say a dragon loaded with a few tons of cheese
spacex,not_removed,red dragon in a planetary protection fairing maybe land it on the moon if the launch actually works open the door and punt a wheel of cheese out to the linar surface
spacex,not_removed,it would be exited if got orbit then did experimental propulsive landing fh demo may be the only chance to try that before red dragon
spacex,not_removed,i dunno why everyone is talking about leo the fh demo is to gto one of the main purposes of the demo is to prove they can launch huge comm spy sats
spacex,not_removed,the ballast is by far most likely you dont want anything cluttering up your nroetc certification flight
spacex,not_removed,spring next year is red dragon time with a launch window that cant slip without pushing mars plans by two years i think we will see a properly motivated spacex to not let slip that close
spacex,not_removed,per your own link launch is lowinclination so florida launch is highinclination so maybe vandy
spacex,not_removed,unlikely in the source you mentioned due to the success of us agencies and taiwan have decided to move forward with a followon ro mission called that will launch six satellites into lowinclination orbits in and another six satellites into highinclination orbits in six satellites into lowinclination orbits in would correspond to
spacex,not_removed,degrees km
spacex,not_removed,is the first mission after demo flight
spacex,not_removed,hah i did the same thing commas are important and also important to notice them when reading
spacex,not_removed,but they can already recover all three cores no need to do a partial flight to recover all the hardware maybe youre thinking of the second stage but then you couldnt land the center core with the second stage attached
spacex,not_removed,well one of them has to hold eventually
spacex,not_removed,its fun to speculate thats why were here
spacex,not_removed,problem here is that any kind of rud with the fh probably grounds their entire fleet do they take the leap of faith and launch fh knowing if it succeeds it will open up a great revenue stream do they do this knowing is hopefully going to be a reliable money maker in and risk that with fh
spacex,not_removed,they wont have to ever launch it if they can get its flying theyve delayed it years already whats another between friends
spacex,not_removed,my guess is because this sub is heavily populated by fans of cool space hardware rather than space accountants a lot of people want to see falcon heavy fly just for the joy of it it will be the most powerful rocket in the world at the moment its side boosters will do an amazing synchronised landing and it is the critical path for exciting but less commercial missions like red dragon and the always hypothetical magic schoolbus around the moon
spacex,not_removed,this is hard data man its not that the sub is backwards its that the data says its been months out for the last several years
spacex,not_removed,are there any specific satellites that were scheduled for falcon heavy because of mass but have since been launched or rescheduled on falcon
spacex,not_removed,plus with such a bloated falcon manifest the company needs as many merlins as possible a fh consumes a lot of these i personally dont expect fh to fly in
spacex,not_removed,its not like the fh market doesnt have any customers whatsoever though arent there still dod payloads that still fly on the delta iv heavy if anything i would think a demo flight of fh would encourage customers to spec out and build heavier satellites
spacex,not_removed,that brings up a thought as the falcon performance has increased greatly over the years many payloads that would have had to go on fh are now flyable on in other words improvements themselves may have helped make fh less of a priority to get done if half the payloads you were going to fly with fh now can fly on the cheaper you have a lot less need to push the fh dev and the associated resources and people can work on
spacex,not_removed,good idea dont have the time for this now though one day maybe i will check that also
spacex,not_removed,using the highly precise method of holding my finger up and squinting the trendline on the second graph looks like it crosses zero in or but that trendline also includes the two falcon explosions so unless we have several more by im pretty sure well see the falcon heavy launch much sooner
spacex,not_removed,august rhighstakesspacex anyone i bet itll beat the trend line
spacex,not_removed,i dont know excel doesnt give the function and if i tried to extend the graph it would alter the trend line too so all we have is best judgement
spacex,not_removed,im not sure whether i want him to see it d from the pessimistic side its a graph of horrible lies from the optimistic side its just a graph showing for how long they didnt need the fh because improved so much in the meantime
spacex,not_removed,there is no interpolation there were reschedules and i tried to find the exact date if not possible then used the known ones before and after thats why you see some as and some as
spacex,not_removed,dragon that failed once by not deploying parachutes during rud and number of experimental technologies like raptor engine that was rather a semifail as it wasnt the root cause of the mission failure and as far as i know deploying parachutes wasnt even considered back then when they have successfully freeze development without retiring it then they can move to fh and in my humble opinion that would not happen this year i dont know which is better now they are at block so probably plan to launch a block fh then they would need to redesign it to block probably they know what they are doing also they may be designing another merlin version based on latest news about the cracks
spacex,not_removed,the article says the most recent previous estimate which is correctly cited in the doc as the estimate made on thats why i used the article in both lines basically i tried to find sources as close to a reschedule as possible both before and after thats why you see the graph sometimes not jumping up instantly but having a slope showing that the change happened somewhere in between and in this case this single article referenced both dates before and after that reschedule about the parabolicarc article you are correct i collected a lot of references in a big table and deleted most of them leaving only the first and last for each schedule date seems i left the wrong article from the interval when ever i need to post this again i will fix this reference im sure it was another archiveorg or rspacex link
spacex,not_removed,thats weird in an other comment thread i mentioned that excel told me the linear trendline hits zero on january based on months someone did a better calculation with exact days and they got august i guess doesnt matter in reality it will be in months anyway
spacex,not_removed,but that was just a previously announced date running out the clock this is an actual announcement of months
spacex,not_removed,great there you go
spacex,not_removed,great there you go
spacex,not_removed,if we fans think it has been hard always being months out from fh just imagine what it is like for the customers while i am guessing some were able to be moved to a with performance upgrades some have been on the heavy manifest for years
spacex,not_removed,would it then be reasonable to assume that the demo flight could be less than months i doubt they would forgo the demo flight all together with an extended turn around of maybe a month for data analysis the demo would take place around mid august this is purely conjecture mind you
spacex,not_removed,so its possible that a demo flight is much closer to now
spacex,not_removed,well they have actually built some of it now
spacex,not_removed,that would require fitting a payload fairing around dragon so as to comply with the faring requirement for usaf certification
spacex,not_removed,speculative water delivery would be complicated and so it would be expensive youd have to design a tank to store the water under launch conditions and in vacuum theres a lot of mass to spare so you could brute force the problem but its not a trivial issue you also need to prevent the water from either freezing if you reflect too much sunlight or boiling away if you absorb too much sunlight because its going to be many years before ula want to buy it you then have to have a docking and transfer system and transponders for tracking your water tank in orbit i dont think fluids have ever been transferred between spaceships without human assistance before so its definitely not off the shelf hardware then you have to commit to tracking your new satellite until a buyer is ready to take it from you which again could be years if ever its a great idea if youve got a buyer ready to go and you already know what their requirements are but now is way too early
spacex,not_removed,the only way dragon will make it to the surface of the moon is at a suicidal velocity
spacex,not_removed,well there should be dragonfly before red dragon flies and maybe even before so they wont be completely blind in terms of data and experience
spacex,not_removed,they have to launch with a fairing so no dragon plus dragon is very expensive
spacex,not_removed,true but there are lots of things that could be used as ballast a huge block of concrete or metal would be simplest but also boring im sure there are lots of people thinking that they should send up water or fuel or solar panels or any of a hundred different generic useful space components but thats almost certainly not worth the complexity if it were me choosing a payload id want something inert but cool like a metal statue or model and send it on a free return trajectory around the moon
spacex,not_removed,i still suspect first attempt at red dragon will be
spacex,not_removed,thanks for the clarification
spacex,not_removed,ah so its two flights okay that makes sense are they going to do or have they done a full duration fh burn on a test tower yet or are they just going to assume that will all work because theyre basically just cores strapped together
spacex,not_removed,it wasnt the comma that threw me but all the jargon do you realize that there are only three actual words in that ten word sentence the key was learning that was the name of a different flight i thought it was the designation of the falcon heavy demonstration flight or maybe the name of a launch pad or some such thing
spacex,not_removed,i was talking about a way to abort a failing flight while still saving the vehicle fh is a new beast with new challenges the chances of failure on the first flights would seem to be much higher than for the tested itd be nice if failure didnt mean complete loss of the vehicle it would mostly be a software issue though separating the cores in a safe way within the atmosphere may require hardware modifications
spacex,not_removed,of course not all anomalies would be detected in time or at all but itd be a neat capability and one that would be great to have on the flight of a new vehicle
spacex,not_removed,not necessarily but i hope so
spacex,not_removed,any kind of rud with the fh probably grounds their entire fleet i doubt that literally any boosters separation attachment points core desintegration due to higher than expected loads weird troubles with closely packed engines whole lot of fhspecific failures is possible
spacex,not_removed,im sorry but i dont quite follow why would a fh rud ground and if it did would it ground the as much as an actual rud
spacex,not_removed,problem here is that any kind of rud with the fh probably grounds their entire fleet not if its a fh specific failure like if the fh octaweb fails or if the connecting rods between the cores fail or if a booster fails to detach
spacex,not_removed,for one thing i think they need to get pad repaired and operational again with only pad available at the cape any accident that damages the pad will stop all of their east coast launches which is most of them leading up to the first heavy flight there will be ample opportunities for delays as they work out the kinks in the new system having pad up and running would minimize disruptions to their schedule
spacex,not_removed,so how to deploy satellites from bfs just punt them out the airlock
spacex,not_removed,its side boosters will do an amazing synchronised landing will they have two landing pads by then
spacex,not_removed,what is this magic school bus around the moon
spacex,not_removed,will they be synchronized for no particular reason i think i would space them out by offsetting the boostback burns but with everything automaticcomputer controlled i guess it wouldnt make much difference
spacex,not_removed,usourceaustralian clearly acknowledges the data and points out the sub is backwards in the interpretation of what the delays mean prevailing sentiment that its all because heavy development is too slow and there are too many problems with explosions and stuff distracting spacex vs falcon is so great that its covering demand that previously was thought to be the need of the heavy in the first place thus making heavy obsolete im not sure i entirely agree with the implication that this sub missed that point but the post wasnt disputing the delay data
spacex,not_removed,musk recently said their build rate is now at merlins per year given they hopeplan to launch every weeks in even if all those launches were on brand new no reuse x launches merlins per flight engines leaving merlins spare capacity which allows at least fh flight once you factor in the planned flightproven flight and the fact theyve probably got a little bit of a stockpile built up from their postamos downtime im sure theyve got no shortage of merlins
spacex,not_removed,isnt one of the side boosters for fh demo a rebuilt core if so thats merlins taken care of
spacex,not_removed,the thing with those payloads is theyre heavy and require direct injection into geosynchronous orbit to do this though spacex will need to modify the design of the second stage to have larger batteries and probably a better telemetry system to handle the coast up to geosync
spacex,not_removed,yes falcon can take the majority of the payloads that would otherwise have been on the original falcon heavy design i do think there is a fair chance falcon heavy finds a home if falcon cores can be reflown with minimal refusbishment easier flight profiles that allow high margin landings and rtls could be useful
spacex,not_removed,ill give you that action only because ill be happy to be wrong
spacex,not_removed,excel told me its
spacex,not_removed,excel doesnt give the function right click the trend line format trendline display equation on chart
spacex,not_removed,the slope and intercept functions can be used to get the slope and intercept of the regression line
spacex,not_removed,probably they know what they are doing lets hope so and by being a frontrunner in rocket propulsion technology of our times gives them huge responsibility imagine the damage spacex can cause if dont live up to their expectations yet they are slowing down which is actually a good trend and showing signs of maturity as a company
spacex,not_removed,the exact date is and its calculated with this messy rcode calculation according to unix timestamps of the dates within the rawdata plottimes fhremainingmonths ylabmonths until fh testflight xlabdate of testflight announcement mainfalcon heavy testflight resheduling ablinelinexdtimes ydfhremainingmonths colred colblack m linexdtimes ydfhremainingmonths a mcoefficients b mcoefficients cross asdateasposixctab origin tz cet ablinev ab colblue textx y labelscross col blue
spacex,not_removed,in yes but in we had some roughly month schedules now it finally seems to settle
spacex,not_removed,and the employees at spacex that have been working on fh for so many years granted im confident they havent been bored given the variety of projects happening there
spacex,not_removed,it is stated that the demo flight would be so quite a bit less than months probably around early summer
spacex,not_removed,i dont believe ula ever specified the phase state of the water send up a block of ice
spacex,not_removed,i should go and calculate the dv deficit and see if stuffing something like a in the trunk could help xd also maybe if they take off the heatshield that would save some more weight im not trying to suggest this is feasible at all but i enjoy the challenge of working out what needs to be done to make it work
spacex,not_removed,you are right dragon fly should collect the experimental data the video with hovering was the last for public i really really hope spacex release any new videos
spacex,not_removed,not a rocket scientist or even student but my thoughts are youd want to send something extremely durable and simple so as not to threaten the flight in any way think about in the martian how a rocket was destroyed by the food cubes liquefying under the launch vibrations and gload and the subsequent sloshing destroying the rocket a hunk of metal might be boring but an rud caused by a pointless whimsical payload would not be fun the payload has a very real effect on the rocket thats one reason why spacex preferred to have the payload on board for the static fire test i suspect part of this test flight will be testing the second stage ie pushing the limits in terms of its capabilities for multiple restarts long coast phases etc stage may even be an upgraded version for these purposes so while a lunar trajectory would be cool its not really what most customers want theyll probably do a test of multiple different earth orbits which i think is what the second fh flight is going to require
spacex,not_removed,how about httpwwwsciencealertcomthisjapanesecompanywantstoraindownartificialshootingstarsoverthetokyoolympics
spacex,not_removed,that is a fairly reasonable bet but spacex is still working on hitting its a pretty big company goal not some small secondary objective im still on if theyll pull it off but im remaining cautiously optimistic
spacex,not_removed,are they going to do or have they done a full duration fh burn on a test tower yet theyre not going to do a fullduration fully integrated falcon heavy burn before launch each core will get individually tested in mcgregor assembled at the launch site then quickly a few seconds static fired together before launch
spacex,not_removed,if its starts flying before fh starts flying it may never fly
spacex,not_removed,dont really understand why youre getting downvoted because youre completely right even at this point with some amount of hardware actually built fh still could never fly
spacex,not_removed,core desintegration due to higher than expected loads i think something like that might be hard to initially differentiate from a structural failure due to improper testing or manufacturing i think the overlap between fh and failure modes is a lot larger than most people think
spacex,not_removed,even if it turns out to be fh specific itll still take weeks to confirm and satisfy the government and customers most likely also just having cores strapped together means roughly higher chance of failure and the cost if it does happen
spacex,not_removed,but arent corebooster substantially similar to than they are different take previous failures for instance i would think either the strut or copv issue would have grounded fh as well had it been flying
spacex,not_removed,how do you even transfer that much thrust safely
spacex,not_removed,imo the issue would be less about the particular cause but that spacex couldnt predict and prevent it if closely packed engines lead to unexpected troubles the current might do so as well under some rarer conditions that just so happen for the first time when a falcon is about to launch your payload trust in spacexs engineering and qa teams is already probably not at an all time high right now and ula do advertise their reliability for a good reason
spacex,not_removed,wondering something about this i seem to recall on nsf last year hearing that the side boosters would pump some of their fuel and lox into the center core so that they then could separate and rtls sooner question is this true if true what other failure modes could this mean for the entire thing
spacex,not_removed,i doubt that literally any as long as shares any common operational procedure or system with fh failure of latter would ground fleet solution to this dilemma is very simple freeze development and immediately come up with experimental for utilization in fh program edit any changes introduced to to support fh configuration potentially will ground fleet in case of fh failure design should be frozen and any changes to support fh should be done on its variant this includes fueling procedure changes as well
spacex,not_removed,if an explodes during flight and ruptures the first stage tanks thatd ground because its a common element between both launch vehicles theres a ton of overlap between the two to the point where most kinds of fh failures could also be found on an however if it were an obviously fhspecific failure like booster separation any commonality could be rather easily ruled out which would mean it wouldnt ground as long as an rud
spacex,not_removed,but you dont know that at the time of the rud in most cases if a fh explodes they may have to ground everything until they can determine if it is caused by a common component or if it is a fh specific failure it may not be immediately obvious
spacex,not_removed,or vibrations that are clearly unique to the fh launch
spacex,not_removed,with only pad available at the cape any accident that damages the pad will stop all of their east coast launches which is most of them this is a common concern ive been seeing lately im of the opinion that if spacex has another accident bad enough to put out of operation theyre going to have way bigger issues than rebuilding a launch pad
spacex,not_removed,itd be cheaper than using a falcon laugh if you want but if they hit the reusability goal then even using a bfrits combo to put a little or something equivalent payload on orbit would be cheaper than throwing away a falcon once its comes online falcon will be an expensive system to keep launching
spacex,not_removed,i remain skeptical about the idea but it would work the same way they did from the space shuttle stick an upper stage on it point it in the correct direction and wish it luck the first two steps are optional it honestly sounds to be at least as viable as using the space shuttle as a satellite launcher with the correct upper stages you could handle in one launch what the falcon family can currently handle in three months a variant with a layout optimized for the task would be helpful but not strictly necessary two large shuttlestyle cargo bays one on each side of the dorsal landing leg fairing seem like features worth looking into if the idea is ever pursued
spacex,not_removed,theyll have three actually the one already at will be for the center booster if not utilizing asds while two smaller pads next to it will be for the side boosters from nsf which was posted a while back in this sub
spacex,not_removed,spacex has published a diagram showing that a school bus will fit inside the fairing ever since people are waiting for the school bus launch of course only on a fh test flight with no sensible payload and with the payload capacity to get the bus somewhere interesting like a lunar return orbit need i say this is never going to happen and everyone is aware of this
spacex,not_removed,i think boost back has a time for highest efficiency since both ride the same trajectory i would imagine this is the same for both and only wind and drag would space the landings out if im considering all the variables correctly
spacex,not_removed,even if the landing itself isnt synchronised id be pretty excited to see the separation and flip from various angles or even the possibility of watching one boosters landing burn from the other booster whatever happens its going to be cool
spacex,not_removed,good call they would not have stopped engine production due to atmos so a few months of grounding would easily leave them with the spare number of engines needed for a fh flight based on the leaked financials it looks like they dont suspend orders or anything the operating cost looked like it remained relatively constant during the groundings from this perspective if they have the spare hardware laying around then maybe it makes business sense if they have a launch window
spacex,not_removed,musk recently said their build rate is now at merlins per year thats amazing like one per workday
spacex,not_removed,yep thats one of the theories why or side cores may be reusedcuts down on the merlin thing significantly
spacex,not_removed,thats why elon recently tweeted that echostar will be expendable but future launches of a similar nature will be done on fh
spacex,not_removed,i calculated exact dates for the time remaining column instead of just using months
spacex,not_removed,til which seems to be ucalifornianion edit ulazybratsche
spacex,not_removed,uhh i guess you won this r thing looks interesting maybe one day i will watch some tutorials the input data is not the best however they are only dates in pairs before and after a reschedule not sure if thats the best to start with in this case also the trendlines seem to be different see the third data point in your graph its below the trendline in my excel graph its above the trendline
spacex,not_removed,its certainly positive that theyre talking about the second flight of fh as being this year and even the customer seems to have been given a rough timeline
spacex,not_removed,early summer is midjune which is about months
spacex,not_removed,it would melt in leo typical internal temperatures for satellites in leo without significant electronics is around or so theres enough heat radiated off of earth to keep things warm
spacex,not_removed,elon mentioned that with removing the heat shield and parachutes plus adding some additional fuel tanks that a dragon could land on the moon a few of us have had conversations about a trunk propulsion module before as well you could actually squeeze quit a bit out of a dragon if you really wanted to the trunk has plenty of space a center mounted superdraco could even have a vac nozzle in this configuration surrounded by a ring of cylindrical fuel tanks in the trunk would pack a lot of punch if we wanted to stay all spacex tech
spacex,not_removed,it comes down to whether theyre going to actually put it into geo or have it just stay in gto if its in gto its eventually going to reenter so having a hunk of metal is not a good idea ive had the good fortune to briefly work with the guys at the naval research lab as they were showing me around we went through their satellite lab one of the items they showed me was a satellite in the form of a bronze sphere the purpose of it was to study the drag effects of the upper atmosphere so it was spherical smooth and filled with batteries to power the radio transmitter this made it extremely heavy for its size however after building it they realized that it would most likely survive reentry intact which was more risk than they were willing to take they built a second one with nylon strips breaking it into pieces so that when it finally reentered the plastic would melt causing the satellite to break up and thus burn up the more likely thing to launch into gto if its going to be otherwise inert would be water its reasonably dense and once the proof is done they can vent the water which makes the remaining tank significantly lighter and will cause it to reenter and burn up more quickly all that said i really wish that theyd accept and there was ready an amsat payload but thats not going to happen even if there was a bird ready to go
spacex,not_removed,point is more or less what i was thinking of when i said space generic consumables would be too complicated if they had all payload testing and design done instantly for them for free they could send up a megasized iss delivery package with or more tonnes of food water spare parts lab equipment and so on
spacex,not_removed,so the first time they fire all the engines together will be on the launchpad arent they going to test it at least once at mcgregor to make sure everything is working as intended
spacex,not_removed,structural failure due to improper testing or manufacturing thats interesting bit even if failure is obviously unique for fh center core and flight dynamics it can put overall testing and modeling procedures at spx to question and require extensive review too
spacex,not_removed,if its any kind of upper stage failure it will
spacex,not_removed,i wouldnt give it the chance historically upper stages are a high percentage of failures and we still only have one of those your point is fair though still more failure modes
spacex,not_removed,i would think either the strut or copv issue would have grounded fh as well had it been flying yes they would i was arguing specifically with any kind of rud bit there are several failure modes that can be isolated to fhspecific hardware from the getgo as uoldsellsword below
spacex,not_removed,the family has a quite massive thrust structure that transfers the thrust of engines to the tanks that structure is well suited to tranfer thrust from the side boosters to the central core
spacex,not_removed,thats fuel crossfeed system it have been seriously considered for a while after fh announcement but development was put on indefinite hold awhile ago since and corresponding fh config gained so much performance that crossfeed isnt that much needed anymore
spacex,not_removed,im not sure it works that way the would still be a falcon derivative built using the same technologies processes and practices it would add another link to the chain but any failure that would ground the would result in the falcon being grounded as well it also seems that this falcon of yours isnt much more than a falcon with painted on the side otherwise it wouldnt be so trivial to develop i should point out that regulators and even many casual observers will probably notice the similarity
spacex,not_removed,sure but would fh have reason to increase failure over an for something like the that type of common component failure would seem to be just as much risk if they just launched more
spacex,not_removed,ah thanks for explaining
spacex,not_removed,but you dont have to wait until the issue is resolved and fhs are cleared to flight to make the fly again you just have to wait for confirmation that its a fh specific issue why are we talking about this its not going to fail i so hope i dont jinx it
spacex,not_removed,that could easily be one of the ones that is hard to differentiate from a familywide fault unless the particular vibration mode is observed in simulation beforehand and the vehicle is specifically instrumented to detect it it could take quite a bit of time to confirm that it is unique to the falcon heavy
spacex,not_removed,agreed based on the recent leaks it looks like they could really use some revenue for a good year before taking risks however it sounds like most folks on here are concerned with vibrations and harmonics of the fh vs the due to the engines with the full fuel tanks on the pad vibrations other than ground reflections etc wont come into full effect until the vehicle has spent some fuel in other words the full tanks should dampen things out a bit on the ground max q should be interesting though
spacex,not_removed,i have argued this for years but it is hard to imagine so many dont accept the argument
spacex,not_removed,yes but my point was whether those pads will be ready if the demo flight happens in this year have they even started building them
spacex,not_removed,never say never spacex will likely never do itwell they might still provide the service but if spaceflight becomes cheap enough i can see some eccentric billionaire doing it many decades from now just to prove the naysayers wrong hell maybe i should do it i just need to figure out the easy step one of becoming a billionare
spacex,not_removed,need i say this is never going to happen and everyone is aware of this why not that would be excellent pr and a great mass simulator payload for fh
spacex,not_removed,they could both start their boost back burns immediately but a small variation of the flight profile would be enough to offset the timing with a minimal difference in fuel consumption
spacex,not_removed,yes but i also see some potential for even lighter payloads than echostar to end up on falcon heavy the economics of reuse remain to be seen how much would it save on operational costs to do core rtls instead of having to land on the asds is refurbishment easier on rtls compared to asds landings these are the kinds of questions that we needed someone to actually do this kind of recovery and reuse to find out the answers
spacex,not_removed,to spacex fans waiting on falcon heavy that is so much closer than months
spacex,not_removed,sure but then why not just do that for money as they are contracted by nasa to do and if you launched to the iss you couldnt fulfil number above ie test the fh for its future customers on orbits they require
spacex,not_removed,not possible as the mcgregor flame trench is only big enough for a single core there would be very little gained by firing all three boosters while locked together as any issues with vibration and stress on the clamps will be much higher in flight around maxq
spacex,not_removed,i feel so stupid when browsing this subreddit its not like i dont understand what you guys say most of the time but you talk about concepts so far above my head
spacex,not_removed,youre probably right though its worth mentioning we still dont know if the fh upper stage will be an upgraded version of that of eg to allow longer coast phases or more relights
spacex,not_removed,falcon of yours isnt much more than a falcon with painted on the side you are correct that is exactly right at the beginning or starting point of introduction this approach assumes that is a solidstable rocket if there are no changes to its design lets say spacex desids to change fueling procedure and explodes on the pad that will not ground fleet if you have merlin engine failure on that it will ground fleet if fh made of fails at maxq due to structural integrity failure it will not affect fleet same case with fh made of will ground operations of
spacex,not_removed,sure but would fh have reason to increase failure over an for something like the yes the thermal vibrational and acoustic environment of engines is going to be much more complex than although that is still a challenge in itself
spacex,not_removed,great question in a word commonality its actually a problem with a lot of tech car airbags nuclear reactors aircraft samsung phones any sort of failure makes professionals and regulators ask it happened in x circumstanceproduct what about this related application
spacex,not_removed,gotta admit i am not loving all this rud talk
spacex,not_removed,of course not but given all the additional challenges associated with the fh it seems to me that the risk vs reward of flying the fh now before some of the back log is cleared does not make business sense does anyone have a breakdown financially why they would do this now with such a full schedule even the red dragon mission would still be achievable if the demo launched say or
spacex,not_removed,that is what instrumentation is for strain gauges are very lightweight and these days so are axis accelerometers these days i would think a failure could be narrowed to exclude flight norms quite quickly
spacex,not_removed,i think theyre having some difficulty wrapping their heads around the size difference bigger novaclass rocket doesnt seem like it possibly could be cheaper than the relatively tiny falcon but when youre throwing away that second stage
spacex,not_removed,ah my apologies i misunderstood as far as timeline i havent seen anything myself regarding a constructioncompletion date though someone can correct me if there is one i would assume however that they would want them to be completed before the fh launch good thing is the two new pads are going to be much smaller than the main pad so they should be easier to build and fh isnt scheduled until roughly the middle of the year and thats barring any additional delays
spacex,not_removed,i suppose they could concentrate on building one of them for now if there isnt enough time for two that would make two operational landing pads asds i guess it wouldnt make much sense to move just read the instructions from the west coast just for the demo flight since theres going to be quite a few flights from vandenberg this year
spacex,not_removed,they have not started building them yet but they recently got the go ahead to do so at their leisure building the actual landing pads not including the planned dragon testing and falcon refurbishment infrastructure will be fairly quick probably about a week per pad but then the concrete will have to cure for at least days before it can support a landing rocket so they have to start construction at least or weeks before launch so you dont have to worry about the lack of a constriction timeline until about two months before net launch
spacex,not_removed,yeah but how many billionaire school teachers do you know of
spacex,not_removed,if you become a multibillionaire start a company buying seats on the its if you can get funding for say billion try to buy seats of the first seats available with exclusive rights to nongovernment personal your investment would require passengers to recoup your investment before overheads at passengers per flight thats trips its a bad bet but would get spacex a huge chunk of the required funding
spacex,not_removed,why not i will assume you are joking but here goes lack of structural integrity for acceleration asymmetrical mass distribution lack of thrust structure and a coupling fixture to wateroilhydraulic fluid containers and tubes that will outgas in vacuum lack of control thrusters and control system to allow controlled reentry mass of iron engine block that will certainly survive reentry and create a hazard in the event of reentry inaccuracy making spacex look like a bunch of cowboys with apologies to our friends in texas and nevada
spacex,not_removed,its my understanding that all fh launches will have the core land on the asds as by the time it finished its just going to fast too far downrange
spacex,not_removed,i agree it wont happen and there is very little to be gained the flame trench however looks to me like it can handle a fh they have not built a te so they cannot erect it to try
spacex,not_removed,simplification if the big one goes boom it would help make the small one safer too
spacex,not_removed,they do mention direct geosynchronous insertion as a feature of falcon heavy that sounds to me as if a modified upper stage is absolutely planned that or the upper stage will evolve and theyre just not listing it as a falcon feature because reasons
spacex,not_removed,yes they must master before contemplating
spacex,not_removed,yes and many such failure modes would be hard to differentiate from failures that can happen on the that would ground for at least a while
spacex,not_removed,admittedly i dont have experience with this type of analysis so i may have made some unnecessarily cautious assumptions my main concern was aliasing in the spatial domain but i suppose the addition of data in the time andor frequency domains could be useful in resolving ambiguities through simulation assuming the necessary bandwidth is available for sufficiently detailed telemetry it could be less time consuming than i had originally estimated
spacex,not_removed,the only think im trying to wrap my head around is the mechanics of launching satellites from the bfs d i guess punt it out the airlock will work if the satellites will actually fit through the airlock in some configuration were going to be deploying habitats and large equipment items so there will be a cargo door of some kind you could even have astronauts up there doing predeployment checks and if something has broken during launch you can bring it back down and try again and youd still launch for less than a launch but the machine to launch the satellites a big carousel with satellites loaded into their acceleration cradles like bottles of tomato sauce on a lazy suzan or one of those conveyorstyle clothes racks drycleaners have or would it be more like a tape silo with the satellites strapped securely into their acceleration couches then have a big robot arm that picks them out and gently defenestrates them would this also serve to increase the maximum size of a satellite would there be a need for a spy satellite or communications satellite the size of a school bus im sure there are astronomers itching at the opportunity to launch an infraredhydrogen telescope with that kind of resolution
spacex,not_removed,its like driving a car and replacing the tires every trip or driving a dump truck and not yeah youre moving a much bigger thing and using less fuel but youre not replacing an actual vital component every time its might have significant maintenancerefit costs associated with the heatshieldother things that narrows the gap but youre still not throwing away half your vehicle every time
spacex,not_removed,the two new pads are going to be much smaller than the main pad so they should be easier to build actually the concrete pads are the same size the compacted rubble skirt around them is much smaller so some savings in building but not that much
spacex,not_removed,also im guessing that compared to launch pads they are a lot simpler
spacex,not_removed,days is a bit much on the set time i doubt they need full strength to support the rocket given the sandy soil of fl i would think most of the strength is to protect the foundation in the event of localized subsidence over time
spacex,not_removed,typical reddit post something silly and someone will give a well thought out response hell i do it all the time to others while i highly doubt i will ever be so wealthy i will keep this idea in mind id love nothing more than to significantly help fund the its
spacex,not_removed,lack of control thrusters and control system to allow controlled reentry that is precisely why it should be done and with lots of video coverage that would be some really great youtube right there if it got views they could recoup a couple hundred thousand dollars from ads d
spacex,not_removed,they are building more landing pads so that a core rtls can be done so its at least possible for some flight profile while falcon heavy center core will be much further down range and at a higher velocity than a falcon its still based on a rocket where the booster stages pretty early its is planned to stage a lot laterfaster and is being built to exclusively return to the launch site new glenn is a much larger boost stage that is planned to exclusively return to the launch site and while we dont know how far it will stage based on the size and approximate thrust it should be much further down range
spacex,not_removed,i would say that the ussr figured engines out in the but we all know how that ended
spacex,not_removed,youd need to redesign the upper stage sure this is a similar problem to using the red dragon to put rovers and experiments on mars how would this work exactly have you seen the httpwwwspacexcomsitesspacexfilesstylesmediagallerylargepublicdragonaloneonstagejpg or how are people going to get out of the heart of gold when on mars obvious problems have obvious solutions a bigger door a cargo door a ladder
spacex,not_removed,since i saw the window on the manned version i though that i could be a good cargo door on a cargo version if the cargo version came with a robotic arm punting it out that huge door would be totally viable on mars swap the arm for a crane that telescopes out the door to unload
spacex,not_removed,semantics d
spacex,not_removed,correct theyre not even remotely comparable landing pads are just slabs of concrete with sprinklers around it
spacex,not_removed,hey im being silly too really i just find it interesting to show just how difficult it will be to fund the its without government funding even assuming spacex dont go way over their estimate of in the order of i think selling seats on the system for is going to be difficult because is seats just to get it off the ground and yet nasa could fund it with one year of their budget again assuming costs dont spiral and apollo cost times as much if we as a species are really serious about colonising mars the governments should set up administrations to do exactly that perhaps even spin part of nasa into its own dedicated thing neca near earth colonization administration whether its subsidizing tickets to mars for private individuals or awarding contracts to various companies who are building martian and lunar habitats or just general mars administration the only way this is going to happen is if governments take it seriously with an apollo style budget colonization of mars is now inevitable the investment will eventually be worth it for earths economy but probably not for years or so
spacex,not_removed,it had a lot to do with the engine management though not all failures were because of the engines themselves
spacex,not_removed,did you know that on the most of the engines were not tested at all before launch they would test one out of every manufacturing batch so for most of the engines the one and only time they were ever fired was during the launch attempt also they had severe problems with quality control poor qa and skimping on testing are not a good combo spacex operate very differently
spacex,not_removed,deploying a drone from that door would be easier i think if the marsian atmosphere allows it
spacex,not_removed,mostly yes but there is a little more to it than just pouring concrete on the ground you can bet a geotec report is needed typically weeks week if cores are drilled in addition to the environmental report they already commissioned then some sort of fill is usually added forms and rebar take time since they are going to build the pad to last it will have rebar then there is probably a week delay for the pad to set up after pouring i dont know sounds doable for the landing pads if it were my project i think it could be accomplished in under months source work for epc firm
spacex,not_removed,see this is another one of those comments a really interesting read and opinion i find myself agreeing with
spacex,not_removed,using rockets as surface transports is completely unnecessary imho electric vehicles will be much more efficient and will travel at surprisingly rapid speed in the martian environment ive been doing research for a book and if you had an electric vehicle the size and weight of a fully loaded semitruck kg travel kilometers on mars it would take about kwhrs including the cost of running life support and other systems and taking into account driving on loose sand and gravel the best range speed for such a vehicle is kmh and the trip would take a bit over hours when you do a tangential curve analysis on the efficiency chart you can see that you can travel in excess of kmh with a relatively low impact on efficiency more energy to go times as fast and the trip would take less than two hours obviously the limiting factor for speed will be the terrain if it is a smooth plain you could travel quite fast but if its in a hillycliff area then you would be forced to slow down i think it would be pretty simple to map out and clear a path for high speed rovers on mars pretty early into the life of a colony
spacex,not_removed,a fascinating analysis of mars surfacetosurface transport capabilities using the its spaceship aka bfs of course the numbers will be different for different designs and at some point people on mars will probably want craft optimized for specific uses but the its ship will be available from the start so its numbers are particularly relevant looking at the propellant consumption graphs from the viewpoint of a settlement that has to produce the propellant it looks like there are particular travel distances below which such a hop seems much more practical than greater distances to my eye a trip seems most practical if its km or less beyond that distance the propellant consumption rises very quickly for a trip the most practical limit seems to be more like km travel beyond those thresholds is possible but the settlers will really complain about the expense in propellant one comment on the scale on the right side of the second graph volume of water needed to make the fuel i posted back in october that were fairly rambling but eventually got to the conclusion that the metric tons of propellant could be produced by mining metric tons of water however the electrolysis plant would have to process metric tons of water on average the water is electrolyzed twice this is possible because the oxygen removed from the by the sabatier process eventually ends up in the oxygen storage tank in fact after filling the tanks of the spaceship theres of oxygen left over for the settlement to use
spacex,not_removed,between the super low atmosphere and the lower gravity less rolling resistance wouldnt simple cars move insanely fast at very high efficiency good old roads are probably all you need on mars
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if spacex might later do a marsmanufactured variant of its optimized for travel within the mars system eliminate the sea level raptors mars atmosphere is effectively vacuum anyway flow separation is a non issue eliminate the solar arrays and reduce life supportonboard amenities everywhere on the surface is reachable within minutes everywhere within deimos is reachable within days lighten the tps since mars entries arent nearly as harsh as interplanetary earth entries remove booster attachment hardware maybe stretch the tanks slightly etc could add several tons to its payload capacity to any target and remove manufacturingrefurbishment cost and failure risk
spacex,not_removed,how likely is it that this option ever will be used as a transport means on mars first of all we need to find the perfect spot for the first base mba this location will be chosen with great care and the presence of natural resources will be the most important aspect taken into account there is however very unlikely that well find a spot with all desirable natural resources but the one to be found at mba will be abundant enough to sustain a settlement for the foreseeable future after the first landing of the its the first thing thatll happen is construction of facilities on ground water wells factories for production of construction materials habitats green houses solar farms et cetera major investments will be made in local infrastructure on and near the mba building up the infrastructure will take a long time and as population grows the expansion of the infrastructure continues it will not be finished in several decades possibly centuries by that time well be so heavily invested in that location so moving is not an option and establishing a second base at a better location will be several orders of magnitude more expensive than just keep on expanding the existing base eventually other essential natural resources will be found far away from mba and when so there will be another base set up there mbb it will probably be a base dedicated to extract the present natural resources with a minimum of other buildings and infrastructure and the sole purpose to feed mba with raw material think of off shore oil rigs where personell from mba go to work at mbb for a limited amount of time the equipment needed will probably be built on earth and some kind of transporter optimised for transport of the raw material from mbb to mba will be included in the whole infrastructure my bet is that ground transports will be the most efficient way possibly autonomous electric vehicles perhaps built at mba in convoys feeding mba with raw material even if mba and mbb are located on opposite sides of mars the total travel time on land will be in the order of weeks or months and the time is not an issue for an autonomous vehicle also thatll be way way in the future probably the its is outdated by the time
spacex,not_removed,i might be missing something but why not use a plane the service altitude on the helios was just shy of up and it had a payload of over i know it was big and bulky and that payload doesnt sound like a lot but at low altitudes on mars the actual air density is really close to the air density that the helios prototype was flying at i guess power might be a bit of a concern as it wont get as much solar power on mars but given the fact that helios was able to fly in here surely it would have been able to fly in at a similar air density i dont know much about aerodynamics but does the pressure matter or is it just the density that matters if not then that denser atmosphere should help as a pure atmosphere is denser than air at the same temperature and pressure any thoughts as to why an electric plane wouldnt work takeoff and landing might have to happen at high speeds but i guess you could still use rockets for takeoff and landing and still save enormously on fuel how would you go about trying to figure out cruising speed service ceiling payload and other parameters for a hypothetical martian aircraft
spacex,not_removed,an interesting influence would be the availability of its vehicles elon has stated that some of the initial vehicles may not fly back at least not early on and we know from the ongoing development that reusability may be limited for the early versions and will not be unlimited even for the later versions by that logic each trip on mars will cost you one trip to earth or maybe some fraction of a trip because of the smaller loads on the vehicle in terms of physical vehicle availability this may or may not be a significant cost since freight will mostly be moved to mars and not to earth im going to assume that flights to earth will only be done with vehicles that are new enough to be able to fly back to mars outside of testing and museum vehicles id imagine that you will eventually have a bunch of its vehicles stacked up on mars who may be able to go to earth but not back to mars from there and maybe some vehicles where you are not sure and vehicles who cant go back to earth but are still structurally sound enough for local flights this would mean that you get the vehicle for free and only have to think about the fuel cost incurred when flying around on mars
spacex,not_removed,in the martian economy water is the new oil burning this much of such a precious limited resource for such trivial purposes seems like mega overkill even if the its could actually go there and back again
spacex,not_removed,fascinating concept it jives with the notion that the its may end up being used on earth as a way of travelling to the far side of the planet as screamingly fast as physics allows along with its stated goal of opening up the solar system as a marsbased travel option it initially sounds wasteful unless the plan is to have multiple human bases on mars already or multiple fueling locations not necessarily manned myself im convinced that elon will indeed start off with two separate mars bases and given his track record of naming conventions in terms of creativity and consistency he will name them thus mars base alpha moon unit zappa you read that right

spacex,not_removed,can it hop effectively on earth as well i put in earth r and g and it couldnt make km but i would think areobreaking would help some i would be cool to see the bfss saving stranded people and remote communities in crisis events in its wait between mars windows if that ever becomes practical
spacex,not_removed,i think the best way would be rover like solar powered autonomous vehicles frankly speed does not matter as much as people think it greatly increases the likelihood of accidents and breakage which would be bad considering theyd likely get stuck from the next human capable of helping using slow rovers just means you need more of them to transport the same tonnage in the same time but in exchange they would be much simpler to built repair and massproduceideally using the same solar cells and batteries as the colony constant human travel on the mars surface would be illadvised anyway since the mars has no magnetosphere you really want some protection between you and the cosmic rays bombarding the mars surface protection a vehicle or spacesuit wouldnt give
spacex,not_removed,id think it would be much more useful to ferry some special scramjets or falcon rockets up there for quick transport using the its would be great except for the massive amounts of fuel it would use
spacex,not_removed,the article doesnt mention anything else about an electric car tesla on mars it would also require cooling for the batteries no i think that the number mode of transportation will at first be dedicated mars buggiesrovers once a colony is fully developed a hyperloopesk railway will be built
spacex,not_removed,i know mars is a lot colder but is there a chance that the thin atmosphere could cause overheating problems for electric vehicles
spacex,not_removed,what if we laid a railway i mean its not going to be like earth with towns all over the place even mining fields could have a railhead served by rovers
spacex,not_removed,you really think youll be able to speed through the rocky uneven unpaved martian surface at
spacex,not_removed,using rockets as surface transports is completely unnecessary imho travel kilometers on mars and the trip would take a bit over hours i must disagree with completely unnecessary since thats not very useful for emergency medical transport obviously most trips are not made for emergency medical transport just as on earth you dont commute to work in a life flight helicopter ride but that doesnt mean life flights are completely unnecessary
spacex,not_removed,i would love to see a vehicle in that class that is essentially a mobile lab send the major components pre assembled but build out the structure on site give it the supplies to travel to a remote site deploy an array of solar panels to recharge and then conduct work at that location for long term plans we need a way to prospect for resources all over the planet and bring back high value materials including scientific samples
spacex,not_removed,electric vehicles will be much more efficient and will travel at surprisingly rapid speed in the martian environment if you have been following the curiosity rover you will know there needs to be
spacex,not_removed,dont forget about geography doing kmh offroad is pretty tough but there will be hills and canyons in the way as well developing a transporation infrastructure on mars will take a lot of time
spacex,not_removed,the author addressed that he acknowledged that other means are definitely more effective and practical the point was to show that transport with the its on mars would be theoretically feasible and in limited cases even useful such as emergencies
spacex,not_removed,not quite the math is quite a lot more complex than that you need to take into account rolling resistance drag and parasitic load which all depend differently on speed httpiimgurcomhssosenpng
spacex,not_removed,highway speeds on raw rocky dusty ground in low gravity that sounds extremely dangerous
spacex,not_removed,drivers on mars are rapidly going to learn that you have to scale down your speed proportionally to the local gravity even on pristine smooth roads vehicles will need to have their wheels set very wide to avoid rolling over at speed and skidding will be a problem for a long time people are just going to have to accept travelling very slowly at speeds that seem a third of safe speed to an earth drivers instincts
spacex,not_removed,the possibility of a hyperloop for transport on mars is also interesting the hyperloop wouldnt have to make many turns it wouldnt be slowed down significantly by the atmosphere meaning that a giant vacuum chamber is not required and lastly the reduced weight of things would make accelerating easier and drag less impactful this type of a hyperloop should easily be able to achieve i didnt do the math but it does seem reasonable the only problem i can think of is the terrain mars has some big mountains and hills you wouldnt want to make turns when traveling over because the radius of the turns would have to be enormous obviously this isnt going to be something we will see any time soon wheelbased vehicles will definitely be better to start out with in the long run though a hyperloop might be more cost effective and definitely faster
spacex,not_removed,that quick rise is due to the log scale fuelkm actually falls off for larger distances
spacex,not_removed,excellent point i had completely forgotten about the oxygen atoms released from the during the reaction ill see if i can update the graph
spacex,not_removed,the its ship will be available from the start so its numbers are particularly relevant no it wont the its heads back once refueled it certainly doesnt waste an entire return trip worth of fuel doing what a truck can do better
spacex,not_removed,i think this is for the really early days when infrastructure is sparse
spacex,not_removed,i could be wrong but i would think that lower gravity would be a bad thing your friction of tires against the ground is dependent on your weight and if gravity is weaker it means youre going to have a harder time getting any grip every land speed record car uses aero surfaces to squeeze itself against the ground since speed requires you to be pushed hard against the ground either by gravity or other forces
spacex,not_removed,i dont think you can remove the sea level raptors something that has been touched on by a few people is that its likely that for the retro landing burn that firing into the pressure front is not something the vacuum engines could do we dont know if this is the case or not its possible that they could still be optimized for those conditions and not the earth return landing but thats a bit harder to do you cant physically fit larger engine bells in their place
spacex,not_removed,i suspect that as this analysis shows us rocketbased transport is highly fuel inefficient for intraplanet transport this isnt much of a surprise analyses on this sub of such transportation schemes on earth have showed them to be a stretch economically even with optimistic assumptions of cost reductions i suspect that the answer is just to go slower lacking oceans or an atmosphere this means vehicles perhaps theyll burn methane and oxygen for long distance travel rather than use batteries
spacex,not_removed,it is possible the first its to land on mars will be stripped of all the return to earth equipment since it is likely it will serve as the initial tank farm for refueling later flights it could be converted into a mars hopper after a new larger tank farm has been built from local materials since the first its on mars is not intended to return there is no reason to have sea level raptors on it i was expecting it to have fewer than the standard number of raptors since removing unneeded engines leaves more mass for cargo but it could fly with raptor vac engines just so that it could be used as a hopper later if clearance issues can be resolved
spacex,not_removed,density is what matters not pressure reducing the acceleration due to gravity to would also reduce the lift needed to of what it was or equivalently increase the vehicle mass to of what it was this should be able to compensate for the halving of solar power at mars orbit great post
spacex,not_removed,any thoughts as to why an electric plane wouldnt work i had an exchange of emails with one of the curiosity lander people about wings on mars you can fly subsonic with huge wings and a very light payload so flying solar powered drones are possible for craft capable of carrying a person you have to go supersonic and no one knows how to land at supersonic speeds no wheels are good enough no runways are long and smooth enough you might be able to use rockets to slow down and land propulsively but if you are going to o that it is more efficient to do a suborbital hop and leave off the wings
spacex,not_removed,or more boringly slap some inflatable aerofoils onto the its and do a boostglide in the event you need to move it a long distance across mars
spacex,not_removed,theres an awful lot of water on mars httpswwwgoodisarticlesmarsicewaterdiscovery
spacex,not_removed,musk wrote on twitter that developing an its for trans atlantic service was a tempting idea it appears to be physically possible but economically questionable since launch prep and the countdown cost so much more than with a jet airliner at some distances fuel efficiency is better than supersonic air travel since you have no air drag for most of the flight
spacex,not_removed,scramjets require air breathing machines falcons require kerosene both are not suited for mars i could imagine vtvl supersonic airplanes some time down the line
spacex,not_removed,sorry i certainly didnt mean to imply that actual telsas would be used for ground transportation the figure was just meant to given an general indication of how much range we might expect from an approximately carsized electric vehicle designed for use on mars
spacex,not_removed,dont need a hyperloop atmosphere is so thin a normal railway can go verry fast
spacex,not_removed,its definitely a design challenge the issue is that even though mars is cold the atmosphere is so thin radiating heat is not very efficient so when you have a mobile vehicle that needs to get rid of a lot that becomes tougher the main heat issue is related to current draw so it creates a design balance from how fast you can travel and how much mass and complexity you can devote to radiators kmh off road on a planet with no roads is also nuts speeds anywhere close to that need a road even a simple one i could see some kind of technology being developed to create roads between sites it can start as normal slower rovers taking the same path repeatedly to compact the surface into a dirt road of sorts but eventually some sort of isru paving needs to happen a machine that can print regolith into a concrete or other suitable road material would be incredibly valuable to martian civilization
spacex,not_removed,yepyou need to get rid of heat eventually you cant do that without a thick atmosphere maybe there can be radiators on top of the vehicle
spacex,not_removed,maybe the mars vehicles could store liquid oxygen which would then be used to cool the batteries and motors there will be lots of it available from the factories the boiling of the liquid oxygen should get rid of quite a bit of heat liquid hydrogen which can also be made on mars would be even better because it takes a very large amount of energy to heat up of hydrogen by making it very efficient for the task
spacex,not_removed,i dont think that is a actual problem you can cool down even in space and with low gravity comes lower energy spent on going up the hill the real problem is the cold how do you start a car after a night does the car support that tenperature or do you keep it consuming energy just to be warm on the bright side maybe we can use super conductors at ambient temperature and be allot more efficient then current earth cars
spacex,not_removed,martian railways would be awesome the rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel tracks is tiny
spacex,not_removed,are we talking steel rails or a maglev system
spacex,not_removed,no not without something being done ahead of time but when we are talking about developing a martian economy we can start talking about smoothing out primitive roads too
spacex,not_removed,if the road surface is prepared properly it should be possible to go pretty quickly in the north everyone looks forward to the freezup for transportation as frozen gavel roads are a lot better to drive on than muddy ones the surface of mars is pretty much frozen regolith so once you smooth things out and clear away the loose sand and large rocks it should be pretty good driving
spacex,not_removed,i dont mean to break this off into a tangent but this is something ive been thinking a lot about people are going to die on mars lots of people and we need to be ok with this no more no americans will die in space mentality let alone the death from old age and the fact that the people who can afford to move to mars will be relatively older anyways there is going to be a very high death rate the death rate will likely surpass the birth rate for a very very very long time mars is dangerous once you have a whole colony to worry about you have to be very wise about resource usage if for example a single rescue flight in the its uses so much rocket fuel that a launch window to earth is missed that is probably too high a cost to society for the rescue of a single person that social equation shifts when there are alternatives perhaps there are smaller rockets used for this purpose designed to transport only people and no cargo perhaps electric vehicles are very fast and can bring a medical team within hours im not convinced that the giant rocket will be useful for site to site transport on mars when you weigh the implications to the colony
spacex,not_removed,as far as i know martian surface isnt more nasty than the average earth surface it is just that curiosity was massively weight constrained and as the result the wheels are flimsy coke cans when the weight constraint is much smaller with lets say its then it shouldnt be a massive problem to use fairly stock rugged wheels
spacex,not_removed,to echo ufoxhoundbat the curiosity is having wheel trouble because it had severe weight limits for the launch which resulted in wheels that are made from incredibly thin aluminium the wheels on a vehicle built on mars by a mars colony could be much sturdier much more like what we use on earth
spacex,not_removed,absolutely there will be hills and canyons in the way thats why you would have to either map out routes ahead of time and remove any boulders in the way and go slower in rough terrain especially if and when you would need to go on switchbacks but if you had a primitive road even if it was just smoothed out and compacted regolith you could design the suspension system of the vehicle handle the rest it is low gravity after all
spacex,not_removed,i wont argue that the math is complex i took that all into account aerodynamic drag is x roh x x cd x a and depends greatly on velocity rolling resistance drag is frr crr x n which has nothing to do with velocity but everything to do with mass gravity slope of the ground and what type of wheels are driving on what type of surface i even took hill climbing into the equation when it comes to parasitic loads this is where my math is better than the charts you provided your chart does not posit a vehicle that has to run life support running life support takes a lot of energy and is based on time in use not vehicle speed so when you start to figure in parasitic loads and vital system energy usage it starts to push the best range speed to a higher velocity this is not saying that total drag is lower at higher speeds it just means that at faster speeds you are wasting less energy on life support because it is taking less time to get to the destination my work is incomplete and i am currently trying to add in the effects of wheel slippage which can be significant for example wheel slippage can result in doubling the rolling resistance but i can already simulate this my model by simply doubling the frr and the results do not change much the best range speed is still right around kmh what i need to do is find a formula that will give me correct frr based on wheel velocity and i can be more accurate and i would expect these high velocities to come down a bit but all in all i am happy with my model so far when i plug in a model s into the simulation in an earth environment i get the expected range and velocities of a real model s so while incomplete i am pretty confident in the results so far
spacex,not_removed,what about banked corners also the whole thing being wider is totally fine in a such low pressure enviromet
spacex,not_removed,i was waiting for this to be suggested instead of the discussion of quaint trains and articulated trucks mars will have significant tunneling equipment available for use and with the lower gravity it will also be easier to move the spoil around to raise the topology where required carving long term hyperloop tracks into the landscape will organically create new destinations along its path as well as the end nodes moving bulk cargo via hyperloop isnt as huge a challenge as any equipment thats rated on earth can handle approx three times the volume on mars due to the lower gravity not requiring a vacuum transition zone means much faster loading and unloading of pods onto the lines
spacex,not_removed,good point that the apparent knee in the curve disappears if you go do a linear distance scale a better way to put it is that the settlement doesnt want to risk not having enough propellant available at the next favorable mars to earth window and the larger the amount of propellant that is used on this surface to surface hop the greater the risk of that happening
spacex,not_removed,no it wont i wrote at some point people on mars will probably want craft optimized for specific uses so yes at some point in time there will probably be multiple sorts of wheeled vehicles maybe lightweight point to point rocketpowered hoppers that dont use as much propellant as the bfs and apparently even some kinds of aircraft will be feasible though i dont know whether any will be large enough to carry humans but to start with there probably wont be any marsspecific vehicles other than those that are optimized for water mining tunneling or shortdistance transport of people and cargo but if humans are there then by the spacex model there will also be itsbfs there at least part of the time therefore it makes sense to calculate what it could do for example in an emergency therefore thettttmans analysis was a worthwhile exercise the its heads back once refueled even if refueling is completed in between launch windows i got the impression that the envisioned most common scenario was that in the early days of the first settlement successive missions would be staggered so that if for example the arriving bfs crashes you dont end up with a two to four year period where nobody can leave mars it certainly doesnt waste an entire return trip worth of fuel i specifically noted that trips using less than metric tons of propellant to of a tankful would be more feasible and more likely to be approved than trips requiring more propellant doing what a truck can do better yes if the truck is available and if it can do the job better then of course choose the truck even if it can do the job just as well then choose the truck to minimize the risk of damage to the bfs but good longdistance trucks are unlikely to be available in the early days of mars settlements and even when they are in an environment with limited technological resources mars it makes sense to inventory the available equipment and figure out what it may be capable of so that the information is available in case of emergencies
spacex,not_removed,no it wont the its heads back once refueled yes it will musk has said that some early ships will not return so the number of mct available on the surface wont be zero it certainly doesnt waste an entire return trip worth of fuel doing what a truck can do better for delivering rocks no of course not for an emergency medical evac or to rescue a science expedition after their trucks onboard life support system fails sure since hoppers are much faster than trucks
spacex,not_removed,on the other hand they brought a car to the moon and it seem to mostly work
spacex,not_removed,im also no expert but i think record cars on earth do that because the limiting factor isnt power theyre needed to prevent loss of control from hitting a tiny bump and youd have less acceleration but be more efficient since a lot of rolling resistance is from the tire deforming from the weight which is why under inflated tires are inefficient
spacex,not_removed,the question then is what is more efficient economically especially early on the infrastructure for fuel production is going to exist at least at a small scale from day and it shouldnt be too complicated to scale up arbitrarily and once the infrastructure is in place the marginal cost of producing more fuel will be very low car production is an entirely different matter it will take decades to reach that level of industrialization and even once it is technically feasible it will probably still be a low priority compared to other projects and bringing them from earth isnt a pleasant idea either too expensive to bring enough to be useful rovers will be necessary from the beginning for construction and transport within the base but those are unlikely to be useful for driving hundreds of kilometers greyhound bus vs a backhoe long term cars andor hyperloop will probably win out but i expect there will be a few decades of rockets having a near monopoly on long range transport
spacex,not_removed,perhaps theyll burn methane and oxygen for long distance travel rather than use batteries i guess solarbattery electric rovers are more suitable batteries are more efficient than fuel cells and more reliable than internal combustion engines due to the lower number of moving parts also you can harvest your fuel on the way maybe you could equip a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiblimp with solar cells and tow it with a cable attached to your electric rover but i don´t really know how effective dirigibles are in the atmosphere of mars
spacex,not_removed,the real issue here is rockets vs aircraft for long range travel short range hop in a rover a truck or a bus or a train much later suborbital travel is more energy efficient than air travel for very long distances because you use more fuel fighting air resistance than you use getting out of the atmosphere there are also the problems of heavy wings and high landing speed except for solar powered drones all aircraft on mars will be supersonic anything big enough to carry a person has to fly supersonic to generate enough lift in the thin air the real problem is landing at supersonic speeds no one has ever built wheels or skids capable of that and you need a very long flat runway you could use retro rockets to slow down and land like a helicopter but if you do that you might as well build a hopper and do everything propulsively source for landing speeds a jpl mars rover guy i emailed
spacex,not_removed,perhaps theyll burn methane and oxygen for long distance travel rather than use batteries i have to wonder about taking inspiration from mark watney and going solar that way youd remove a step and the associated losses from motor i mean the rover can afford to be a lot less aerodynamic and somewhat heavier for the same tire area given the conditions on mars and apparently the average solar insolation is only slightly less than earth on the surface due to the thinner atmosphere might it be possible to make a purpose designed long range solarbattery rover
spacex,not_removed,that wouldnt make any sense it might stay for a few synods but they need it back eventually cheaper to bringbuild dedicated tanks than to keep leaving itses behind
spacex,not_removed,well the math on the payload wouldnt really work out like that im assuming you used to get but thats just the payload theres going to be a lot of excess lift if you assume that the lift is the same as on earth because not only does the payload exert only of the force it would on earth the airplane itself exerts only of the force the maximum weight is listed as so thats a little over kn of lift on mars assuming that the same amount of lift could be generated that would mean that you could have a max weight of since the plane is that would leave you with of payload that sounds unrealistic so add in a healthy fudge factor of a couple hundred kilos and were still looking at of payload compared to the original payload that means that the same plane could carry of its max payload on earth
spacex,not_removed,lake superior humanity is struggling with water resources on a planet where water literally falls out of the sky and covers of the surface if were looking at long term colonization thousands of years then that really isnt that much water it becomes even less water when you remember that you have to mine it out of the ground like coal for reference here is a pretty big lake that because even with a water cycle actively trying to fill the lake thats still not much water relative to the human needs of a nationsized body of people
spacex,not_removed,at some distances fuel efficiency is better than supersonic air travel since you have no air drag for most of the flight thats certainly true the flipside is that the propulsive efficiency watts per newton of thrust is a lot lower for a rocket than an airbreathing engine propeller or wing
spacex,not_removed,i thought scramjets were supposed to work at high altitudes on earth where the air is thin making it suitable for mars
spacex,not_removed,oh its ok i kind of do like the idea of teslas on mars
spacex,not_removed,the atmosphere also carries highly abrasive dust bad for the pods and can cause it drift and accumulate on the tracks very bad for the pods a mars system may not need a structural tube but a contaminant exclusion tube which is lighter cheaper etc would be highly desirable
spacex,not_removed,ive been wondering while watching the episode of the natgeo mars thing if your heating cooling system in your mars suit was turned off for some reason would you overheat rather than freeze and how long would it take until it becomes a problem
spacex,not_removed,what about a train using its rails as a heat sink
spacex,not_removed,both take a lot of energy to make and are hard to store oxygen will be in excess but will likely be needed for other purposes maybe compressed liquid would be better but radiative cooling would be much better if possible make the body of the vehicle large and use the whole surface of the heated volume for heat rejection
spacex,not_removed,lower gravity as well oh gosh imagine how long the trains could be with a conventional locomotive
spacex,not_removed,steel rails on regolith sleepers maglev is high maintenance and cant shift bulk freight such as from a mine rolling resistance isnt really that much of an issue
spacex,not_removed,gravel road is still a road that must be constructed it is not just clearing big boulders off and even then noone in their right mind goes over a kmh un a gravel road in any condition especially not a frozen one where a an unevenly frozen patch can just break your wheel instantly and you will not see it in advance due to irregular texture
spacex,not_removed,perhaps there are smaller rockets used for this purpose designed to transport only people and no cargo agreed thats exactly the type of solution im picturing you said using rockets is completely unnecessary which is where i disagreed even something like the httpsenwikipediaorgwikilunarescapesystems would work since its main drawbacks can now be solved with lightweight computers and imus
spacex,not_removed,plus they didnt really expect just pointy rocks sticking out esas emily ludsomething sorry had a great blog entry on this and what they are doing differently for mars rover
spacex,not_removed,have you looked into wheeltire materials for mars in your research inflatable tires work well on earth i wonder if there are suitable materials to make inflatable tires that would work on mars
spacex,not_removed,built on mars implies easy relatively access to the materials do we know for a fact that we can find the stuff and have the ability to make steel and electrical components fairly early on either with mining which wont have rail cargo haulers at first or scattered along the surface along with as i mentioned the ability making a big forge thats capable of manufacturing the final materials or would we be relegated back to the stone age plus some manufacturing improvements and importing
spacex,not_removed,do wheels on earth have to work with razor sharp rocks sticking out of the ground that do not get blunted by weathering
spacex,not_removed,gravity does no matter in a wheel impact you have forward momentum and inertia in the vehicle a wheel goes down into a hole how hard will it hit the rim of the hole almost as hard as at same speeds on earth because the vehicle total mass is the important bit here and not its weight and with any significant crash causing vehicle depressurisation and no aaa around who would do such a crazy thing noone crazy people will be the ones driving on mars over and not
spacex,not_removed,you might be interested in the efficiency curves for the tesla model s and the tesla roadster httpswwwteslacomblogroadsterefficiencyandrange httpswwwteslacomblogmodelsefficiencyandrange a fun exercise is to choose four points on the curve and use algebra to reconstruct the constant load watts rolling drag whmi and the aerodynamic drag term
spacex,not_removed,you could build banked corners but i suspect the costbenefit even for something so low tech isnt going to compare well against just travelling slowly building piles of angled regolith at each corner takes time and energy going slowly is free in the first decades almost all ground vehicles will be for exploration bulk hauling or will be some kind of selfpropelled machinery like construction equipment the industrial gear doesnt really need fast roads and exploration teams will have to travel away from them anyway
spacex,not_removed,what use case are you imagining hyperloop is low mass low throughput high speed single point to single point trucks can go anywhere to anywhere and trains can carry more than any other possible mode on a world without oceans both of them in a network that can branch if you have a mine a long way from mba you want a freight train if you have a wide field of say greenhouses needing to send back harvest you want a truck hyperloop cant lug a long trail of ore trucks the way a train can nor can it stop off at tens of collection points like a truck can if you want to connect two martian cities and sticking a pressurised car on the fright train or running a bus back and forth is too slow then hyperloop might make sense seeing as mars cant do passenger air travel carving long term hyperloop tracks into the landscape will organically create new destinations along its path as well as the end nodes hyperloop cant branch without stopping
spacex,not_removed,if crashes are a concern that would be an argument against using them for local travel aside from canyons mars is a lot more traversable on the ground than unpaved earth is your premise is that other resources will be required early but this makes no sense variety of resources will be needed later not early i cant think of a single resource that could be usefully gathered using the spaceship
spacex,not_removed,those werent going very fast though and bouncing a lot
spacex,not_removed,theyre needed to prevent loss of control from hitting a tiny bump wouldnt the same design factor apply on mars
spacex,not_removed,and bringing them from earth isnt a pleasant idea either i disagree we currently dont have a good way of doing it but designing a vehicle for mediumlong distance travel on mars as long as a human is present that folds up nicely is totally possible i think a lot of the resources mentioned in this can be found waaaay closer than halfway across the planet and sending rockets places will for a long time be a semirisky process you cant let the fate of the entire colony ride on a success rate of a single launch every time you need new water
spacex,not_removed,the advantage of the hyperloop is you wouldnt have to depressurize it anymore
spacex,not_removed,as i understand it colonising mars is only economically possible if the bfs returns to earth the same synod that it left thats the reason for the fast journey times the typical bfs will leave earth travel for or months land on mars spend perhaps a week refuelling from existing onsite depots then fly back to earth on earth it gets refurbished and made ready to go again in the next synod it needs to do a round trip every years months not every years months so were not going to have a bunch of bfs sitting around on mars idly waiting for the next synod we cant afford it each bfs that stays on mars for years reduces the growth rate of the mars colony and is a waste of capital unless it has some very worthwhile job to do there we are going to have a bunch of them sitting around on earth even if the return journey is slower and preparing for the next flight takes some time i estimate each one will have around months where it is not needed for the mars project spacex will want to put these to use somehow im guessing well see a moon base or orbitalasteroid projects or space tourism as a side benefit of mars because bfs will be available to rent out the first trip to mars is special because there is no existing depot of fuel to supply an immediate return but by the same token there probably wont be fuel for local jaunts maybe by the time the second bfs arrives there will be enough fuel to return them both to earth and have a local jaunt but that seems like a lot of fuel if you have a bfs on mars then it is available to use in an emergency but if you have the fuel to return it to earth thats always going to be the more economic option
spacex,not_removed,the atmosphere is far too thin solar recharging is also not really effective since the number of panels required gets exorbitant youd drive for a couple hours and spend the rest of the day charging
spacex,not_removed,might it be possible to make a purpose designed long range solarbattery rover only if you are willing to go very very slow you could have battery swap stations along the road on regularly travelled routes nasa is planning on rovers with a capabity of more than distance they assume a radius around their base reachable with need to travel twice as many km per direction because of obstacles and of course back again
spacex,not_removed,i have no firm opinion but i am not sure a its that has been on mars for years or more is safe to fly back there is no refurbishing facility on mars for a long time
spacex,not_removed,sorry i wrote payload mass when what i meant was vehicle mass fixed
spacex,not_removed,its widely viewed that in a thousand years human activity on mars will have increased the air pressure and temperature sufficiently that liquid water can exist on the surface thats part of the terraforming we need to do to make mars livable without protective equipment theres enough water on mars to cover the entire surface of the planet to a depth of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwateronmars
spacex,not_removed,high altitude thin air yes but airbreathing burning the oxygen from the thin air
spacex,not_removed,it wouldnt shock me in the slightest if all the rockets teslas hyper loops and solar panels were directly for the benefit of mars fun fact the pressure in a hyper loop tube is almost exactly the same as the surface of mars
spacex,not_removed,why bother with all that just use railways similar to what we use now on earth a hyper loop cant shift the tonnage anyway normal trains run in every hostile environment on earth and can move heavy loads second only to ships which arent an option on mars fast trains already have body shells to take impacts from abrasive matter at speed
spacex,not_removed,i think that depends on when where and what youre doing mars does get comfortably warm during the day at the equator it can be up to c under these conditions if you were doing hard labor like walking kilometers in your suit and dragging that sled you would depend on cooling most of the time it gets cold and at night it gets really cold even at the equator it gets down to as low as c at night under those conditions i would be surprised if even heavy exertion can keep up with heat loss to the air
spacex,not_removed,building trains on mars is a very long term plan there is no need until multiple cities and resource mining operations are there at that point trains would be fantastic on mars there is enough gravity to keep them on the tracks and very little air resistance a high speed train would be easy its practically like having an open hyperloop tube a train would have very different design constraints though they may not need anything like an external heat sink they may be powered via the track itself like many electric trains on earth a high speed train would have enough air running through a radiator to make it effective
spacex,not_removed,what about a train using its rails as a heat sink there isnt a very good thermal pathway between the rails and the train its just the tiny contact patch on the wheels and adding an extra heat transfer surface would cause more drag i think youre better off just using a radiator
spacex,not_removed,id say about the same the locomotive is loosing just as much traction because of lower gravity
spacex,not_removed,or you can take a hybrid approach steel rails to carry the weight aluminum induction rail in the center for linear induction motors to pull the train along this also solves the contact patch problem that you have with traditional traction motors applying their torque through the wheels in a lowg environment
spacex,not_removed,why cant maglev shift bulk freight what sort of maintenance is required for maglev in an environment with nearzero humidity honest questions id like to know more about this
spacex,not_removed,maglev is high maintenance and cant shift bulk freight such as from a mine im not sure about that modern induction maglev systems require only a dumb aluminum roadway the bigger problem is energy loss induction maglev uses about wkgf levitated making it unfavorable compared to the rolling resistance of rails
spacex,not_removed,clearly youve never driven in the northern or central parts of canada once you have the freeze up the road turns to concrete and is a lot more stable than it is in the summer are they insane when driving at those speeds sure but they often do
spacex,not_removed,esas emily lud here we go great spot because thats a quality blog thanks i cannot wait for spx to announce their mars rover for water collection for isru fuel production
spacex,not_removed,esas emily ludsomething sorry emily lakdawalla of the planetary society a very knowledgeable lady
spacex,not_removed,i havent looked too much into it i figure you could make them from a type of paraaramid plastic like kevlar im still researching what materials are more likely or less likely to be able to be mass produced on mars but kevlar is top of my list to research reason we could build a space elevator on mars using kevlar
spacex,not_removed,also even longer runs its probably easier to just have shallower bends no land owners to weave around
spacex,not_removed,true maybe the solution is to create a light vehicle with big ballast containers that can be filled with sand and rocks to improve traction
spacex,not_removed,you cant let the fate of the entire colony ride on a success rate of a single launch every time you need new water the its system depends on a reliability rate way above
spacex,not_removed,as i understand it colonising mars is only economically possible if the bfs returns to earth the same synod that it left thats the reason for the fast journey times robert zubrin has a point there with cargo it seems more effective to transport slowly than fast even it it cuts the reuses in half largely because less fuel needs to be produced on mars not so with passengers you cannot increase the number of passengers by going slow
spacex,not_removed,the first trip to mars is special because there is no existing depot of fuel to supply an immediate return but by the same token there probably wont be fuel for local jaunts think for a moment about the logistics of fuel lox and tanks tanks are big heavy and not easily manufactured on mars until you have a steel or aluminum industry the first unmanned bfs that lands on mars will have to serve as storage tanks for the second bfs which should be manned and which should return to earth the heat shield of the first bfs might be damaged by landing on unprotected ground with loose rocks and sand instead of a prepared smooth landing field engine damage is possible also so the first one will have to stay until a local tank producing industry gets going i dont like the idea of using the first bfs for hops because if you lose it or it gets stranded away from the fuellox plant then the whole mars colony is in jeopardy but according to the charts in this post the first bfs could make some short roundtrip hops so long as it is back next to the fuellox plant in time for it to store enough fuel etc for the second bfs return journey
spacex,not_removed,if only elon had experience in designing fast battery recharge stations
spacex,not_removed,only if you are willing to go very very slow yes but this is for net trip time the rover could make each leg with a fully charged battery quickly a solarbattery rover that can travel a long distance deploy the solar panels and then return could have great value send a small team to a remote site do a bunch of prospecting and sample collection while the rover recharges then return there are a lot of areas on mars that are hard to reach with spacecraft that we will want to check out areas at high altitude for example where the atmosphere never gets dense enough for any current lander to reach
spacex,not_removed,do you have the source that says theyre planning on rovers that capable sounds interesting
spacex,not_removed,only if you are willing to go very very slow can you explain why this is the case custom designed vehicles on earth can maintain upwards of under ideal solar power of course a mars rover is obviously going to be heavier due to being pressurized tougher and carrying life support and payload but the lower gravity and air resistance has to count for something if that graph about the model x performance on mars is in the ballpark of being right then optimistically it looks like you could maintain on flat fairly smooth dirt for is it really that crazy to install a solar array on a rover i totally agree with the supercharger highway being a better pick once you have semiregular traffic i was more thinking really early supply runs and scouting missions
spacex,not_removed,dont have to put people on board
spacex,not_removed,i suppose my question in regard to that would be that if we already know theres that much water there why is finding water still newsworthy
spacex,not_removed,okay that makes sense
spacex,not_removed,why well ultimately it depends on the speed requirements and relative cost hyperloop vs rail for short distances or journeys where trip time doesnt matter a railway might make sense a hyperloop is probably easier to construct though since it can be built on pylons from prefab sections rather than leveling the rightofway or making chicanes ramps etc excavating laying down a gravel railbed railways are a lot more work than just rails and ties mostly boring earthmarswork that most people ignore or forget about a hyperloop on mars would only require as many pylons since all weights are only that of earth and the tube would be a lot thinner so the steel requirements are a lot lower bridges would be easier since a hyperloop track has less loadedmasspermeter tube pod vs track train the hyperloop is smaller in diameter so tunneling is also easier either a hyperloop is easiercheaper to build permile than a railway musks claim or it isnt and the conditions on mars make constructing a hyperloop easier and dont seem to change the fundamentals of railway construction very much
spacex,not_removed,normal trains run in every hostile environment on earth and can move heavy loads second only to ships which arent an option on mars railways will have problems with traction on mars they already have problems on earth and can navigate only slight slopes it will be much harder on mars hyperloop would not have that problem hyperloop has a lot lower throughput unless many pods can be connected to trains like railways but on mars there would be no need to have very high throughput like on earth for a long time
spacex,not_removed,under those conditions i would be surprised if even heavy exertion can keep up with heat loss to the air are you accounting for the fact that the mars atmosphere is only the density it is on earth i think most of your heat loss will be to radiation not conduction into the atmosphere and radiation is easy to cut down on mli etc
spacex,not_removed,i was thinking as a way to link any remote mining site back to the main base rovers would struggle to shift the tonnage and there are no oceans to ship across the alternative is a highway system with hordes of semi trucks which is ludicrously wasteful and high maintenance for anything but short distances
spacex,not_removed,interesting observation i wonder how the low gravity would affect the rest of the train as well stability wise or cars for that matter substantially less air resistance than normal and lower gravity so previous desgin assumptions get tossed out the window airlock
spacex,not_removed,that presumes youre using standard traction motors and applying the torque through the wheels given marss lower gravity environment this would be silly youd be much better off using linear induction motors to directly apply the force to a central rail lims are extremely reliable no moving parts vancouvers skytrain mki cars are still on their original motors from
spacex,not_removed,its about tolerances and energy use the maglev spends energy hovering that a train uses to go forward the system is also much compicated the heavier the load the more power spent hovering rail is steel on steel on earthworks you and run hundreds of tons on it fairly trivialy two steel rails pinned to regolith sleepers i could maintain that with a hammer crowbar and wrench simplicity really is a huge advantage
spacex,not_removed,not experienced in magnetic levitation but my first concern would be weight bearing capacity and my second concern would be resource consumption a loaded httpwwwbnsfcomcustomersequipmentcoalcars while ive been unable to locate reliable sources the general internet consensus seems to point to tonnes loaded for maglev trains now certainly these could certainly be redesigned to accommodate bigger heavier cars but the construction of new lines would be extremely resource intensive for a developing colony without access to the wealth of processed and raw materials we have today on earth however two steel rails staked into the desert floor that is easily manageable right from the getgo additionally httpsenwikipediaorgwikimaglevenergyuse when they are going slow they just burn energy to stay afloat
spacex,not_removed,my general take on it rail is best over long distances rail is usually fairly inert lay the rails on a good base and theyll last awhile with no effort maglev involves active equipment over the full distance when of rail go from inert and good for decades between services to active equipment potentially failing and requiring service at any time big increase in maintenance needs
spacex,not_removed,why cant maglev shift bulk freight i assume it can it just becomes more difficultexpensive to maintain proper levitation when carrying hundreds of tons of ore as opposed to people
spacex,not_removed,even with a dumb right of way a magnetic system is far higher maintenence than traction motors
spacex,not_removed,i feel bad
spacex,not_removed,seems to me that batteries would be a very useful ballast they need to be brought in from earth but aside from that they have many advantages
spacex,not_removed,during the first flights it wont be able to have that high of a rate when launching from mars from earth everything can be controlled but from mars there wont be the facilities there are on earth refurbishing will be hardimpossible and every flight causes the risk to go up a little bit later on that can be solved but at that point we will have enough infrastructure to just put roads everywhere so it will no longer be needed
spacex,not_removed,i agree for expeditions scientific or prospecting they would be stationary for much of the time and can recharge in that period not very suitable suitable for transport of goods or people between settlements
spacex,not_removed,areas at high altitude for example where the atmosphere never gets dense enough for any current lander to reach landers coming from orbit or from interplantary space cannot reach high altitude locations on mars because they need atmospheric braking these places can be reached by the its doing short suborbital hops
spacex,not_removed,i watched a lot of their workshop on selecting a landing site streamed live the rover capabilities were one of the issues discussed there with emphasis on this is the plan today we do not know what the plan will be tomorrow they were also expecting to have rovers that would go on a long trip together with only short excursions in the target area separately so that if anything goes wrong with one rover they still have the second one to keep the crew safe
spacex,not_removed,custom designed vehicles on earth can maintain upwards of under ideal solar power of course a mars rover is obviously going to be heavier due to being pressurized tougher and carrying life support and payload but the lower gravity and air resistance has to count for something mass is much more important than weight so yes mars gravity accounts for something but not as muchas people might think also there would not be a smooth asphalted level road off road conditions increase roll resistance a hard flat surface is not what you will find everywhere is it really that crazy to install a solar array on a rover if you ask it this way then the answer is yes no offence intended much better to have rollable light weight solar arrays that can be deployed to recharge the batteries if you want to go without resources along the way btw tire area is tricky too you need traction especially if the terrain is not totally level
spacex,not_removed,probably the way oil is newsworthy here having it in the right place for the extraction right price until the planet supports liquid water its a hard slog to get and process it into lox more so than dipping a pipe in an ocean
spacex,not_removed,either a hyperloop is easiercheaper to build permile than a railway musks claim or it isnt there are different properties to different systems hyperloop is fast if we believe elon musk i tend to believe him but trains can transport a lot more people or cargo than hyperloop
spacex,not_removed,a hyperloop is super specialised to a single task that being to move small numbers of people ludicrously quickly over short distances railways can do quite a bit more than that i know they are quite a bit of work but they also have verry generous tolerances compared to a hyperloop if you want to say bring the material from a mine back to base a railway is the best thing possible mars its also better for moving large numbers of people and their gear if is acceptable it can be done with centre tech
spacex,not_removed,they already have problems on earth and can navigate only slight slopes it will be much harder on mars i believe gradeclimbing ability should be the same on mars as it is on earth the absolute traction is lower yes but the retarding weight is also lower by the same percentage
spacex,not_removed,are you accounting for the fact that the mars atmosphere is thinner than on earth isnt it closer to in places where humans are likely to live wikipedia says – kpa atm
spacex,not_removed,are you accounting for the fact that the mars atmosphere is thinner than on earth yes i am aware of the atmospheric pressure on mars it is in this context not close to thinner atmospheric pressure on the surface is about of earth sea level pressure so youre looking at times thinner thats still a huge difference but nowhere near when there is a temperature differential between body and air of over degrees f even at that low percentage heat loss through conduction will be significant
spacex,not_removed,yes a cargo rail line to mining sites would be a logical system thats still something that wont be a problem for a long time water is the only thing that has to be mined for the early phases and will be needed right away the colony will be located right next to a water supply as soon as local manufacturing past printing with local resources is ready then developing mining operations will be the next step there is a lot of work to be done mapping out resources on mars
spacex,not_removed,how about a overhead cable type systemaerial tramway no wind to deal with and reduced gravity means the towers can be relatively distant from each others
spacex,not_removed,the gauge would likely have to be substantially larger if you wanted to be moving similar masses at similar speeds to trains on earth i would imagine your box cars would have to be a lot stumpier too or be shaped like this edit might be interesting to see a train that requires downforce to operate winged boxcars im not sure how well that would work in an atmosphere that thin anyone
spacex,not_removed,maglev involves active equipment over the full distance induction maglev uses a dumb aluminum plate
spacex,not_removed,how is maintenance far higher induction maglev systems have no moving parts just power electronics inductors and a dumb metal track
spacex,not_removed,they wont send people if the reliability of the vehicle is below not even initially there are enough other factors that drive risk up i agree about lack of refurbishment facilities that is a reason not to do it that way initially they will have plenty to explore in a range of a few that can be done with rovers later capabilities increase and we dont know in what direction they will expand
spacex,not_removed,not very suitable suitable for transport of goods or people between settlements yes in the case of transport between settlements a supercharger type station makes way more sense it doesnt necessarily need to be a battery swap though waiting for just a few hours to charge isnt a big deal superchargers that are closed loop with solar charging powerpacks are already planned for earth the idea is sound and not all that difficult for mars compared to the massive utility value a transport network between cities would be
spacex,not_removed,i would love to see a circumnavigation of mars in rovers rather than hopping to the other side on its it is about km make that km with detours first test the reliability of the rovers near the base and then send at least when you need for crew so can fail and for transport of supplies with days that would be an average of maybe driving at night recharging and exploring by day should be doable with very good maps from orbital photography
spacex,not_removed,yes this was my original thought for the value of suborbital hops but the fuel cost is just so high that i doubt it ever happens every load of fuel for a spacecraft is equivalent to an entire load of cargo that could have been delivered power for fuel production is going to be a likely bottleneck for a while
spacex,not_removed,unlike landers that use parachutes its can reach higher altitudes using supersonic deceleration but at a high payload penalty the problem with its is it needs infrastructure on the ground to get off again so not a very suitable system for exploring multiple locations unless you do suborbital hops with enough fuel for return an interesting concept but i dont see it that much more useful than rover expeditions at distances where they can return
spacex,not_removed,no offence intended none taken i was genuinely curious thanks
spacex,not_removed,nice meltdrill a pipe down deep until the ice above you weighs enough then you can melt a pocket and keep it under pressure so you can have liquid water mars surface temperature and pressure being pretty much waters triple point so liquid water would be hard on mars maybe even put your equipment down there rad shielded by meters of solid ice maybe even live and work at a humantolerable °c i can see how a big chunk of cleanish ice is really useful
spacex,not_removed,but trains can transport a lot more people or cargo than hyperloop this is indeed the conventional wisdom around here but im not so sure certainly thats true of the hyperloop design reference implementation as specified in the alpha paper im just not convinced that extends to the hyperloop concept in general especially when the engineering tradeoff are rebalanced for mars eg by making the tube larger in diameter thanks to the lower ambient pressure from a physics perspective the hyperloop seems to be strictly superior to a conventional train it greatly reduces the primary loss pathways aerodynamic drag rolling resistance and energy lost to braking there are also some fun engineering tricks that can be played to increase the speed even more eg filling the tube with a lifting gas like water vapor which conveniently cools the axial compressor and can be pumped out merely with a condensationdeposition apparatus the switch to induction maglev from the air skis is also a necessary improvement on the alpha design a hyperloop sized up to accommodate standard shipping containers seems to be the way to go for cargo transport imo hyperloop one is working on this avenue
spacex,not_removed,merely restating your opinion isnt very persuasive
spacex,not_removed,it is about mass and that does not change weight is lower and that makes it harder to get traction
spacex,not_removed,yes
spacex,not_removed,when there is a temperature differential between body and air of over degrees f even at that low percentage heat loss through conduction will be significant but is it significant when compared to radiation losses radiative heat transfer has a similar temperature or even a colder heatsink if radiative losses dominate then thats what drives the the engineering decisions you need enough thermal insulation and active heat management to deal with the total heat flux not just the radiative or conductive portion of heat transfer radiative heat transfer is easy to calculate but im still looking up the equations that govern conductiveconvective heat transfer into an arbitrary fluid
spacex,not_removed,yes a cargo rail line to mining sites would be a logical system it depends on the amount of material transported a rail system requies large qantities to be economical a society with million people may not require that much of raw materials i am thinking of dirt road and something like the australian road trains httpsenwikipediaorgwikiroadtrain for traction they would need multiple axles with motors suitable for electric drives without rain those roads would be easier to maintain it is quite easy to make them fully robotic
spacex,not_removed,this or as there is no rain to deal with and no cattle wild animals to cross them the tracks themselves may carry the power
spacex,not_removed,for people only over short distances of horrible terain those are awesome for heavy loads like say ore from a mine not so much
spacex,not_removed,edit might be interesting to see a train that requires downforce to operate winged boxcars im not sure how well that would work in an atmosphere that thin anyone maybe magnetic downforce applied when necessary but i dont know how feasible it would be
spacex,not_removed,well that would make it much easier
spacex,not_removed,because the alternative is a dumb metal track period it can be maintained with a hammer and wrench maglev requires an active track for the entire length a traction motor can operate anywhere there is a metal track even if the track has sustained some damage and when the metal track is damaged if youre using a traction motor you can simply use the good sections of the rail to transport the materials needed to repair the bad sections same with construction its hard to bootstrap a maglev system its trivial to bootstrap using traction engines because you can immediately use the tracks you lay down to transport the materials needed to build the next section
spacex,not_removed,i worry that on the very first landing that the its rocket falls over i picture the propulsive landing digging a pit under the nozzles and legs as it comes down later marscrete landing pads will be provided assuming the rocket plume isnt hot enough to melt the sulphur
spacex,not_removed,it is going to be an engineering decision batteries like most everything are more valuable on mars than on earth first loading a battery in the recharging station then transferring the charge to another battery in the rover costs both energy and cycles in the batteries swapping batteries may be the better solution a third option would be no batteries at the charging station only a very large solar array maybe a good option with a lot of traffic
spacex,not_removed,the geology you could do on such a trip would make it worthwhile university grants national geographic and the smithsonian institution should all be willing to chip in
spacex,not_removed,a little calculation insolation on the surface might be near the equator at noon which would give up to and would need of perfectly clean solar panels for less if not at noon and the sun comes in at an angle
spacex,not_removed,the biggest reason for lower throughput would be the small size of single pods there needs to be a safety distance between pods severely limiting throughput unless as i already mentioned they could link pods together physically or logical in a chain that could drastically increase throughput i have no idea though if that would be possible
spacex,not_removed,your proposal requires theoretical tech to build something that has low throughput and low payload a railway is one of the most proven technologies we have some have been running for yearsit really isnt that hard to build ive worked on them i can fix a railway with a digger and a hammer unless you have two cities a medium distance apart hyperloop has no advantages prefab towers need foundations perfect alignment for the speeds you propose and as yet unknown compressor tech which is going to eat every bit of fod imaginable
spacex,not_removed,yes but that all scales too electric multiple units have rather excellent traction even when unladen or in icy condition and mars is going to be all electric anyway
spacex,not_removed,it is about mass and that does not change this changes the acceleration not gradeclimbing ability weight is lower and that makes it harder to get traction weight is lower and that means less traction is needed to climb a grade
spacex,not_removed,if you are climbing a grade at the torque required to maintain your velocity would be times as much as it would be with the tractive force and the force needed to maintain speed on a slope both scale linearly with gravity so maximum slope is independent of the amount of gravity if you want to accelerate your train under it is more difficult than with because the force needed to accelerate is the same
spacex,not_removed,first i want to say that i didnt intend this to be a debate over which source of heat loss is more significant i was speaking about how much heat will be lost to the atmosphere because thats what i considered variable within whatever suit design they have the radiation shouldnt vary because of the surrounding environment now that youre digging i would love to know actual numbers for just how much heat loss there is from both sources perhaps mars wont really be all that difficult thermally to survive on
spacex,not_removed,it depends on the amount of material transported a rail system requies large qantities to be economical a society with million people may not require that much of raw materials i do not agree with the assessment that this will translate to a mars colony the same way it has existed on earth the nature of building a new civilization from scratch is very different the whole planet will be a planned development the colonists can decide that the value of a planetary high speed train network is high enough before it already has a direct business case the entire colonization effort follows that idea a high speed rail system would be so well suited for mars with the smaller planet size low density atmosphere no bodies of water or ecosystems to cross and no current infrastructure there is only a need to directly connect major sites there arent any populations scattered across the planet to feed into the rest of the infrastructure the need for resources will also not scale the same way as it has on earth expansion of the colonization will require materials at a far higher rate since everything is constrained by human manufacturing efforts i will give you that large scale ground transport such as road trains have a strong case for a lot of places on mars i just dont think that trumps the use for high speed rail between major sites a planet with high population mobility using trains to any city on the planet will be very appealing long term rail is also the ideal solution for global transport since aircraft are not practical
spacex,not_removed,cool now were back to maglev however more magpull as inverted maglev which keeps the train on the wheels maybe those electro magnets can be tilted a bit so your done with propulsion as well no locomotive so no real maximum train length interesting how a little atmosphere and gravity change leads to fundamentally different designs maybe rollercoaster type connections to the track or monorails for rough terrain the distance between pillars can be bigger with lower gravity
spacex,not_removed,worked ok on the ooho scale triang hornby railway set i had as a kid permanent magnet fixed between one pair of wheels made them stick to the track nicely coaches still derailed if you went round the corner too fast but the loco stayed upright scaling up to full size may be a problem of course
spacex,not_removed,a traction motor can operate anywhere there is a metal track can operate where theres not a track too if there are tracks theyd be useful for many vehicles not just trains
spacex,not_removed,thats part of the reason why the first its will be unmanned it will be an essential test and it will bring robot equipment to build a good landing pad cleared of rocks my fear is that the first manned its will have its heat shield damaged by flying debris on landing i think this is a near certainty for the very first unmanned landing
spacex,not_removed,you raise good points i think its likely that the complexity of the machinery for a battery swap makes it unlikely to be the most ideal option that itself requires mass as well and adds an extra maintenance item i think the most important thing in this discussion is to consider at what point in the timeline of colonization decisions happen very early years there is one colony site any additional hardware not located at the base site is going to be minimal and fall into the prospectingscientific expedition category batteries and solar panels will both be at a premium for building the base power for fuel production is one of the largest bottlenecks to expansion of the colony the more fuel the more flights per synod can bring people and cargo any diverted energy has to be essential after some period of time the initial base will be fairly well built up not a city but a large functioning base there still wouldnt be a logical reason to split resources into a second site yet in this period some way to extend rover distance to key sites for resources may be justified but it wouldnt be anything like a full supercharger way station thats still a lot of critical resources to be assigned to a secondary purpose only at the timeline of a second colony site and a large first site do i think allocating significant resources to extended travel infrastructure make sense manufacturing at the main site can be using materials mined from locations elsewhere on mars and intercity transport becomes highly valuable i think this point is likely at least ten years into manned mars presence even under the best case scenarios i do think all early rovers will come with at least a small deployable solar array for emergency use even something that is just enough to power life support long enough for a rescue rover would be worth having
spacex,not_removed,there is one other issue with the martian supercharger network idea as well the minutes you are waiting for a charge is extra time you are basically stranded in the middle of nowhere with no habitat available should the roverssuit environment fail they may want to add survival habs at each enroute charging station
spacex,not_removed,and if you average that out over say the middle hours of the day its closer to not sure why i didnt simply do the area calculation for considering i explained to someone else earlier today that solar power on mars is nearly as good as on earth in good weather with figures to make a point deployable solar definitely the way to go with regards to scouting missions with that sort of area requirement and definitely not ideal for cargo transport with that figure in mind
spacex,not_removed,the curvature of the track is small so theoretically a loooong hyperloop pod again shipping container size should improve the throughput making the pods longer also means the axial compressor uses less energy per unit of payload moved multiple pods in a train need multiple compressors needed to overcome the kantrowitz limit
spacex,not_removed,your proposal requires theoretical tech to build something that has low throughput and low payload by low throughput and low payload are you saying that there is some factor that prevents the hyperloop design from scaling prefab towers need foundations perfect alignment for the speeds you propose rail beds need preparation too but the foundations on the hyperloop only require construction on of the total length vs of the total length for a railbed i dont think the hyperloop foundation is as hardexpensive as a prepared railbed and as yet unknown compressor tech which is going to eat every bit of fod imaginable its hardly unknown the pressure inside the hyperloop was chosen so that it can use proven mechanical vacuum pumps vs the turbomolecular pumps or cryopumps needed for lower pressures the compressor is pumping out of the hyperloop tube a controlled environment i would put a filter on the pump outlet regardless but it shouldnt be exposed to a lot of fod from the mars environment
spacex,not_removed,it does not scale getting traction is harder by a factor of almost so you must spend that much more engineering to get the same traction if you want to call that scale then do
spacex,not_removed,if you are climbing a grade at the torque required to maintain your velocity would be times as much as it would be with the tractive force and the force needed to maintain speed on a slope both scale linearly with gravity exactly so maximum slope is independent of the amount of gravity if you want to accelerate your train under it is more difficult than with because the force needed to accelerate is the same also true you cannot design a system assuming constant speed it must have the ability to stop and start so the traction must be there to do that the ability to maintain a constant speed is not enough
spacex,not_removed,fair enough ill try and tone down the pedantry here this is a good place to start for mars suit design as far as the calculations anyone happen to have the kinematic viscosity of the mars atmosphere handy
spacex,not_removed,there will probably be multiple unmanned landings in the same window as the first manned landing should have at least one good one for a return trip also depending on how long the first people are planning on staying there could be years to figure out how to get them home
spacex,not_removed,not sure why i didnt simply do the area calculation for considering i explained to someone else earlier today that solar power on mars is nearly as good as on earth in good weather with figures to make a point i would agree with that on average over a year solar on mars is quite good can compete with most places on earth
spacex,not_removed,by low throughput and low payload are you saying that there is some factor that prevents the hyperloop design from scaling yes try putting ore cars down a hyperloop rail can do that without a sweat rail beds need preparation too but the foundations on the hyperloop only require construction on of the total length vs of the total length for a railbed i dont think the hyperloop foundation is as hardexpensive as a prepared railbed railbed is shallow a pylon requires excavation excavations deeper than require shoring this might be more generous on mars more complex isnt actually that unreasonable in a built up area like california the hyperloop has the added advantage of land acquisition but on mars you can just drive a bulldozer the whole length to grade it its hardly unknown the pressure inside the hyperloop was chosen so that it can use proven mechanical vacuum pumps vs the turbomolecular pumps or cryopumps needed for lower pressures then you have all the complexity of the pipe vs two steel rails the compressor is pumping out of the hyperloop tube a controlled environment i would put a filter on the pump outlet regardless but it shouldnt be exposed to a lot of fod from the mars environment how are you loading and unloading the thing for anything more than passengers you surely must expose it also in a hyperloop every car needs a full drive train even a distributed traction train is just two axles and two motors on each car hyperloop also lacks a design for junctions its point to point where as rail can form a global network on a world without oceans
spacex,not_removed,you would be carrying three times as much with the same motors
spacex,not_removed,just use the value for about x pa s the variation with temperature is negligible and the influence of other gases can be neglected because these values are so similar between all gases air on earth is in the same ballpark
spacex,not_removed,is coming to town in all seriousness though december is always such a good time for spacex because of their first crs contract that saved the company and the first landing and hopefully now the first falcon heavy launch slim chance but at least there are rumours
spacex,not_removed,great now elon musk will delay xmas
spacex,not_removed,so the fh launch got delayed again dont remember hearing about that
spacex,not_removed,arent ranges shutdown during holidays like this i remember that maybe a year ago a crs mission got delayed because of highbeta angle of the iss combined with the range being shutdown on christmas
spacex,not_removed,fh is still being kept at perpetual friedman unit length away months there is no basis to think that has changed

spacex,not_removed,news some news at last
spacex,not_removed,where is that bot when se need it
spacex,not_removed,im tempted to call this httpswwwgooglecomausearchqclickbait because originating from twitter there is no content behind it who said why however i guess it isnt and people are just beginning a conversation based on a tweet and im excited and a little frustrated the fans have waited so long but if its longer then so be it can anyone provide more detail or should we just ignore threads until theres something official
spacex,not_removed,think its fair to say that spacex development projects are chained together in other words they aim to complete one project before they need the tech for a more advanced project good example would be mastering stage landings and reuse before they begin falcon heavy flights no point throwing away three cores if you dont have to most gto payloads can be handled by falcon so falcon heavy is mostly needed for mars red dragon no doubt theyd like to practise fh launches and recovery a few times before the first red dragon flight in may so a december demo launch would be ideal a one year lead time might seem like plenty but they probably have to also complete development of their raptor upper stage for fh and any other mods to convert a dragon into red dragon december is looking more and more likely if they want to squeeze all that in before may
spacex,not_removed,the timing is right anyway
spacex,not_removed,im sure the workers families will appreciate that
spacex,not_removed,yeah when we see flight hardware for fh then ill know were getting somewhere until then all these dates are pointless
spacex,not_removed,well technically they have a hangar with cores in it that i believe are launch ready omg i would lose my shit if the maiden launch of falcon heavy was with recycled cores edit im an idiot
spacex,not_removed,given spacexs history assume delays until you see it off the pad
spacex,not_removed,is it a delay when the only people calling it that are somewhat hysterical fans and sometimes the sensationalist press or is it rather a revised net not earlier than launch schedule net in other words not considering launching before a certain date for a multitude of reasons that we are not privy to one of which is changing priorities and adjusted strategies eg launches and recovery are currently our focus i would love to see rspacex be the most professional community rather than just fans of spacex yammering about delays because we dont get to see a launch we foolishly marked as a fixed launch date in our mental calendars does not fit that description imo sure a potential date for launch apparently has slipped but that does not mean its necessarily a delay notice the difference in semantics
spacex,not_removed,the orbcomm launch was on the of december so there must be some margin at least in the lead up to christmas
spacex,not_removed,short answer no longer answer kindof if spacex or anyone else wants to launch i bet there are things they have to do like paying time and a half for working on holidays and trying to get range personnel there might also be a challenge that they have to work around
spacex,not_removed,yeah how many years has it been months away for now
spacex,not_removed,at least what has now been spotted in the wild maybe we can bring it down to months p
spacex,not_removed,nah man these are better they are rumors
spacex,not_removed,exactly people should know by now that everytime you speculate about an exact date it gets pushed back by a month
spacex,not_removed,most gto payloads can be handled by falcon so falcon heavy is mostly needed for mars red dragon i think the main intended market for falcon heavy are us national security payloads the us military might also be interested in the fast relaunch capability of reflown boosters theres strategic value in being able to launch with just a few weeks of headsup should any particular geopolitical area escalate unexpectedly
spacex,not_removed,i doubt well see raptor on falcon or falcon heavy for several years if ever it isnt needed for red dragon
spacex,not_removed,invite all the people to watch the launch rocket party
spacex,not_removed,from what i hear about working at spacex i doubt the workers see their families much anyway it appears one has to be very dedicated to work at spacex
spacex,not_removed,i think that would be amazing now that theyve said theybare just doing a mass simulator i think doing a demonstration of falcon heavy on a beo trajectory would be pretty sweet a direct gso insertion actually probably not gso but a graveyard orbit because of the space junk aspect would probably be more valuable as a capability demonstration but a moon shot would be way cooler
spacex,not_removed,exceedingly unlikely but would absolutely make the year if it happened too exciting to think about
spacex,not_removed,can it achieve a free return trajectory without a long coast it may even be recoverable another wheel of cheese
spacex,not_removed,i still laugh hysterically whenever i hear someone say punt in reference to spacex because when spacex decided to scrub one of the launches after a few tries already elon tweeted that they were punting to the end of the week to try again for weather his twitter lingo cracks me up cheers
spacex,not_removed,there were all those pictures of a second first stage outside hawthorne when showed up back from florida lots of people seemed to think that the beefed up octaweb and attachment points showed that it was at least a falcon heavy test article
spacex,not_removed,while the date may be pointless in the end that does not stop people wanting to keep it from slipping to the next year with it already slipping to later in the year the christmas time frame is about as late as you can get and not admit that it will not happen this year i do not doubt they would push it back further if really not ready though that people would attempt to make the launch happen before the end of the year is not a surprise
spacex,not_removed,allegedly they put fh on hold to catch up on their post– backlog for all we know there are no technical blockers just spacex putting paying customers first
spacex,not_removed,falcon cores are not interchangeable with falcon heavy cores
spacex,not_removed,given any aerospace company when spacex had to take a break after i started following ariane ula etc as well their launches slip just as often by a few days to multiple weeks and their innovationdevelopment programs get delayed even more theyre just less vocal about it and less criticized because the public doesnt watch them as closely as they do spacex
spacex,not_removed,well theyre at least getting a bit better with delays and they havent had a ton of scrubs recently maybe soon they will no longer be scrubx besides nasaspaceflight recently renamed their spacex scrubs thread because spacex was no longer scrubbing almost every launch
spacex,not_removed,well yes but still i wouldnt trust this as the very first thing being heard about the fh delay especially with the specific week
spacex,not_removed,welcome to the world of semantics to you delay apparently has a certain meaning seemingly one with specific conditions the way that i was using it really was nothing more than pushed back with no other intentions obviously though there are connotations for other people youre not going to get nearly people to all understand the lingo with proper usage not to mention i doubt all the professionals would agree with it being a tad passive aggressive and insulting certainly is not a way to be welcoming though without spacex fans spacex wouldnt have a fraction of the buzz around them that they do besides this is already one of the strictest subreddits as far as modding that there is there would be little community left if they removed fans
spacex,not_removed,since late
spacex,not_removed,rumors are unconfirmed news
spacex,not_removed,i think the main intended market for falcon heavy are us national security payloads agree fh provides a good alternative to delta iv heavy particularly with regards to launch cost however most of the militarys ultra heavy payloads are already allotted to ula via their eelv block buy contract so technically falcon heavy wont be required by military until or even hence main driver for fh atm is red dragon theres strategic value in being able to launch with just a few weeks of headsup should any particular geopolitical area escalate unexpectedly it will certainly be a paradigm shift for the military to keep satellites in storage ready to be deployed spontaneously to support strategic needs interesting times
spacex,not_removed,i doubt well see raptor on falcon or falcon heavy for several years if ever heres a quote from to fund raptor work this other transaction agreement requires shared cost investment with spacex for the development of a prototype of the raptor engine for the upper stage of the falcon and falcon heavy launch vehicles raptor probably makes more sense for falcon heavy because it provides the most benefit for those really big payloads like interplanetary missions we might not see raptor on red dragon but the missions which should be groaning with payload in situ resource equipment rovers expandable gardens etc will definitely benefit from that extra kick raptor provides in addition they really need to test raptor on that mars run and as they say sooner the better
spacex,not_removed,best kind of party
spacex,not_removed,cant do a circularization burn at gto apoapsis because the would freeze before it reaches ap
spacex,not_removed,now that theyve said theybare just doing a mass simulator i think doing a demonstration of falcon heavy on a beo trajectory would be pretty sweet pictures of the back of the moon or it didnt happen
spacex,not_removed,yes just a matter of launching at the right time in the right direction they might be able to fund some raptor development by the sale of their wheel of space cheese
spacex,not_removed,absolutely even if it is a structural test article things are moving forward on fh
spacex,not_removed,wow i didnt realize that was a different than normal core cool
spacex,not_removed,side core nose cone test articles composite can be seen on tours in hawthorne i think ive seen three different ones recently also saw a fh test interstage with extra longeron strut holes cut out a couple of months ago
spacex,not_removed,they have paying customers for the fh as well and at least one of them opted for another provider for a payload that was previously scheduled on a fh
spacex,not_removed,however if im not mistaken fh side cores will be the basis for the next version of meaning when they land they can be used as first stages not the center stages though i read this somewhere on this sub i think maybe the quote was something like spacex will move toward having a single production line for and fh side cores not necessarily meaning interchangeables but at least substantially more similar than ft and fh side cores right now
spacex,not_removed,oh i did not know that thanks
spacex,not_removed,yep this is the case with tesla too their delays or quality issues are magnified due to this exact reason
spacex,not_removed,it wasnt that long ago that it was supposed to launch in at vafb then moved to summer then first quarter and now end of the year well end of was announced months ago
spacex,not_removed,welcome to the world of semantics thanks although my meaning was that semantics matter obviously though there are connotations for other people exactly im a little bothered about the mostly emotional connotations and reactions that have little substance like complaining about delays when talking about maiden flights in the space industry even though theyre the absolute norm since i started following spacex sometime in late their slippage has become smaller and smaller disregarding here so kicking off a raft of comments complaining about fh delay really is more noise than signal its not like spacex have a big backlog of missions for it when compared to the being a tad passive aggressive and insulting certainly is not a way to be welcoming though my comment obviously wasnt meant to be the welcoming kind i do that in other comments with the large influx of users we are seeing quite the decline in overall comment quality and sadly a lot of httpsenwikipediaorgwikilawoftriviality aka worse signal to noise ratio not the least because the knowledgeable regulars post even less in noisy threads without spacex fans spacex wouldnt have a fraction of the buzz around them that they do besides this is already one of the strictest subreddits as far as modding that there is there would be little community left if they removed fans thats a strawman argument also the mods dont exist in an ivory tower the modding rules are the result of a community that works to preserve the exceptional quality of discussions found here to some the rules may seem strict to others like me they seem very sensible nobody is talking about removing anybody but sometimes we have meta discussions about the way we discuss welcome to the world of semantics
spacex,not_removed,however most of the militarys ultra heavy payloads are already allotted to ula via their eelv block buy contract so technically falcon heavy wont be required by military until or even well id not expect specific plans to be very solid while not even the maiden flight of the falcon heavy has been demonstrated but the military seems to be seriously interested in the fh for example the first payload launch of the fh will be httpsenwikipediaorgwikispacetestprogramupcomingactivities the dod space test program payload is scheduled to be launched aboard a falcon heavy in march the payload should include an isat innovative spacebased radar antenna technology flight demonstrator satellite massing over kg and a cluster of six satellites massing at kg each if the falcon heavy demonstration flight is a success then id expect a sizable fh launch queue to form quickly
spacex,not_removed,given that the usaf awarded a development contract to spacex for a raptor upper stage for fh i would assume that means the current design is insufficient for something they want to launch what that could be i have no idea but it doesnt make sense for them to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars for something they have no use for
spacex,not_removed,i would say that they will have a prototype but will never go into production they will set up their new production line for the much larger one sure more payload is always great but an upper stage raptor would be so different from the bfemct raptor that they can not reuse most of the production tools if they have to set up two full production lines with the upper stage ones only used in small quantities compared to merlin per launch then i dont think that makes sense in the next couple of years maybe eventually they will phase out the merlins completely and use all raptors that would make some sense
spacex,not_removed,they have said they could do it the current limitation is battery life there would be some upgrades needed possibly insulation for the lox tank to prevent boil off but in the hours it takes to coast to apogee the would supposedly be ok adding some electric heaters to the fuel tank would not be impossible either and wouldnt require tons of weight gso payloads usually have to be small anyway because of the mass requirements to put them there
spacex,not_removed,i havent heard anything about the fate of the cots cheese seems like if it had gone up for auction that would have been big news
spacex,not_removed,employees say its begun to stink
spacex,not_removed,yep viasat just up the road from me switched to ariane
spacex,not_removed,they didnt lose total faith in fh just faith in timing who can blame them at this point they have kept their fh launch option for sending a later bird which im not sure if it was formerly scheduled for ariane or not scheduled yet
spacex,not_removed,if you could provide a source on that thatd be awesome because im interested if ive learned anything in this sub over the past few months its that fh cores cannot be or the reverse period
spacex,not_removed,no worries a lot of people forget falcon heavy is bit more complex than three falcon glued together
spacex,not_removed,goes both ways though spacex tesla routinely get free press coverage for even minor announcements similar to apple but then when something bad happens even if its minor or a rumor it gets amplified as well so you gotta take the good with the bad
spacex,not_removed,if the falcon heavy demonstration flight is a success then id expect a sizable fh launch queue to form quickly there are already six falcon heavy launches on the manifest including the test launch of the six launches only one is for the military
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if they have plans that exceed all current launch capabilities they would sure be impressive plans
spacex,not_removed,maybe eventually they will phase out the merlins completely and use all raptors that would make some sense well that should help relieve coking problem increase isp and generally improve reusability so probably happen sooner or later
spacex,not_removed,it seems very unlikely that raptor will be used on you would only need three engines but they will certainly be too large bell diameter to fit across a diameter core you could just maybe fit them in a triangle but then you would need to use all three engines for landing to balance the thrust and throttle down to for the final landing burn which seems hugely improbable raptor is quite likely for in conjunction with an expansion of the tanks to diameter and perhaps a small length stretch it would be a full size raptor so it can share the mct production line and more importantly give spacex early flight experience with methalox and raptor the usafnro would like this concept because it gives them geo injection with all cryo propellants and the ability to lift more mass into polar and malniya orbits a smaller raptor version fitted to a diameter gains very little performance and negates the advantage of flight testing a full size raptor as you note the production volumes would also be too small to make sense
spacex,not_removed,maybe eventually they will phase out the merlins completely and use all raptors that would make some sense this has to happen at some point right at least raptorderived engines they cant get to full reuse with kerolox and once bfr is flying they would gain by not having to deal with different fuels im thinking well see a fullyreusable falcon replacement mid what say you
spacex,not_removed,its sitting in their foyer as a fun fact the full gallery a lot of misc images you can page back through
spacex,not_removed,how its sealed in an airtight container behind an elevator underneath the stairs do they have fromage maintenance techs now p
spacex,not_removed,sure i was just pointing out that paying customers first isnt a valid reason to delay fh because fh has paying customers and those customers are being affected by the delay
spacex,not_removed,without any source i dont think theres any reason why spacex couldnt consolidate the cores with either the fh side cores or center core it would probably come at a slight payload cost to due to the enhanced structural strength required by fh less so for side cores greater for center cores really boils down to whether the cost savings of a simplified production line and the flexibility of being able to use them interchangeably on reuse flights is greater than the profit impacts of a slightly decreased payload capacity for i would venture to guess that in the long term this is the most cost effective solution any limitations to capacity would only affect payloads close to the upper bounds of mass but production savings would apply on all cores and fh side cores also consider if the costtime to refurbish cores is relatively low and cores are capable of a high enough number of flights that many payloads could be flown on fh with higher fuel margins for a greater chance of safe recovery with minimal damage
spacex,not_removed,gwyne shotwel at the satellite conference in order to launch and get operational with the current falcon that were flying the we needed to draw a line on engine development but what we did see during the development of our merlin engines was that there was more performance to go get but we fundamentally ran out of time we needed to get this vehicle to the pad and fly and make our customer commitments so what weve done is weve gone back got that extra performance from those engines and were going to place them on the new vehicle the new spin i dont know what were going to call it enhanced falcon falcon fullperformance falcon so we got the higher thrust engines finished development on that were in qual what were also doing is modifying the structure a little bit i want to be building only two versions or two cores in my factory any more than that would not be great from a customer perspective its about a increase in performance maybe a little more what it does is it allows us to land the first stage for gto missions on the drone ship
spacex,not_removed,yeah i was having this same conversation a few months ago with someone who had spacex employee flair and they said specifically that they were not interchangeable in any way at the time the wiki was ambiguous but has since been updated with this in addition falcon heavy boosters can not be used separately as a falcon first stage
spacex,not_removed,the production process tools and equipment needed are very similar this makes it efficient but the boosters the products are different the center core is very different because it needs to be a lot stronger but i wonder if they ever will make simple boosters interchangeable with fh side boosters by the time they will recover dozens every year it would make sense to solve compatibility limitations in the far future space hardware needs to work like lego
spacex,not_removed,gwen shotwell i tell my engineering teams cmon it cant be that hard its just three falcon glued together lets move it
spacex,not_removed,there are already six falcon heavy launches on the manifest including the test launch of the six launches only one is for the military please dont ruin my pet theory with hard facts 😀 i still think the military is very interested but is waiting it out they have the most expensive payloads probably by an order of magnitude so booster price is not nearly as much of a factor for them as booster availability reliability and capability but once the falcon heavy flies i think theyll insist on jumping the launch queue and will pay for the privilege and the us military will turn into one of the biggest spacex revenue drivers
spacex,not_removed,remember the orbiting missile base from the sean connery movie meteor that
spacex,not_removed,a smaller version raptor in the center of the triangle for landing burns
spacex,not_removed,im not really sure maybe they could make a smaller raptor and have the same basic setup as they have now with the if you have a rocket you will have problems with landing if you have full sized raptors because you can not throttle them the most logical would seem to be to have two sizes of raptorstyle ffsc and methane engine with each a sea level and vacuum version each if they can get that far until mid seems a bit fast they will have their hands full with the bfrmct the merlins are rolling of the production line and are already extremely cheap and fantastic at what they do it will take quite some time to develop another rocket engine that can beat its price and make it worth to replace the existing production line
spacex,not_removed,long gone from the foyer its visible through a glass wall in the back of the lefthand elevator to the second floor the cylon and iron man are behind the right elevator if you go for a tour and your guide forgets to show these off just ask them
spacex,not_removed,the acrylic top has cracks and i think you can walk in under the stairs since thats how they put it there i havent personally gone there to sniff just look at it does nobody in this sub get regular tours from friendly employees im thinking
spacex,not_removed,true i was just clarifying they didnt totally abandon fhspacex one could argue that has more paying customers but im sure viasat would have preferred they went by order of paying customers
spacex,not_removed,would reduce their landing margins though probably impacting their ability to recover as many cores
spacex,not_removed,thanks for digging that up id have to say thats a pretty reliable petty recent source if there ever were one she says she wants that to happen that doesnt necessarily mean itll happen now or that itll happen at all i mean we see elon tweeting about relaunching back to base from the asds and most of us here find that absolutely unnecessary and infeasible this statement was also made before they had flown and they may have not even completely finished the design yet however something like consolidating cores and fh boosters seems like it could be way more viable than some of the other ideas she and elon have pitched out there im interested in seeing where this goes
spacex,not_removed,they said specifically that they were not interchangeable in any way shotwell is the one that put the information out there that once fh is flying there will only be two core types fh center and booster cores this was a while back so we shall see if its true
spacex,not_removed,making the cores and boosters interchangeable would be like trying to race at nascar with an indy car instead of a stock car the requirements are just a little bit different and its a waste of performance to make a onesize fits all booster
spacex,not_removed,it would work but the whole idea is to only develop one raptor version to keep qualification and manufacturing costs down one crazy idea that might work is to qualify merlin to run on methalox and use it as a landing engine it is relatively light at and the lower isp than raptor is not significant for the final landing burn and we already know you can land a on a single merlin the fuel section of the turbopump would need to be modified for the higher volumetric flow rate but that would be quite achievable but since the motivation is presumably to standardise on a single raptor engine design it does lack consistency you also get to standardise on methalox for both stages but that only helps a little with pad logistics
spacex,not_removed,regular tours from friendly employees those are not exactly easy to get
spacex,not_removed,right i should have acknowledged that more clearly in my comment i think they can address that in a couple ways flying some payloads on fh with easier landings and continued improvements to the landing regime the fh option is contingent on reuse ending up being fairly low cost ie cheap refurbishment quick turnarounds and cores capable of a large enough number of flights before failure improvements to the landing regime theyre working on regardless things such as optimizing the throttling of the engines cutoff times on engine landings more effective use of drag to slow down in the atmosphere etc
spacex,not_removed,reminder spacex is about cost efficiency first and performance second
spacex,not_removed,but im not talking about cores and side boosters being interchangeable also they are the same size
spacex,not_removed,fortunately performance doesnt much matter here fh is hugely oversized for the vast majority of payloads even with reuse and its likely to become even more powerful soon after its debut partial crossfeed and possibly the raptor upper stage spacex is primarily concerned with cost and cutting down to a single production line and needing fewer cores at each launch site would save them a great deal of money and any payload can just be kicked up to fh for minimal extra cost if the beefed up first stage reduces margins too much
spacex,not_removed,good point a right at the edge of margins launch could use a fh with ridiculous margins instead
spacex,not_removed,fh is hugely oversized for the vast majority of payloads to leo less so for higherenergy orbits
spacex,not_removed,still quite a bit bigger than delta iv heavy the only missions fh is too small for are slstype missions
spacex,not_removed,correct me if im mistaken but my understanding is that fh with booster rtls and center core to the droneship is about equal to divh on a gto flight
spacex,not_removed,in that configuration fh should be able to do about tons to gto vs for divh httpsenwikipediaorgwikideltaivheavy
spacex,not_removed,just after bubba built this app we brought it to elon and you can see his first reaction

spacex,not_removed,is there an option for non vr
spacex,not_removed,just tried it on my gear vr its a bit short but great to play
spacex,not_removed,haha classic must be good to see your future baby pictures i hope elon landed it first time awkward if he didnt what vr lenses are on the iphone my googlefu isnt coming up with anything with those hooks
spacex,not_removed,httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcommurarkaliftoffvrhlen
spacex,not_removed,i dont think so its them showing off a capability and choosing spacex as a cool subject matter i cant view it in vr either at the moment but running the iphone app on an ipad gave me the gist of it and you can twist it around to achieve the landing
spacex,not_removed,you can still play it without a vr device i dont have one so j just watch half the screen and still enjoy it but of course now i must google how to getmake a google cardboard damn the landing is so hard
spacex,not_removed,from a fb friend who had two through legitimate circumstances probably not repeatable by other employees maybe there is somebody else who has a box of them under their desk and allows some more to escape unknown if there are even extras being hoarded somewhere
spacex,not_removed,i notice that usaf patches on ebay is now taking images from the spacexpatchlistspace site applying their own watermark and adding them to his ebay store as display items with up to prices
spacex,not_removed,perhaps a in nz part of uechologics collection i think those or at least the one was actually from ebay a while back so another employee must have had at least a couple
spacex,not_removed,why was this deleted it seems like a good question
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if spacex is starting off with a simplified proposal of the launch profile in order the make the talk more accessible but also i wonder if there is really that much to be gained by planning ballistic capture as i naively understand it ballistic capture might buy you more times to leave but it doesnt shorten the overall mission time much if at all when considering the full thereandback especially when isru to generate return fuel is required additionally there are big advantages to be gained from the redundancy of having several ships even just leaving as a fleet to arrive together
spacex,not_removed,post was resubmitted
spacex,not_removed,since spacex currently moves all of the booster stages via truck im guessing that they currently do not have anything setup where the boosters would be able to be transported via rail moving boosters via truck may be an involved process but it is certainly a known process if memory serves spacex is also getting a storage facility together much closer to the port which would significantly reduce the benefit to spacex for rail to move boosters back up to their pads from the port if the pad users are all involved in the route design then it could make it easier to move payloads or assemblies from the port but it probably isnt going to be a direct benefit to spacex edit typo
spacex,not_removed,im not sure itd help much its only a very short distance from port canaveral to ccafs and once on base it shouldnt be much trouble closing roads as they are all private it already travels across country from hawthorne to the cape via mcgregor on public roads so i dont think much time would be saved at this end at least not until they get into full rapid reusability ie booster turnaround and thats probably still years off
spacex,not_removed,its about km from spacexs new building at the port to pad travelling at is a hour journey loading and unloading the booster on a train plus moving it to and from the train loading docks would probably take much longer and be more complex im assuming the rails can go right into the buildings or through the ccafs base
spacex,not_removed,i doubt the actual rockets will ever travel by rail but what about the fuel if spacex ups its launch cadence and starts burning through some serious amounts of i wouldnt be surprised to see it arrive in tank cars
spacex,not_removed,id be willing to wager spacex will land a first stage back at the launch site before the railway is even built getting a special district the port to coordinate with the county brevard and get clearance from nasa the cape is way harder than just landing the rocket back at the launch site after enough precise landings spacex may want to bring a back to the pad as a test for its the railway may be a solution looking for a problem
spacex,not_removed,well they just upgraded a truck to move stages so this has very little relevance for the journey mentioned in the article
spacex,not_removed,spacex is apparently planning to operate a at port canaveral the new article mentions a possible benefit of the railroad to blue origin for their new fabrication facility i believe elon mentioned an intention to fabricate its in florida has there been any word of a location for a fabrication facility would a port canaveral railroad potentially benefit any of these activities

spacex,not_removed,i mean if this is legit moving a rocket by rail would be like quicker than taking it on roads with all those support vehicles clearing the way
spacex,not_removed,the storage facility is extremely close to the south ccafs entrance they wont hold up traffic much there
spacex,not_removed,in fairness the strongback itself runs on rails between the launch pad and the integration facility at and i believe that was also added to i know that isnt the same thing as running on standard gauge rails on the national rail network but spacex definitely runs rockets on rails also the srbs that thiokol now orbitalatk made for the sts were sent to ksc via the national rail transport network it isnt unprecedented for even large rockets although the size of a rail car also influenced the length of each segment in the srbs as well
spacex,not_removed,do they not already use rail cars for fuel i thought i remembered reading somewhere that some rail cars with fuel were some of the damaged items from the amos failure but im not sure about that
spacex,not_removed,the booster already rides the rails between cali texas and florida
spacex,not_removed,after enough precise landings spacex may want to bring a back to the pad as a test for its i agree with your premise but falcon wont likely be landing on the launch mount like its the nature of the vehicle design makes its suited for ultra precise landings i do think youre right that for rapid reusability after they have proven landing accuracy dozens of times they will build a landing pad right next to the launch pad they will need one for the tankers to come back to for its
spacex,not_removed,a new railroad often comes with many private spur tracks between facilities the rocket loaded trucks they use now could drive right on to the railcars at loading points built where you want them yard tractors small locomotives could move them all over the cape easily they could even run on tesla batteries
spacex,not_removed,i would think that welding rail wheels onto a truck would be relatively trivial for spacex to do if they get a rocket back every two weeks in the near future then it might be bad for local traffic to use the road each time
spacex,not_removed,i believe elon mentioned an intention to fabricate its in florida actually he stated during the iac that they were considering building the its all around the gulf states and made no mention of building at the launch site
spacex,not_removed,well not faster but it could be costeffective given the correct design and routing it might be more useful for moving other bulking andor massive stuff
spacex,not_removed,falcon is in diameter but north american loading gauges typically allow only in width the difference is small enough that it could be done on almost all existing commercial rail but it would be a mess of permitting track closures and gauge inspections that would make the highways look simple by comparison
spacex,not_removed,build a rail to the middle of when the booster lands drive the strongback up to it and pick it up with that to move it to processing
spacex,not_removed,do they not already use rail cars for fuel they do you can get a really good look at them in in the lower left and right however from looking at the pad in httpsgooglmapsikzkzncfnev they look to be immobile storage containers their tracks dont go anywhere i thought i remembered reading somewhere that some rail cars with fuel were some of the damaged items from the amos failure but im not sure about that some of the initial reports from the people in the know mentioned these railcars exploding during
spacex,not_removed,nope its transported entirely by road the falcon core diameter was designed as such that it can fit underneath us interstate overpasses they put the first and second stages on their own respective trailers covered in black fabric here are shots of the httpsiimgurcomwkgqhrujpg and httpsimgurcomayqevm edit
spacex,not_removed,i thought a second landing pad was already in the works for fh launches i believe it has been speculated that both of the fh side boosters could rtls in any case the majority of payloads for are bound for gto and rtls is not viable for those launches
spacex,not_removed,the majority of the mile trip is on roads in the port and then the air force base there is hardly any distribution to local traffic at all
spacex,not_removed,thanks id forgotten that detail looking at the httpdiyhpluswikitranscriptsspacexelonmuskmakinghumansamultiplanetaryspecies i think we would probably look at construction of the booster and the spacecraft were actually looking at louisiana as a possibility and i think were going to end up constructing the booster and spacecraft in probably multiple states and then do final assembly at the launch site so it was final assembly at the launch site that i was thinking of with transport of major its components by water that makes five gulf states including alabama and also at least georgia south carolina and north carolina could be feasible all excited about jobs and revenue and potentially willing to offer incentives like the competition for a site for teslas gigafactory and if the components are coming in by water to port canaveral maybe that proposed railroad would come in handy
spacex,not_removed,building it in the gulf would give you barge access to both texas and florida
spacex,not_removed,yea obviously not but i think instead of needing trucks permits etc and people its easily like people to move it
spacex,not_removed,the real issue is not so much the diameter of the first stage but the length your typical railcar is significantly shorter than a first stage when you go around a bend that first stage is going to be overhanging the side of the track on the inside of the bend sometimes significantly this is the same reason why other long bulky objects are also transported by road blades for wind turbines being the first example that comes to mind
spacex,not_removed,you only have to gauge inspection once though
spacex,not_removed,the funny thing about the rails at is that they existed prior to spacex acquiring the launch site spacex was going to be using more of the system they employed for the falcon at omlek island but with the rails already present along with some railroad trucks aka the set of wheels used by railroad cars to move along the tracks the spacex engineers decided to try it out and it worked pretty nicely the need existed anyway to move the rocket from the integration facility to the launch pad and spacex was already used to the idea of horizontal integration as opposed to vertical integration like nasa aka what happens in the vab at ksc and ula do with their rockets a rail to could happen and it could even be the strongback itself for that matter which performs the pickup of the core that would help streamline the processing of the cores as it would be the pickup that attaches the lower core to the strongback similarly the pickup from the ksc canals that happen from the drone ships could also have a rail line getting to them using a similar system
spacex,not_removed,there has been some information about plans for the additional landing pads but as far as we know no work has gone into them i dont expect that one to be to be right at eventually theyll have to add a pad at for its though in the video its directly adjacent to the launch pad so the crane can grab the tanker well see if it ends up really being that close
spacex,not_removed,is hawthorn rail connected sending the raptors by train might be better than by truck having jobs in all the gulf states could turn the pork barrel spend in spacex favour
spacex,not_removed,thats true and it could make sense to do that investment once and see just how much money and trouble the rest of it would be i have no idea how much money would be involved though so they may not want to spend some large amount just to find out how much more they would have to spend for rail shipping my gut feeling is that rail would be more convenient than road but an objective answer to that question doesnt appear to be possible with publicly available information
spacex,not_removed,elon was actually deadset on wheels for a long time if you can wheel an airplane out onto the tarmac why shouldnt you be able to wheel a rocket out onto the pad until employees fought to use the existing rails at the launch site and won
spacex,not_removed,article from july indicated that they were planning to add pads at for fh considering they need to do considerable work to inspect and prepare a flown core for reflight i doubt that the distance between and makes any real difference the concept art for its is cool but i have a suspicion that the final engineered solution wont look exactly like that video i would not read too much in to it
spacex,not_removed,is hawthorn rail connected very much so check out the campus on there are train tracks literally right across the road
spacex,not_removed,i bet they still ship by truck trucking is quite cheap and flexible if the individual hardware was larger maybe rail would be a better fit but each raptor will be similar size to a merlin
spacex,not_removed,hes also known for bringing mostly invalid analogies waay too far again see the airplane reuse analogy
spacex,not_removed,yes i remember the article for the near future i agree the distance makes no difference if they manage to fly at a rate to put up the whole satellite constellation plus other customers then i can see things changing the rapid part of reusability would become critical i and some spacex employees agree that the its video contains some liberties with the crane and ground operations i do think theyll land the tankers close to the pad enough that there wont be any road transport to contend with the its is so much bigger that moving the pieces around cant be handled as simply as with falcon
spacex,not_removed,sometimes i wonder if he really wants to get into the aircraft industry given his analogies and oftmentioned interest in electric vtols
spacex,not_removed,multiple reports that what people are seeing is the transportererector te or tel not a falcon vertical on the pad this posts flair has been updated to reflect that

spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,i have friends that work at the cape ill text and ask
spacex,not_removed,reports it could just be the tel erected
spacex,not_removed,so im being told by a nasa employee that the process of spacex putting the rocket vertical and static firing will not be media accredited by ksc this will make my job a lot harder
spacex,not_removed,great to see operations beginning on the new pad heres hope that everything goes smoothly
spacex,not_removed,remember we thought there was a falcon vertical at lets just hold off until we get more solid confirmation

spacex,not_removed,i wonder if doing tanking tests on an old core is of any consideration i guess in spaceflight however you are fairly certain things will work as planned before trying it but even to avoid any unneeded tanking on echostarss core on the other hand makes good sense to use the core which will be utilizing the pad gse first
spacex,not_removed,is that tel going to support the heavy too or will it get its own tel
spacex,not_removed,forgive me for my ignorance is this going to be the first reused core or is that another mission
spacex,not_removed,can they please stop with the misleading tweets when they tell the truth we wont believe them
spacex,not_removed,thats not been confirmed edit confirmed
spacex,not_removed,yeah that would definitely make sense i see no reason to wait until the static fire to test out gse considering an issue would just cause delay if any issue is found today they can likely fix it before the static fire ensure static fire goes well and we really see a launch on feb i for one have already got my tickets for the hype train
spacex,not_removed,based on normal timelines or do we know static fire is monday
spacex,not_removed,maybe i am not sure about handling a tanking i think they would have to request the range because it involves a risk my guess would be a fit check only see if all connections can be made but not actually filling with propellant it would still help with ensuring a static fire on monday
spacex,not_removed,dumb question but why do they do a static fire
spacex,not_removed,so monday will be the first time a rocket has fired on since wow
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomnasaspaceflight looks like its just the tel erected at the pad again falcon your day will come soon this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,that would be extremly kind of you
spacex,not_removed,i dont think they ever have hosted media for a static fire
spacex,not_removed,do you plan to video the sf
spacex,not_removed,good call it looks like you were right
spacex,not_removed,hold off on what it makes perfect sense for them to test out the on the te before the static fire considering that this is a brand new te
spacex,not_removed,yeah matt travis can be spotty at best for info
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if doing tanking tests on an old core is of any consideration that was the plan but now echostar is ready to go and theyre just going to use the rocket they have ready for launch
spacex,not_removed,it supports falcon heavy
spacex,not_removed,first expected flight tested core is for net check out the sidebar
spacex,not_removed,a nice fresh one after this is another fresh stick flying to the isscrs however ses after is the first flight proven booster exciting times
spacex,not_removed,this is a new expendable booster heavy sat ses coming up will be the first reused booster thanks for asking
spacex,not_removed,this one will be a new core the first reused core is scheduled to fly the mission net
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomnasaspaceflight looks like its just the tel erected at the pad again falcon your day will come soon this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,probably just a mistake i doubt it was malicious from a distance the erector looks falconish
spacex,not_removed,nor is it confirmed to be a falcon people have confused the tel with a falcon many many times before
spacex,not_removed,false alarmjust drove over and no in sight sorry guys the te sticking up over the rotating service structure looks a lot like a rocket from the lcc
spacex,not_removed,spacex likes to test their stuff at each stage they test each engine individually texas test them once they are integrated into the rocket texas via california then when it goes to the pad california or florida so that if there are issues they can repair or swap an engine without delaying the launch and causing issues with their schedule sometimes launches have windows of a few hours but often enough they have a second window like going to the space station if they fail to launch exactly at that second they need to it may have to wait a for another day or even a week or so launches also can get delayed for weather too so any technical fault can compound it i think it was in they had launch delays for one launch cant remember which one now and it took a few weeks to finally get it going in the air once they got the technical and weather problems cleared up since they are going towards a launch rate of one every weeks any delay can have some knock on effects
spacex,not_removed,just looked out the windows of the lcc and they appear to be vertical on pad a this is historic last time a vehicle was there was atlantis on july
spacex,not_removed,i didnt get a reply yet so that means hes busy hes a nasa internal photographervideographer so thats probably what hes doing if its going up
spacex,not_removed,im trying to change that
spacex,not_removed,im sure they werent thrilled about the static fire deflagration video from uslaunchreports getting air time around the world
spacex,not_removed,thats my plan in wonderful on a sony with tack sharp canon l lenses i sent the email out to spacex
spacex,not_removed,the first and second stages are already integrated if a falcon is on the pad its preparing for a static fire why do fit checks one day and a static fire the next when you can do both at once
spacex,not_removed,it was just the te no rocket just like the previous thread he cited
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,by expendable you mean they wont try to land it
spacex,not_removed,thanks for the reply
spacex,not_removed,ths one is much bigger whiter and solid than the old one it definitely looks like a rocket from a distance the old one looked much more like a crane and was far easier to distinguish from the vehicle even at a long distance
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomnasaspaceflight echostar launch on falcon from now early february target moving right every few days based on pad readiness for static fire this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,take a picture from that window
spacex,not_removed,i was looking at the boeing spacesuits yesterday with christopher ferguson wearing one commander and thinking just how special itll be to see this pad used again the only place where humanity has launched from sending us to another celestial body the first and last shuttle launches where from as well a very special to say the least
spacex,not_removed,is there a rocket on the tel
spacex,not_removed,im media myself ill throw in a request today to see if theyll let me out there this weekend to snap a couple pics edit request submitted if they approve ill update edit edit ksc is only accrediting the launch not anything else sent request to spacex
spacex,not_removed,i assume its more about the expense and trouble of crowd management and safety
spacex,not_removed,hopefully you get the shot cant wait to see it
spacex,not_removed,so you can take time to look at data from said tests when you have of sensor channels shit takes time to look at even more so when lots of those new sensor channels are new so you have no real base lines of past go no go
spacex,not_removed,even on a basic level to see if you can even get to the point of static fire simple tanking procedures electrical checkouts etc
spacex,not_removed,so they can check gse is working properly it would behoove them to do that before a static fire so they can work out any issues before they cause another delay
spacex,not_removed,correct
spacex,not_removed,although i believe an expendable booster is any falcon with the legs stripped off its funny how the use of the word suggests that theres something inherent about the booster such that it can be expended versus other boosters that cannot be expended one of the few instances where the paucity of english verb tenses is really striking the distinction that the booster has is that it is to be expended and i suppose we ought to call it an expending booster giving it the agency of its own disposal or else give in and call it an expended booster
spacex,not_removed,im going to drive over there to take a peek in a few minutes the picture from here didnt do justice its hot and hazy here today
spacex,not_removed,the only place where humanity has launched from sending us to another celestial body im sure youre only counting landing on but if were also counting orbiting another celestial body apollo launched from
spacex,not_removed,i agree that would be the optimal path to take im just saying that they dont have time to do that before echostar
spacex,not_removed,so they can check gse is working properly i phrased that poorly i understand why theyd want to do fit checks im just suggesting that the schedule is too tight to allow that
spacex,not_removed,although i believe an expendable booster is any falcon with the legs stripped off plus no grid fins perhaps other things too eg cold gas thrusters
spacex,not_removed,you have no idea how much i would be happy to even see a few hazy pixels
spacex,not_removed,please post it anyway
spacex,not_removed,cant wait for the pic is really a piece of history in space exploration seeing it again with a rocket vertical on it is amazing
spacex,not_removed,yes i was only could counting the landings ive seen the apollo capsule in the london science museum very eerie thinking that at one point was orbiting the moon with people onboard
spacex,not_removed,also too it is a good point that last time it was a te they are not allowed to fail edit looks like they failed good work uoldsellsword never again they responsible for dispatching hype trains
spacex,not_removed,what do you mean by dont have time theyre the ones setting the schedule they could very well have decided that adding a fit check in prior to the static fire had a reasonable chance of speeding things up or at least decrease the odd of a delay
spacex,not_removed,eh do they really have a set schedule yet though i think its kinda understood that while is still actively being prepared that they are subject to schedule changes on a short notice id rather them take their time for a week or so get it right and not have to revisit gse issues or another style event
spacex,not_removed,seeing it again with a rocket vertical on it is amazing prepare to be disappointed then
spacex,not_removed,what do you mean by dont have time the original plan assumed that would be ready before echostar was even approaching so they had time to slip in some preliminary tanking checks and what not now echostar is here and being delayed due to pad readiness
spacex,not_removed,i can wait one more week ahah
spacex,not_removed,right my point is simply that scheduling a fit check prior to the static fire may indeed still be the fastest path
spacex,not_removed,its up to the mods to decide if this is relevant enough for a whole thread by itself but in case this gets deleted and you wanted an answer id recommend talking to uempower he was a welder that worked on the octaweb production line and your best bet in getting information on the position
spacex,not_removed,i dont see anything i could answer
spacex,not_removed,it was a post asking about welder qualifications and experience to work at spacex but it got deleted
spacex,not_removed,this doesnt look like full size to me why dont they show the grid anymore i feel like there is still a few cm missing which would also explain why it looks so strange and what was the reason why it didnt expand last time did they found the reason
spacex,not_removed,the title is wrong fh core structural testing is complete at the moment there is a fh side core in the structural test stand
spacex,not_removed,a link that includes all of his updates really good stuff thanks utheroadie here are some of the most important bits so whats on site i can discuss is off the stand in a hangar after its full duration burns booster is on the stand getting ready for its test arrived from hawthorne as we knew and is next up on the test stand the fh center core structural test article is in a hangar the structural test stand contains a fh side core for octaweb stress testing not sure what its ultimate use will be dark stains where im guessing some copv testing went on the dragon is a used returned one only one i spotted not certain of serial numbers of either of the test articles what used to be the welding area is now an engine workshop so they can do more procedures there without sending engines back to hawthorne welders have a nice new shed of their own do you happen to know what serial number the core sitting at vafb is
spacex,not_removed,cool photo but maybe im missing something here what indicates that testing on the heavy is complete i see what i think is one core in the middle but those cylinders near it look too short to be a fh setup am i wrong
spacex,not_removed,for the lesswellinformedbutinterested folk like me could someone post an edited version of the picture with arrows and labels

spacex,not_removed,nice do w have confirmation that this is a modified flown core
spacex,not_removed,utheroadie
spacex,not_removed,at the airport to go home the stuctural test stand is not empty had a fh side core in it that nobody i know of spotted leaving hawthorne all i knew about was the obvious engineless fh center core they started painting serial not flight numbers on the base of the booster but in a position it will be obscured by integrated legs will photoshop one up when i get home
spacex,not_removed,good call
spacex,not_removed,reading more facebook comments theres a correction the fh center core is out a side core is in
spacex,not_removed,at least to me the structural stand seems empty again it could still be there and you cant see it in the picture
spacex,not_removed,what i could do of all the stuff on the right half of the picture on the left of the picture
spacex,not_removed,httpiimgurcomdmdsgxupng
spacex,not_removed,that would be great i just see a bunch of white cylinders
spacex,not_removed,the core on the teststand is almost certainly a completely fresh unflown core
spacex,not_removed,they started painting serial not flight numbers on the base of the booster but in a position it will be obscured by integrated legs with so many piling up i can see why they might want an easy way to identify them thanks again for all this information
spacex,not_removed,fh side core new or used
spacex,not_removed,i guess that must have been the reconfigured thaicom stage turned fh side core we saw it enter hawthorne facilities but never leave
spacex,not_removed,can you edit your original title that was labeled misleading people might think i was the misleading one
spacex,not_removed,i have better telephotos to post tomorrow
spacex,not_removed,the aerial view hat helps a lot thanks
spacex,not_removed,it does indeed thanks saved as a reference doc for future
spacex,not_removed,its the best overview map graphic weve ever had keep up the perfectionism
spacex,not_removed,that was actually very good good referencees thank you
spacex,not_removed,it is
spacex,not_removed,new engineless test article if it passes testing and validates their models i expect it could be completed and flown might be missing a lot of guts and plumbing
spacex,not_removed,i guess that must have been the reconfigured thaicom stage turned fh side core except that that it is a new engineless test article so the evidence points the other way actually thaicom is still sitting on a production line in hawthorne and this fh booster sta is a brand new core
spacex,not_removed,its not possible to edit titles however ill ask if its okay to have a comment pinned explaining
spacex,not_removed,ive added a sticky comment and changed the flair
spacex,not_removed,if you want an even more exhaustive map of spacexs operations see
spacex,not_removed,iridium edit nop
spacex,not_removed,there were similar structural articles for the previous versions werent there were those ones converted to flight hardware
spacex,not_removed,youd be correct
spacex,not_removed,yeah definitely intriguing if they have a new side core and center core structurally tested and is indeed being reconfigured into a side core then that would suggest that the falcon heavy test article is actually approaching completion
spacex,not_removed,hasnt the iridium core been at vandy for some time now
spacex,not_removed,the iridium core it shouldve been at vafb for a while now
spacex,not_removed,test article turned into grasshopper and into
spacex,not_removed,is was that was months ago its probably done now being converted to flight hardware for fh as waswill be one other used stage fh demo will use reflown boosters and new core the structural test articles are exclusively for testing for now anyway could be upgraded later and lack engines and avionics and such
spacex,not_removed,it has
spacex,not_removed,both of them are now in mcgregor although is in a decidedly more fragmented state
spacex,not_removed,what about twas built too early to be a test article conversion i assume it was just another
spacex,not_removed,ah gotcha thanks for the clarification
spacex,not_removed,last i saw that it was doing at that time it was still expected to be used for the inflight abort
spacex,not_removed,tanking tests for subcooled lox i was under the impression that booster was incompatible with that stuff maybe thats only as far as actually using it though i could see how they could probably just fill and drain the tanks to check out pad equipment
spacex,not_removed,no just regular tanking checks as far as i know i think the plan was to do the ifa out of vandenberg sometime in midtolate using and then upgrade the pad for the rocket when happened they realised the need to prove reliability in ascloseto flightlike conditions as possible so a shortstack flight wouldnt cut it iirc and from what i could glean this wasnt exactly public info so i may have it confused the decision was made to punt the ifa until after initial spaceflight demos so they could have a flightproven on a flightproven booster i dont know what the plan is for a second stage if any on the ifa that decision was also partially necessitated by the upgrade of all pads to the standard is a variant although now i think about it vandenberg remained compliant up to im not sure if it had been upgraded to prior to the wildfire that threatened the base or if it is that work that is being completed now to make it operational anyway the heel of the reel is that is unfortunately a rocket without a pad or a purpose now location unknown probably in a shed at vandy
spacex,not_removed,good news glad to hear they are making progress on the spacesuits i think the most recent schedule had them certified by sometime this fall im looking forward to seeing more pictures
spacex,not_removed,more news reuter red dragon landing on mars should be able to carry a decent payload no specific numbers though reuter while this effort is of very high interest to spacex its lower priority than comml crew work and other paying customers reuter spacexs contribution to red dragon costs in the ballpark of compared to nasas costs thats million reuter says spacex has an extremely aggressive schedule to make a may launch as currently planned reuter if nasa did mars entry descent and landing tech demo alone likely would not fly until a decade or more after red dragon nasas jim reuter at nac technology meeting says nasa estimates spending over years to support spacex red dragon partnership mcalister were getting more comfortable with spacexs use of densified propellants on but not there yet nasas phil mcalister boeing and spacex commercial crew schedules optimistic but achievable for test flights in and nasas mcalister spacex gaining experience with load and go fueling operations for fullthrust falcon to be used for crew missions nasas phil mcalister second delta critical design review for spacex crew dragon underway turning the corner on locking down design mcalister the crewed test flights boeing and spacex will fly will dock to the iss for an unspecified period likely some number of weeks mcalister expect to formally award postcertification comml crew mission to spacex real soon awarded last nov boeing has phil mcalister space suit design tests coming along for spacex as well want partners to do things safely correctly
spacex,not_removed,is it possible that this is one of those projects that folks assume is unbelievably complicated and costs hundreds of millions of but in reality it just requires a bureaucracyfree group of intelligent people and a decent machine shop
spacex,not_removed,this has everything to do with spacex vertical integration they dont want to be beholden to some other company for a flight critical piece of hardware i would have been more surprised if theyd contracted with davidsonclark
spacex,not_removed,well mars mission kinda requires those suits so it is just normal for spacex to keep them inhouse and thats just the first of the two types they require probably three crew suit protecting from unplanned pressurization loss the one they making now easiest of the bunch as it only has to hold pressure and allow recovery from loss of pressure no need to protect from direct sunlight or mmod eva suit for mars use need this eventually eva suit for inspace use probably need this and while it may share some things with mars surface suit probably not same
spacex,not_removed,i cant wait to see the finished product
spacex,not_removed,if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself
spacex,not_removed,or prototype now this confirms that it probably will look different than httpiimgurcompanqbtmjpg
spacex,not_removed,as long as astronauts looks fashionable im happy xd
spacex,not_removed,ive always wondered why nobody seems to be researching telepresence solutions ie a human remotely controlling a human analogue robot with controls and vr technology obviously i doubt walking would be an option currently but a rover lower body would work fine for most purposes leaving the operator free to sit and control the handsarms with his own we dont do this on earth because hands are a miracle of evolution compared to anything robots can currently do but that changes when you put stiff gloves on and constrain a person in a suit i think it not unreasonable to suggest we could make robots with equivalent dexterity to a suited human and if that were the case there would be considerable advantages to a telepresence solution without a human in the suit the whole thing is just plain inherently safe work times would be increased since the person is not tiring themselves out fighting the resistance of the suit workers can take breaks further reducing the stress of eva activities there is little or no transit time or time spent in compression chamber i dunno just something ive been thinking about
spacex,not_removed,didnt the mcu costume designer design the look of the space suit cant wait to see this
spacex,not_removed,also might we see the design of these in the september reveal of the mct i could see an animation of the architecture including spacesuit clad colonists

spacex,not_removed,something a little less cosplay i imagine
spacex,not_removed,they are making progress on the spacesuits strictly speaking there is nothing surprising a couple of months ago i gave a link to the article the spacesuit can make an one man which is talked about the suit for this application
spacex,not_removed,nasas phil mcalister boeing and spacex commercial crew schedules optimistic but achievable for test flights in and i suppose this is what we suspected spacex seem to like to keep schedules very optimistic in order to push their teams to the limits shoot for the stars and youll reach the sky were also used to regular launch dates slipping so a first crewed test of crew dragon slipping to would perhaps be a fair guess at this point
spacex,not_removed,mcalister were getting more comfortable with spacexs use of densified propellants on but not there yet i assume they mean in terms of such highly densified propellant not having been used before in a humanrated vehicle
spacex,not_removed,awesome stuff i hope we dont see a wall of tweets on rspacex and can keep it as or megathreadsmost of the tweets are in categories red dragon commercial crew spacesuit
spacex,not_removed,thats an interesting question space suits have a long history of development and refinement theyre also the most critical lifesafety equipment in space flight theyre not going to be cheap no matter what you do but perhaps spacex can save money by making them inhouse my guess is that they just dont want to depend on someone else for equipment on their critical path
spacex,not_removed,probably something more than that designin a suit that can survive the rigors of space is far from easy further the testing and review process needs to be extensive to ensure all plausible scenariossituations are covered the cost of failure is a human life and possibly the mission along with it
spacex,not_removed,absolutely space xs r d costs or lack of are perhaps their most incredible and least talked about achievement you may have heard of the gimble actuator rocket component outside contractor quoted space x did it for apx times less
spacex,not_removed,in the end it counts for nothing if the suit doesnt please a bureaucratic group of people who have to sign off on it
spacex,not_removed,pages of experience that aint all going to be paperwork theyre building on a lot of existing expertise and the dragon suit is a fairly easy suit as suits go that plucky startup vs big org trope only flies so far
spacex,not_removed,the space suit mcallister is talking about is for the iva suit milestone under nasas commercial crew contract
spacex,not_removed,well they could theoretically try to combine these suits into one and maybe just add a eva backpack or something while spacesuits are not crazy heavy they do take quite a bit of space which could be a problem on a mars mission atleast if they travel with dragon and not the mcu
spacex,not_removed,multiple prototypes does not necessarily mean the style has changed
spacex,not_removed,oh but its definitely going to have leather on the outside
spacex,not_removed,good points i think the biggest issue is light relay for telepresence unless youre just on the space station but theres also the emotion of actually sending people out into space and well never colonize anywhere if we just control robots so we might as well start learning how to do it with people right away but thats just my view of it all
spacex,not_removed,screw telepresence use vr
spacex,not_removed,i sure hope not all current suits are rooted in design and technology i want a modern badass scifi space suit from spacex
spacex,not_removed,i hope so i want them to look cool but i also want them to look professional and not too hollywood
spacex,not_removed,shoot for the stars and youll reach the sky when launching rockets ending up in the sky is not usually a good thing
spacex,not_removed,spacex seem to like to keep schedules very optimistic in order to push their teams to the limits shoot for the stars and youll reach the sky i think its more about creating schedules optimistically while being flexible about them and not holding engineers accountable or putting them under pressure for slippages due to unforeseen complications ie embrace uncertainty and turn it into a strength as flexible schedules can actually be a lot less stressful to an enthusiastic dedicated team than more rigid schedules
spacex,not_removed,i feel like that should have been worded test flights in and to match the company to the launch date
spacex,not_removed,im guessing its the operational rather than the technical side of things handling and loading and all that which would also mesh with the other tweet about load and go having to scrub and delay a launch multiple times a là flight sucks when youre launching a comsat or even timesensitive iss cargo but it would really suck with people on board since theyve been doing well on the past few launches that could be the increased confidence hes talking about here
spacex,not_removed,maybe theyre concerned that since its thicker it could cause unforseen problems with the engine pumps or that since its got to be colder they might not be able to get fueling done in time and repeated tanking cycles could be a risk to the crew
spacex,not_removed,i thought i read the russians use densified propellant for their manned soyuz launches but i cannot find any mention of this on wikipedia can someone help me out am i right or mistaken
spacex,not_removed,their critical path now that you mention it it makes perfect sense they need the experience sooner or later why pay someone else for the suit if thats just going to be money down the drain actually what would be the alternative source of suits nasa or another company
spacex,not_removed,the nasa book dressing for altitude is eye opening a lot of the initial pressure suit development was actually done sort of ad hoc and without a lot of bureaucracy you can build a prototype pretty cheaply and quickly it can be safe you can make modifications to it pretty quickly and cheaply but the thing about modern full pressure suits from is that they represent years and years of small refinements based on feedback and testing i dont think you can reproduce that cheaply things like improving vision improving neck swivel making better gloves flexibility and touch sensations and adding overall joint flexibility at full pressure took years and tons of money if spacex want to build a safe cheap quick suit that works with regards to keeping the occupant alive im sure they can do it if they want a clean sheet refined suit where the occupant is happy and comfortable and can do all he needs to do at full psi im way less sure
spacex,not_removed,its also worth reiterating how the suit spacex is designing is only really intravehicle not extravehicular although the original commentator may be right that they are doing it better and faster than the alternative everyone also seems to get confused that its nothing like an eva suit or for the surface of a planet
spacex,not_removed,it wont quite need to survive the rigors of space just the rigors of a dragon capsule depressurizing unexpectedly thats still a lot to do but not nearly as complex as an eva suit
spacex,not_removed,amen to that spacesuit design started with an existing pressure suit and took a good decade of intense effort with huge funding and plenty of people looking at the problem to get from there to a viable suit that allowed for an acceptable rang of motion modern suits still have unsolved problems like pulling out fingernails or having hugely uncomfortable chest sections and shoulder linkages and those problems arent unsolved for lack of trying
spacex,not_removed,the same happened with turbo pump for falcon outside contractor said something like at least years of development to working product spacex did it in months
spacex,not_removed,it helps to have the visor maker in californiathe padding made in florida outer cover made in colorado and the intercom made in ohio you can then pay your lobbyist to remind those congressmen part of the suit is made in their state and give them the name of the bureaucrats thats how you really play the game spacex doesnt and just barrels on through with better tech better people and better processes
spacex,not_removed,you have formulated it better than i could thanks
spacex,not_removed,yes but since youll need those plus some advanced models later makes sense to design build inhouse i mean if you want to fly people to mars youll need a spacesuit factory not a very big one but definitely something more than just a handful of handmade suits
spacex,not_removed,are we certain that they arent dual purpose suits it would make sense for spacex to have as much design commonality as possible there and i remember reading a nasa study a while back on inorbit satellite servicing that said dragon would have limited eva capability
spacex,not_removed,i agree the style colours etc wont have changed much but im saying it wont look like the suit in that image it doesnt even look like there is any life support on that suit i know its just a flight suit not for evas but still
spacex,not_removed,i didnt mean to suggest this as an alternative to manned exploration obviously as you point out the speed of light delay makes it unsuitable for anything but maybe low earth orbitbut even that would be logistically challenging due to the orbit im talking about this as an alternative to space suits why go outside when theres already a robot outside and you can just slip on your vr goggles put your arms in the waldos that control the robots arms and pretty much accomplish the exact same tasks
spacex,not_removed,telepresence utilizes vr cameras on the robot in place of the head
spacex,not_removed,if you want a pressuresuit a or semihardsuit or a httpsenwikipediaorgwikispaceactivitysuit aka skinsuit youre going to be using technology rooted in the if you have a spacesuit design that doesnt fall into one of those categories then a lot of people would want to hear about it there are only so many ways to apply suitable pressure to the human body to allow you to survive in a vacuum
spacex,not_removed,you understand agile
spacex,not_removed,its also just new when you do something new sometimes there are unforseen issues that are not immediately obvious edit called it
spacex,not_removed,i dont think so only think theyve talked about developing and testing it
spacex,not_removed,nasas suits have all come from httpsenwikipediaorgwikiilcdover since apollo i expect that spacex could contract them to make suits
spacex,not_removed,they need the experience sooner or later why pay someone else for the suit if thats just going to be money down the drain time same reason they outsourced their early turbopumps
spacex,not_removed,dont forget that spacex probably has access to the body of knowledge which created those advanced suits they are not going to be starting from scratch but rather from a clean slate they will be able to build a better prototype because of all of the research that went into the other pressure suits once a design is no longer a prototype there is more bureaucracy added to make sure no changes cause safety issues
spacex,not_removed,indeed anyone who wants to know what goes into developing the previous state of the art pages of serious stuff makes one appreciate the hard problems suit designers face it is not very hard to do a suit that keeps you alive in a vacuum but it is very hard to do something even remotely comfortable while retaining the ability to actually do anything else other than just sit in your seat with the suit pressurized fancy looks is fairly far down the list but definitely something which should be on the list once you sort out all the bits that keep you alive and comfortable
spacex,not_removed,that holds true assuming they use the same basic design however if their rockets are any indication the basic concept may be quite different to reduce complexity and cost without needing the refinements
spacex,not_removed,thats a very good point thanks for the reminder
spacex,not_removed,even so that is still a lot of complexity with a high cost of failure
spacex,not_removed,the spacesuit that mcallister is talking about is not that complex its an iva suit that will function comparable to the aces suits used on the space shuttles or the soyuz sokol suits which dont even have a helmet
spacex,not_removed,this documentary on the apollo program covers the development of the spacesuit really really interesting while im sure plenty was glosses particularly the bureaucratic parts it was definitely a pragmatically driven process
spacex,not_removed,a description of what its like to wear a suit and train in it including the bad things that can happen if the suit isnt spot on
spacex,not_removed,a friend saw chris hadfield speak last year and he talked about how many astronauts whod done evas would suffer nerve damage in their hands due to the difficulty of gripping against the pressurised gloves
spacex,not_removed,were sure that nasa is paying them for an iva suit
spacex,not_removed,think of an iva suit as being like a falcon in that it is close to the minimum you need for the least demanding situation surviving cabin depressurization is much less demanding that exiting the vehicle no micrometeoroid protection minimal radiation protection most life support is handled by the umbilical a small emergency oxygen bottle is on the helmet to last until the suit gets hooked up mobility does not have to be as great as an eva suit provides an iva suit is needed and it is also a good learning experience leading toward eva and mars suits
spacex,not_removed,it actually seems to me that color is one of the things most likely to change like this is a photo by annie liebowitz for a vanity fair article it wouldnt surprise me if the final suit is httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternationalorange or a similar color for safety purposes like the shuttleera launch and landing suits this was discussed a few days ago here and people were speculating that automatic strobe lights like on an airline lifejacket might be sufficient instead of a color change but it still seems to me that a bright color is the easiest way to distinguish a human body in a blue or grey ocean
spacex,not_removed,well yeah there are only so many options for the core suit technology but like so much of the industry the thought around suits has been if its not broken dont fix it nasas current suit has been in use since the early and russias since the early and those suits arent dramatically different from the apolloera suits im not suggesting that spacex is going to come up with a whole new core technology but we have decades more materials and design experience since the last revision of suits hopefully spacex can bring some of the same energy and willingness to innovate to the suit as well as the vehicles
spacex,not_removed,well its true that all the joints that actually need to articulate need constant volume joints for the rest you have more options though whats the practical difference between a hardsuit and a soft suit that inflates until it becomes rigid
spacex,not_removed,he must not be a project manager p
spacex,not_removed,shame most project managers dont hey were gonna do agile now because it is all the rage so make sure all your work is done in the next week sprint what no we get to decide what youre gonna work on what do we pay you for do as youre told
spacex,not_removed,it is ok to be cautious but then again spacex will launch a lot of before they put a crew on top of it or more so that should return the risk
spacex,not_removed,ilc dover doesnt make all suits httpsenwikipediaorgwikidavidclarkcompany also makes suits such as aces and shuttle launch and entry suits arguably dcc is more relevant for current crew suits vs eva suits
spacex,not_removed,they have been working with orbital outfitters on suits for a while now
spacex,not_removed,also dont forget that molly mccormick one of the early faces of spacex on launch webcasts is a and im sure shes not the only one on staff working in this area
spacex,not_removed,while they do not require a plss and can accept more limited mobility and micrometeoroid protection the suits still need to deal with supplying oxygen removing ventilation in microgravity is trickier than expected heating and cooling comfort under high acceleration maintaining sufficient flexibility to operate controls a reduced issue for the dragon which follows the russian philosophy of having the crew be as handsoff as possible evacuating or handling waste allowing for drinking and potentially eating depending on mission duration etc the shoulder ergonomics alone are a nontrivial problem
spacex,not_removed,well it seems that nasa is working on redesigning spacesuits themselves the z series spacesuits look very promising if they can manage to complete them of course
spacex,not_removed,one thing that would simplify wearing a suit would be to incorporate the water cooled undergarment into the suit itself so that getting into and out of the suit is a faster simpler process
spacex,not_removed,a hardsuit is an absolute constantvolume suit so even if you pressurise it to then movement in any pose is not affected by pose with the exception of gloves a flexible suit even with constantvolume joints is not perfectly constantvolume even with the lower pressure of the eemu it still requires effort to keep the limbs bent away from the static pose
spacex,not_removed,thats why scrum does not have any project managers
spacex,not_removed,thanks i didnt know about dcc so ilc makes the eva suits and dcc makes the others
spacex,not_removed,arent the z series suits eva suits though not really suited pun intended to invehicle activities
spacex,not_removed,that seems to be the current case though both are probably capable of doing both things iirc i think dcc made felix baumgartners high altitude jump suit for the red bull jump from the edge of space thing
spacex,not_removed,yup they are designed to be used on the surface they do have some pretty sick features tough primarily the httpsenwikipediaorgwikisuitport not only because they save a lot of space in a vehicle they also can enter and exit the suit much quicker right now you spend at least hours just to put on the spacesuit
spacex,not_removed,a lot of that time is needed to prevent the bends when switching to a lower pressure pure oxygen environment
spacex,not_removed,yet to be determined who captures the flag though
spacex,not_removed,thats a great picture of crew and cargo dragon together in there
spacex,not_removed,will serve as a lifeboat for the space station for up to seven months that answers my question from yesterday will be great to see crew dragons as a semipermanent fixture on the iss
spacex,not_removed,given regular supply missions what is the practical limit for the number of full time iss personnel
spacex,not_removed,is there any info how much are these contracts worth

spacex,not_removed,is this a separate appropriations bill that just got approval or simply a part of the existing budget for the commercial crew program that had charles bolden officially release the funds i would assume that future contracts would be pending congressional funding that would extend the program
spacex,not_removed,isnt spacex at least half a year ahead of boeing isnt it pretty certain theyll be first barring any large unforeseen setbacks
spacex,not_removed,probably whomever gets there first but is getting there with first demo flight no crew sufficient or do they need to get there with first crewed flight seems more in line with tradition it seems unlikely that if one of them flies crew there the would be refused to take the flag back on the other hand even the first crewed flight will still be a test flight and not a real crewed flight so maybe its the first real crewed flight that counts which means that depending on politics that even if company a is first two both uncrewed and crewed demo flights and company b is hot on their heals that company b might get first real crewed flight and take home the flag
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomflatodayjdean nasa has awarded spacex second of two guaranteed commercial crew missions to iss boeing already has two orders tbd who flies first when this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,the picture is from
spacex,not_removed,from the schedule that would be demo leaving with in the foreground
spacex,not_removed,dont they use them as a way to get back like with the capsule they get to the iss they get back down
spacex,not_removed,the iss can host seven astronauts but they are limited to six in the moment because soyuz capsules can only transport three astronauts when the space shuttle was in service they had up to thirteen astronauts at the same time
spacex,not_removed,commercial crew will allow the iss to reach a maximum aroundtheclock occupation of
spacex,not_removed,and when does nasa pay
spacex,not_removed,when they are not upfront about it its always a lot more than expected
spacex,not_removed,if you mean the value of individual postcertification missions pcms specifically then no thats proprietary and not released but they are part of the overall cctcap contracts which have public values spacexs was for up to though that would be including the full pcms
spacex,not_removed,it should be part of the cctcap contract
spacex,not_removed,yes but unforeseen setbacks are a somewhat consistent part of the space industry to date hopefully spacex keeps its goal and we see a manned flight by the end of but im not sure id be too confident in that date
spacex,not_removed,only in terms of currently planned dates for hitting milestones boeing have moved their planned dates back quite a bit while spacex havent changed theirs for a while that doesnt necessarily mean theyre completely on track though they may well be but they could also announce delays at any point and boeing could always announce further delays
spacex,not_removed,spacex has a fairly established history of missing their dates they are great at doing what they commit to but usually later than expected
spacex,not_removed,must be a crewed mission to bring the flag back home
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomspcplcyonline hale says he loves these kinds of charts this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,the soyuz also stays with the crew you arrive in a capsule its your lifeboat for as long as youre there and after half a year or more you fly back using that same pod its a good way to ensure all the humans can leave the station when something goes wrong
spacex,not_removed,they do but until that time comes its a lifeboat
spacex,not_removed,with the shuttle assisting with life support iirc
spacex,not_removed,the increase from to is expected to double the amount of science that gets done on the station according to nasa i know youve read this just adding more context to your post for others
spacex,not_removed,i wonder where the crew member will sleep its a shame there are only crew quarters maybe theyll do some rotations or something i wish the httpsenwikipediaorgwikihabitationmodule hadnt been cancelled
spacex,not_removed,in small bits at each contractspecified milestone most of it prior to launch rest on mission success
spacex,not_removed,like the crs contracts commercial crew is payasyougo so this will come out of the operating budget for whatever year it happens
spacex,not_removed,we can assume the same for boeing
spacex,not_removed,when you remove things that dont have a customer waiting on them its a better track record what i mean is that the falcon heavy is pushed back a lot but they also dont have a customer for that launch so it always gets under prioritized when there is a bottleneck of time money or personnel same could also be said for the relaunch but that flight reportably has a customer now so expect its timeline to start to become more firm as far as dragon goes spacex has been pretty good with time management except for the time lost due to the rud last year you might say the dragon is a bit behind their original ambitions schedule but seeing how ita almost a year ahead of boeing with the pad abort test already done they are doing pretty well another example is inflight abort this test is not required by nasa but spacex wants to do it anyway iirc and thus it keeps geting get pushed back to now a month before the first flight
spacex,not_removed,i have heard that part of the delay is that if spacex doesnt launch with in somthing like two seconds of its launch time its scrubbed period is this true why do other launches face these kinds of rigorous requirements is a very very small window did space shuttle have these sort of tight windows
spacex,not_removed,yeah i suppose this is what happens when you incorporate capture the flag with a space race
spacex,not_removed,the real world just doesnt want to consider the feelings of hollywood
spacex,not_removed,i take it that means the current six are tied up in maintenance tasks a lot
spacex,not_removed,i think that statement is true for the present crew from nasa esa and jaxa not the russian part of the station out of are involved in maintenance is for science on average out of still do maintenance but can do science
spacex,not_removed,the new guy will be forced to sleep in the beam
spacex,not_removed,i thought there were in the us segment and three in the russian sm
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if the crew dragon could be used
spacex,not_removed,id say more likely for them spacex obviously has a bad wrap for delays but in this case theyve been working with their own hardware and processes for over a decade and dragon certainly has some strong carryover to plus its mostly inhouse boeing is using a lot of contractors
spacex,not_removed,they do have customers waiting on falcon heavy one even publicly switched launchers because of the delays they just dont have very many
spacex,not_removed,i wouldnt necessarily expect the first reused booster they sell to be the first one that flies thatigut be a new deal for a satellite not ready for a year if someone else wants one before then and they have a payload ready they will go first
spacex,not_removed,thats true now because they load subcooled propellants if they dont launch in time they have to detank and start over because it is getting warmer in the tanks before they can do that a launch window is usually over they can delay starting to fuel up the rocket but once they have started fuelling they cannot have delays
spacex,not_removed,check out the answer about
spacex,not_removed,for launches to the iss yes if they miss the launch time the iss wont be in a matching orbit every second of delay puts the iss further down range when youre launching satellites and not aiming for a rendezvous with something already in orbit delays are generally not a problem
spacex,not_removed,realistically whoever gets the first crewed demo up there is really likely to be the one flying the next american expedition crew anyway
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,yes station maintenance takes way more time than expected
spacex,not_removed,nah one gogetter and six slackers
spacex,not_removed,and they will jettison it if he screams to loud
spacex,not_removed,only in the russian segment
spacex,not_removed,bad wrap in this case it would be rap without the w
spacex,not_removed,agreed spacex clearly sets their timelines as soonest possible and boeing is most likely
spacex,not_removed,falcon heavy is in the same situations you know
spacex,not_removed,what carryover is there dragon and seem nothing alike
spacex,not_removed,there is no problem with fh there is problems with landing pads launching pad usaf radars autodestrucion system they want to to use gps
spacex,not_removed,not for the first launch of the fh and the others may be more futher out when the payload is available
spacex,not_removed,i dont think that is exactly correct although youre close they can have short delays less than say minutes but certainly more than seconds with the rocket fueled on the pad the cryogenic fuel warming slightly only becomes a problem if it impacts the performance of the rocket beyond the margin necessary for that particular payload this means that for a light geo launch they could probably technically launch without any subcooling at all while on a launch like they may very well have only a handful of seconds that the fuel temperature remains within acceptable margins i dont profess to know their tolerance for such things though but i do know theyve had a minute hold on a ft launch before boat in the exclusion zone if memory serves to be fair that didnt end up going after the minutes but it is notable that they didnt scrub the launch immediately when the short delay became necessary
spacex,not_removed,well the iss is a very high mileage vehicle and they have to import all their spare parts from earth at least spacex has been working on lowering the delivery fees
spacex,not_removed,i like this theory id sure as hell be camped out in the cupola just watching earth go by
spacex,not_removed,til thanks
spacex,not_removed,bah i hesitated as i wrote it neither made a lot of sense to me rap it is
spacex,not_removed,or rep from reputation which makes a whole lot more sense
spacex,not_removed,it would actually be rep meaning reputation
spacex,not_removed,i suppose i cant say not an expert but it would seem intuitive that building a capsule builds a certain institutional experience that benefits you when designing a new capsule falcon is completely different from bfr but id bet that building has helped them better design the bfr no
spacex,not_removed,much of the software can be carried over draco thrusters are the same some components of the eclss could be the same most importantly worker experience with the tooling and procedures to make the pressure vessels and integrate components to themthe entire dragon to the launch vehicle
spacex,not_removed,but you cant have subsequent launches until you have a first
spacex,not_removed,anything that vehicle thats in orbit for longer than a few hours is by necessity a highmileage vehicle
spacex,not_removed,turkey on rye with no mayo so its dry as fuck a fate worse than death
spacex,not_removed,maybe they were having problems wrapping their stages for transport
spacex,not_removed,bfr broccolifishromaine lettuce
spacex,not_removed,its shortened from rap sheet a history of your crimes
spacex,not_removed,should have went with bad rep then
spacex,not_removed,nope its rap httpwwwpatrickkphillipscomgrammarisitabadraporbadrep
spacex,not_removed,i would certainly feel great shame from being served that
spacex,not_removed,bacon fries rootbeer
spacex,not_removed,and i always thought the proper term was bad rep short for reputation
spacex,not_removed,eh it seems like poor english taking hold
spacex,not_removed,so in this case it would be rep as spacex has a well earned reputation for being excessively optimistic in delivery time frames
spacex,not_removed,if youre good at something never do it for free
spacex,not_removed,spacex would have to pay for the rocket also ses made a lower cost deal anyway so less money is at stake with also grasshopper could fly around mcgregor but a full duration first stage launch would need to be at ksc or vandy which at this point pad time is the limiting factor in launch turnarounds
spacex,not_removed,if it failed i assure you neither the customers the faa or the public would think it didnt count they have a lot of experience with this vehicle they can inspect it to within an inch of its life and be highly confident in its performance its really no different than any other launch we just ascribe more meaning to it
spacex,not_removed,pros if it fails its only a test failure and doesnt count towards rocket safety in public perception public perception doesnt matter too much for spacex its nice to have good pr and spacex works at it sure but it is not a publicly traded company and its funds come from other private companies and governments this is different to nasa who has to get its funds from the government and thus has to have a solid image to those americans who actually bother to vote so the bad pr from a test failure or actual failure isnt great buts it actually not a big deal far bigger is the opinions of the insurers the faa and customers any failure whether a dummy load or a satellite would mean a stand down of the entire falcon fleet until spacex does the full faulttree analysis and comes up with a report that the faa is happy with that takes months the faa doesnt care if it is a dummy load or a bazillion dollar satellite they are tasked with making sure rockets dont kill people mostly innocents on the ground so theres very little down side for spacex in using an actual payload the upsides are real tens of millions of dollars and the opportunity to really disrupt the industry by not cutting any corners and actually reuse
spacex,not_removed,likean actual launch
spacex,not_removed,essentially theyve done this at least eight times with the booster at mcgregor albeit held down on the ground with a simulated load rather than actual dummy payload video of one such test can be seen here
spacex,not_removed,i think you answered your own question can anyone speculate on them your cons are the good reasons spacex isnt doing a dummy launch your list of pros and cons seem well thoughtout im sure we can tweak them ad finitum we are a clever knowledgeable and thoughtful bunch after all but i think you captured the heart of the matter in particular consider your third con the full launch manifest a launch with a dummy second stage means that a customer is bumped from this year to next spacex clearly has high confidence in the relaunch thus the costbenefit analysis steers towards no flight test of stage
spacex,not_removed,the satellite providers talked to spacex and they concluded it was a winwin to launch a payload there is a high demand even for an unproven technology i suppose if there had not been such a high demand for reused boosters spacex would have had to test a few by itself
spacex,not_removed,this line of thinking verges on not believing in the technology and that just aint the spacex way options are launch a dummy it fails points money wasted on the test bad pr and competitors take note launch a dummy it succeeds points good pr not all that inspiring or significant money still wasted launch a real rocket it fails points sadness and frustration but about as much bad pr as a failed test launch a real rocket it succeeds points huge milestone in rocket technology no money wasted
spacex,not_removed,if it fails its only a test failure and doesnt count towards rocket safety in public perception from public perception seeing all the failed experimental landing attempts is perceived as spacex being a massive faliure
spacex,not_removed,youre essentially saying an already flown booster is the most reliable thats what spacex is working to achieve and everyone is so eager to see the first real test of that is this next flight the industry right now assumes the opposite that a flown booster is more likely to fail so spacex has to offer them at a discount

spacex,not_removed,besides the other points brought up by other people spacex currently has a shortage of available launch pads it has only one on the west coast and a huge launch manifest to get through they need that pad to make money its as simple as that if they take an extra weeks to prep and launch a dummy payload on a flightproven booster thats weeks the pad is unavailable for making money and besides if you find a customer who is willing to take the risk you can be making money while learning to refly boosters whats not to like
spacex,not_removed,do you mean testing a new booster by launching before its first flight if so this would be a good idea much farther down the road if they achieve the rocketsarelikeairplanes point but its far too early to know that flight proven is actually safer than brand new were all hoping for a bathtub curve but theyve got to prove it works that way first if you mean testing alreadyflown boosters basically in order to establish that flightproven is indeed safe and to give them data about how to refurbish yes this would be nice but heres the biggest reason why they wont their biggest bottleneck right now seems to be the pad turnaround time basically the infrastructure and operations everything relating to the launch process even when they have more pads up and running they only have one droneship per ocean which takes several days to go out and come back in they only have two launch crews and their refurbishment team is likely only as large as it needs to be right now to refurbish a rocket in a few months in an exploratory how should we do this manner at this stage adding more cores wouldnt improve their learning or throughput or anything
spacex,not_removed,would it be beneficial to test these boosters with a dummy second stagepayload thats exactly what they are going to do with fh the primary reason cited was that it removes timing constraints for the launch i believe and there were apparently people willing to pay for a live payload on the first launch of a new vehicle so risk is not really a problem whats the point of actually launching a booster aerodynamics controls thats not the parts that wear out if it worked on the launch it will work on the just as well engines are so much easier to test statically in mcgregor many times over if necessary structural failures is not something to be expected on the second flight specifically especially after successful static burns
spacex,not_removed,i think one of the reasons that spacex is successful is that they never do things that have a single goal they launched a satellite and then tested soft landing the spent first stage in the ocean they launched a cargo mission to the iss and tested the technology they plan to use in the crewed dragon capsule they launched more satellites and used the spent first stages to learn how not to land on a sea platform they launched a satellite successfully recovered the first stage then used it as their test platform for reflying a first stage they always stack as much as they can in the benefit column so that they can lower costs and innovateiterate as quickly as possible from my point of view the depth of their strategic goals is what sets them apart
spacex,not_removed,hi ujonsaxon great analysis btw spacex sometimes do things which seem completely illogical until you take a couple of steps back to view them in a larger perspective when they started in elon musk was happy to finance development until the company became commercially viable after which they were able to self fund such work note much of this development either directly or indirectly assists them to fulfill their goal of making humanity multiplanetary spacexs corporate mission for instance technologies like supersonic retropropulsion and propulsive landing will be essential for landing large payloads on mars however they have to fund these new technologies from corporate profits hence normal commercial launches are used because the launch generates sufficient profit to pay for the actual test elon musk could sell all his shares to attempt to pay for this development but would probably lose control of spacex unfortunately this might reduce the chance of achieving this multiplanetary goal because the new owners might have their own ideas about possible corporate goals so far spacex have been quite successful at funding development from commercial profits which probably means commercial launches will be inextricably linked with development work for some time certainly reducing launch costs should generate more profit allowing them to attempt their most ambitious corporate goal
spacex,not_removed,a full launch costs a customer around so it costs spacex somewhat less is there anyone here who could estimate what a launch with a flight proven booster and no second stage or the cheapest chuck of metal they would need to make it realistic might cost
spacex,not_removed,they have done a lot of static firing of landed boosters the famous max damage core from last year has gone through full test firings after it landed to make sure that preflown doesnt mean worn out the engines are designed for reuse and preflown engines have been lifetime tested after flight the rest of the rocket is designed for reuse and has been inspected to the nth degree this is not a cheap launch this first reuse will have cost spacex more than a normal launch its going to work just as reliably as any other launch
spacex,not_removed,the reason that you test things is to mitigate risk so the question is whether doing this would mitigate sufficient risk to be worth the price if risk were mitigated that would mean that by definition the third flight of a booster would be less risky than the second flight i am not a rocket designer but it seems unlikely to me that that would be true i would expect that like most things mechanical that once we are past the initial defects stage more usage means more accumulated stress and more likelihood of a problem or to put this another way it is likely that the risk of an issue goes up as flight time accumulates if you do a full flight as the second flight your relaunch the third flight will have a higher risk than the second flight
spacex,not_removed,its only a test failure and doesnt count towards rocket safety there is no such thing and we should call it rocket failure after refurbishing such a failure will only delay core reuse and not commercial operations of falcon the only benefit of launching dummy second stage is insurance premium paid for the payload the only risk that spacex is taking in case flight proven core fails is loss of consumer confidence in refurbishing procedure and core reuse only after failure it will make sense to launch flight proven cores with dummy loads to gain confidence of their consumers currently spacex does not have that problem and they would address it when they get there hopefully not lets hope that flight proven core reuse becomes common in the future and spacex becomes first company to achieve that
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,these things arnet as risky as they sound or they wouldnt do it at all all enegines have demonstrated reusability landing is proven the risk may actually be less for a proven booster than one just off the assembly line that could have an undetected catastrophic manufacturing faikure
spacex,not_removed,a suppose that a good reason could be that an entire flight is putting a lot of stress on the single rocket components and multiple refurbishments could get complicated i suppose that before flying it again they will change some component i just think about the recent problem they had with turbine propeller blades being partially broken even if spacex is claiming that this is not compromising the safety of the launch​ i doubt they mean on multiple launches my good guess is that they are going to change them and other components for every flight until they come up with a better technology that is resilient to multiple flights immediate reuse is going to happen but it may take a bit of time before we get there am i completely wrong
spacex,not_removed,range cost and schedule the landing legs are not shown to be reusable yet
spacex,not_removed,ever since amos incident i always thought instead of putting the satellite on top during sf why didnt spacex just put a dummy load of the same mass that way if the rocket ever had an rud during sf the real satellite wouldnt have been damaged the weight of the dummy load wouldve helped the sf seem as similar to a real launch as possible without putting the real payload at risk its better than the sf they do now without any payload
spacex,not_removed,would u do something for free if a customer was offering to pay for it
spacex,not_removed,i think you are wrong on every count of course i could be the one who is wrong you are worried about failures elon is not he believed since he founded spacex that once he landed a rocket it was good to refly because all the systems were working when it touched down you claim the cost is lower with a dummy load why i think your argument is that if you had lead weights instead of furniture in the back of an wheeler you could drive across the country without paying as much for the trip i think the costs are still there what cost goes away spacex gets paid for this relaunch you say spacex can raise their launch frequency with dummy payloads but if they could launch more often they would be doing so with commercial payloads your argument is like saying that if you loaded lead weights instead of furniture in the back of an wheeler you could make many more trips across the country you say spacex could use a different pad preparing a new pad and training a crew is nontrivial as texas and have shown us
spacex,not_removed,computer modeling would be extremely accurate for these things id say so no need for a full launch just to test payload limits when this can be done mathematically
spacex,not_removed,plus if all youre risking is the fallout from it occurring in the public eye do you really think the media will be any kinder if it is a test flight or a commercial flight those rockets arent going anywhere and are all presumably fit for reuse theyre the equivalent of a rocketsavings account
spacex,not_removed,yep typical thursday —my buddy a spacex employee at the afterparty in el segundo today
spacex,not_removed,yes an actual launch with countdown and everything just without the second stage without a payload and mainly without the huge cost of failing both money and public perception public perception is important for client confidence and nasa contracts
spacex,not_removed,yes and through such testing spacex have a far better understanding of the risks and failure modes than we do we can assume theyve done everything reasonable to mitigate those risks so the upcoming flight is probably much less of a test than people might assume and more just business as usual its still significant but not because its high risk one of the reasons we fans get nervous is because we dont understand the risks in detail id expect that if spacex thought there was a significant risk that required a test flight to be understood they would do that
spacex,not_removed,this tests reigniting an engine and some engine loads but leaves out significant stresses of real flight mainly but not only the harsh landing stress it wouldnt be instead of these tests they are much cheaper and give significant benefit but there is still quite a gap between them and real launches im asking about an intermediate step between that and commercial launches compare the confidence of these test with a booster that launched and landed times at full orbital performance the booster essentially performing a complete flight profile the cost is far greater than ground testing but so is the benefit
spacex,not_removed,with a simulated load rather than actual dummy payload no the orange cap was purely supplementing the holddowns not simulating flight loading conditions
spacex,not_removed,launching a real rocket is not just a failure here means everything else gets grounded and it will count as another mission failure
spacex,not_removed,and were far worse pr than explosion production rocket failures are fairly rare and a failure would immediately ground the fleet and require extensive fault analysis versus say the explosion which suspended launch operations for about two weeks
spacex,not_removed,nah most of the public dont know that spacex even exist some small subset of tragics know they exist and think the failures are bad some smaller subset of tragic fanatics are on this subreddit and know its really good and the people who actually pay them money the customers get actual data from spacex and know more than all of us
spacex,not_removed,it does require spacex to have full confidence in their pre flown stage they obviously have that confidence it also needs a customer who sees that confidence by spacex as sufficient proof to take the risk it is very fortunate that spacex has such a customer
spacex,not_removed,thanks for the respectful reply quite refreshing i was hoping to get more specific estimates in replies information like would range constraints for a test flight be the same as for a real flight or does the fact that any pad will do and there is no second stage and payload to track make it less of an issue could these test launches happen without delaying commercial launches too much if test launches replace commercial then obviously its not viable but if tests replace commercial then it might be what would the expected cost of such a launch be its for fuel but would the launch be it makes a big difference to feasibility if its under then i think it could be feasible if then probably not how simple a dummy payload would be needed to achieve a useful test would a cap on the booster be usefulrealistic or would it require real weight and length to simulate a second stage structure are there any useful tests like testing heat shields on the landing dummy second stage that could be achieved with this that need the full speed but cant really hitch a ride on a commercial launch im imagining launching and landing the same booster say time in a few months with far less refurbishment than you could get away with for a commercial launch at this stage that could potentially significantly shorten the time till commercial rapid reuse which is the final goal because its so economically beneficial and could outweigh the cost of the tests im just guessing i dont know nearly enough of the technicalities i wanted to know more of the specifics most of the general proscons i could and did list myself the most common response here aside from the obvious cost although i saw no estimate was that public perception will not distinguish between test and real failure of course that is a concern but far from an insurmountable problem write a big test on the cap and say in advance that its expected to break after launches because its purposefully not being fully refurbished or some such thing that marketing is not rocket science take an example from blue origins capsule escape test not many would have considered it a failure even if the booster had disintegrated because it was advertised as the expected outcome
spacex,not_removed,in theory is the cost of fueling the first stage for a full duration flight so it would cost that plus whatever it costs to man the range and all that jazz
spacex,not_removed,at the moment any test launch cost them the time slot they could use to fly a customers payload time slots are at a premium because of the launch backlog and because is out of service for some reason they can not fly from vandenberg at the moment i would like to know why
spacex,not_removed,i just think about the recent problem they had with turbine propeller blades being partially broken there were no blades partially broken there were microfractures well known and understood from engine tests in mcgregor and regarded inconsequential for even repeated flights by spacex they do fly these blades for this flight and have tested engines with this characteristic times in quick succession without problems which would qualify them for at least more flights even under the most stringent requirements
spacex,not_removed,i believe they have static fired these engines multiple times without problem they acknowledge the cracks they believe they wont lead to near term failure and they have a fix in block i dont believe theyre changing them but i also dont believe theyre expecting more than a couple flights each for boosters earlier than block
spacex,not_removed,this is down to bad luck they didnt integrate the real payload before the sf until a couple of months before the amos incident i think it may have only been the second time they did that iirc they were trying to streamline the launch procedure and speed up the process
spacex,not_removed,honestly i feel like ive entered a different dimension with some of the replies here
spacex,not_removed,rockets in the rocket account or how many is it already actually i lost count
spacex,not_removed,over time new risks and faults might be identified with the old rockets turning their value to zero
spacex,not_removed,pretty sure elon said that none of the current salvaged rockets are going to fly again except the one lifting edit appears i was mistaken
spacex,not_removed,yup money
spacex,not_removed,public perception pff thats been skewed far enough already you really think the majority of the public is gonna do enough research to differentiate between a testlaunch failure and an actual launch failure i know more than a few people that were screaming that nasa should pull their funding from spacex because their rockets kept blowing upon the droneships
spacex,not_removed,so theres less payload value at stake in your case which is generally covered by insurance but that means spacex has to eat the cost of refurbishing flying and recovering the rocket instead of having a paying customer cover that expense also while public perception might be helped a bit by it being only a test flight im not sure how much that would help in the case of a televised live streamed launch failure ive seen plenty of people on reddit who thought that spacexs landing tests were already just test flights and not additional tests done on real payload flights so i dont think the technicalities of the launch would make a huge pr difference also if spacex launched a falcon even a reused booster on a test flight and had a significant failure it could possibly still trigger an investigation into what failed and whether it was an issue that could impact new boosters as well
spacex,not_removed,the people who calculate risk are the ones who decide on contracts and those people would rate a test failure and a live failure the same the rest of the public dont count were all very nice but were incidental to the fullyfunctioning mars cult theres no public stock trading to lose value because wall street got skittish this is exactly why theres no public stock
spacex,not_removed,im hoping thas the answer i too am assuming this flight is not as risky as many perceive because it had a long time to refurbish and test the booster its more for the rapid reuse that the testing would be needed launching and landing until you see what gives and correct it that type of testing would inevitably lead to failures
spacex,not_removed,but is the benefit greater assume that mission success launch is the only essential criteria and assume that launch stresses are well modelled by the static fires in this situation then we do static fires as they have done to confirm the rocket will launch testing that it will land multiple times can be done with a dummy payload or a real payload if were confident it will launch ok then the dummy payload has no benefit over the real payload the real payload actually gets launched no downside there and if the rocket fails to land you lose it again same either way the big difference is that you generate revenue whilst you do it so unless there are much more major differences than im suggesting then why not get your testing paid for
spacex,not_removed,tldr if they were only trying to create a reusable rocket it might make sense to invest in these tests however getting people to mars is expensive and they have already gone a long path to creating a rocket to handle the stresses involved in addition to other comments i would like to also suggest that it comes down to goals as well these boosters have been designed over the course of the last few years for this exact purpose if spacex is confident enough that the rockets will be good enough to successfully relaunch another craft to orbit using every opportunity to help back and fund their primary goal of getting people to mars is a better use of resources than wasting dummy loads to a booster that was designed for more if they are not confident at this point that they are making significant progress towards a reusable rocket that is at least as reliable as one that is disposable what hope do they have of using the technology they have outlined to get to mars
spacex,not_removed,without a second stage and payload it isnt a true test of the vehicle of the spacex failures was the result of a second stage issue with only mass on the top of the first stage the rocket would experience different aerodynamics and the center of gravity would most likely be further back compared to a long a real launch it would be like only testing a car on a nascar track you may catch some issues but others like the brakes dont work on a hill or cant make a sharp right turn youd never catch spacex feels that the vehicle is safe enough static fires at their facility in texas are to hardup test the vehicle static fires on the launch pad are to validate the rocket pad and all support systems are good to go
spacex,not_removed,again we definitely dont know that as a fact shotwell calling it a variable load head and the large size of the cables seems to indicate it serves some other purpose than merely a mass simulator which could be achieved much more simply
spacex,not_removed,but it presses down and to some extent produces similar loads on the rocket body though not all not variable bending loads
spacex,not_removed,launching a real rocket is not just a failure here means everything else gets grounded and it will count as another mission failure not much different then launching a dummy everything would still be grounded if it failed
spacex,not_removed,sorry i was accounting for likeliness of of each event without realizing it launch a dummy it fails chance of failure that would result in points points launch a dummy it succeeds chance of success that would result in points points launch a real rocket it fails chance of failure that would result in points points launch a real rocket it succeeds chance of success that would result in points points maybe the points need adjusted but since spacex is in fact launching a rocket with a real payload they logically must value the chance of success with a real rocket more than they fear a failure in my example above you can see they only stand to gain as much as they loose with a dummy but with a real rocket all things considered they stand to gain considerably more than they might lose
spacex,not_removed,what would the expected cost of such a launch be its for fuel but would the launch be it makes a big difference to feasibility if its under then i think it could be feasible if then probably not it would be over million guaranteed the air force alone requires over people to deal with the range thats after decreasing staffing by due to spacex using an autodestruct the cost to have the cost guard on hand to remove boats that violate the launch perimeter is i think about but they dont have to purchase this i am just including it as an example of how ridiculously expensive launches are
spacex,not_removed,in a nutshell you are of course correct testing would be much more efficient if performed in isolation from normal commercial activities this is the normal model for such development however this kind of work is normally paid for by the government range constraints would be a problem unless they set up an independent test site somewhere at much greater cost unfortunately the problem with performing major development on a shoestring is that you need to use whatever facilities and opportunities are available btw gwynne shotwell mentioned it costs to refurbish the booster stage after each launch plus for fuel plus range fees and salaries so overall youre probably talking cost per repeat flight if thats any help but thats they dont have to spend out of their own pocket if they can convince a customer to use a flight proven booster
spacex,not_removed,it would also cost them a slot which they would otherwise have used for a paid launch so youd have price of a full reusable launch cost of second stage
spacex,not_removed,only polar and retrograde launches are possible from vandenburg theres not much demand for those
spacex,not_removed,if you dont count the one on permanent display
spacex,not_removed,or you can make modifications to those for hundreds of thousands of dollars rather than millions to make a new one
spacex,not_removed,source please
spacex,not_removed,except they might pay in the long run if their insurance goes up because of a failure
spacex,not_removed,yeah i agree they dont seem to be in a rush to do the rapid reuse thing though which is good one of the great successes of spacex was how they used early commercial launches to support the initial booster recovery tests i see them doing similar things using the continuing paid launches to support reuse process improvements
spacex,not_removed,good point thanks
spacex,not_removed,of the spacex failures was the result of a second stage issue out of
spacex,not_removed,and every other source points to it being simply to supplement the holddowns so far shotwell is the only one to mention anything other than purely holding it down and even then she used kind of vague terminology
spacex,not_removed,it would cost them the slot at that time but it wouldnt prevent that launch from happening later so the only cost would be one of time delay which already happens although in this case it would be delaying clients in the backlog for i guess a vanity project i suppose spacex could try and sell it along the lines of well if we do this launch and it works well we can increase cadence in the future but yeah
spacex,not_removed,but there is a flight that should have gon up in april for iridium and it has been shifted to june
spacex,not_removed,where is it being displayed just curious
spacex,not_removed,i imagine even the scrap price of such a rocket is way more significant than the amount of money in my personal bank account although it might not be enough to pay for all the recovery logistics
spacex,not_removed,too lazy im sure someone else with more competence than me will be able to find a source for you
spacex,not_removed,so the only cost would be one of time delay which already happens and will still happen if you use a slot for one thing you cant use it for another as long as slots are in short supply every one is worth the revenue it could have brought in
spacex,not_removed,outside the spacex hq in hawthorne its an awesome sight
spacex,not_removed,he didnt say that he did say in the ama that theres not much point to do more than a couple of reflights of this version of falcon because block is on the horizon and it will be much easier for reuse im guessing thats what you meant and besides we already know that two flightproven will be used as side boosters on falcon heavy demo flight
spacex,not_removed,but you dont lose that revenue as long as you dont lose the customer eventually you still get the money the risk i think is more losing the customer by doing something that would seem potentially unnecessary
spacex,not_removed,i guess so thats weird i swear he said theyd be retired ah well thanks for the correction
spacex,not_removed,now if only shipping to europe wasnt € or more
spacex,not_removed,having all the burns visible in one shot makes that if im thinking of the right image my favorite launchlanding pic so far but i think these are all orbcomm do they have plans to do a compilation with photos from different launches later either way i think im going to have to buy this set in the meantime
spacex,not_removed,most excellent
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomspacex capture confirmed dragon now attached to the spacestation robotic arm this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,so could somebody outline what and how its being tested here it looks to me like loads are being applied axially down the spacecraft presumably to see if loads transmit as they should
spacex,not_removed,another photo on twitter lots of interesting vignetting editand another on instagram
spacex,not_removed,woo real windows
spacex,not_removed,looks like the windows are rotated a bit relative to the rest of the pressure vessel i wonder why that is
spacex,not_removed,from in crew dragon the crewcarrying version of the upgraded dragon spacecraft will restore the united states capability to fly humans to orbit the backbone of dragon is a metallic welded pressure vessel spacex has completed manufacturing of the first two pressure vessels to be used for ground testing and is currently manufacturing two crew dragon flight articles the pressure vessel is the primary structure of the spacecraft that protects astronauts during ascent while in outer space and during entry and landing to provide a safe and controlled environment in which to travel and work here is a picture of the first test article undergoing structural load testing this demonstrates the spacecrafts ability to withstand the tremendous forces its exposed to during space flight when we transport astronauts on crew dragon to the international space station next year it will be within one of these pressure vessels that over the coming months will turn into a fully functional spacecraft

spacex,not_removed,thats a thing of beauty right there itd be interesting to see exactly how much of a typical flight they can simulate on the ground
spacex,not_removed,those vertical structural elements are definitely placeholders imho they look too simple they were changed at some point during the first few dragons here is and are connected to the blue hold downs or same test article
spacex,not_removed,they are posting to instagram twitter facebook with whom do we have to talk so the post official releases to reddit also p
spacex,not_removed,i cant picture this help me out it appears that this is elongated significantly from what i imagined initially i thought it was including the trunk but upon further inspection it looks like it is the capsule only maybe i am wrongi figure the prop tanks and life support are stored between the grey structures what goes in the center cylinder below the crew compartment more fuel or is there more pressurized space in there looking at past vid of dragon this looks elongated also looking at dragon you can compare from this video where you can see the pressure vessel when the parachutes were tested looking at the presentation video you can see the door on the mockup in relation to the door on these pictures there seems to be more capsule
spacex,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment i love this kind of stuff this dragon testing looks fairly straight forward compared to fighter aircraft testing which have more points for pushpull actuators and it isnt covered in weights here is how it looks in action loo this video is minutes of a variety of aeronautical stress testing it is silent but is well woth the watch i cant picture this help me out it appears that this is elongated significantly from what i imagined initially i thought it was including the trunk but upon further inspection it looks like it is the capsule only maybe i am wrongi figure the p im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit

spacex,not_removed,why was this deleted
spacex,not_removed,this dragon testing looks fairly straight forward compared to httpiimgurcomemkxaxbjpg which have more points for pushpull actuators and it httpiimgurcomjjhfmwqpng here is how it looks looks like it has actuators on top and on the sides
spacex,not_removed,take out that orig and it might work with res
spacex,not_removed,but they put it where the hatch with explosive bolts goes
spacex,not_removed,it looks kind of cracked could also just be a reflection or stuff inside
spacex,not_removed,good eye they are indeed tilted towards the door this is probably because the superdraco engines would be mounted nearby and the contour of the outer panels is curved so as to not form a sharp inside corner it needs to be streamlined with the engine pods
spacex,not_removed,are you talking about the bottom of the window is a little farther out from pressure vessel than the top of the window is i kept trying to figure out how a round window gets rotated i get it tilted towards the door that makes a lot more sense
spacex,not_removed,when we transport astronauts on crew dragon to the international space station next year it will be within one of these pressure vessels that over the coming months will turn into a fully functional spacecraft i would assume they mean the aforementioned two crew dragon flight articles not reusing a static testing pressure vessel wording is not perfect as that sentence follows description of the static testing articles
spacex,not_removed,what i want to know is where i can buy that tape i assume that it has permanent adhesive so would be far more useful for retaining cables that typical duckductgaffer tape is
spacex,not_removed,note the small window the small window is also apparent in the interior photos
spacex,not_removed,as well as the internal air pressure and forces from rcs attitude control
spacex,not_removed,the top hatch is also the mechanical link between dragon and iss if one of them moves the hatch will take the load needed to move the other
spacex,not_removed,also bendingwarping from horizontaloffaxis accelerations
spacex,not_removed,probably vibration during launch and reenter too
spacex,not_removed,im sure its just a rig for the pressure vessel testing notice the connection points for the hydraulic actuators
spacex,not_removed,they also look way too massive to be flown as part of capsule where mass is crucial
spacex,not_removed,you mean the triangular panel thingies around the base of the capsule i dont see why they couldnt be flight hardware its definitely part of the test as those connect the heatshield to the rest of the pressure vessel
spacex,not_removed,im not an engineer but surely a more mature design with higher strength and less stuffmass is a potential
spacex,not_removed,the one on the far right in photo looks like it has had some computational optimisation compared to the one on the left visible which is based on a simple hexagonal tiling so it looks like its still being refined but i suspect the one on the right is close to the final design
spacex,not_removed,i mean its here within minutes anyways why do the extra work theyre spacex media people they have elons slideshow to make a falcon heavy promo video to shoot and webcasts to prepare haha
spacex,not_removed,its just the capsule without the bottom panels continue the conic section down with bumpouts for the thrusters keeping in mind that the heat shield curves up and it looks like youd expect though a dragon seems to be a bit taller in the service section than dragon to provide more space for the propulsion system keep in mind that the photo is from a low angle tanks and unpressurized systems are placed between the baffles at the bottom we dont precisely know whats in the lower part of the pressure vessel but is likely to be most of the pressurized systems like computers and life support they may also have the movable ballast system in there
spacex,not_removed,id say their testing facility in mcgregor texas
spacex,not_removed,the post or instagram i still see both
spacex,not_removed,is minutes of a variety of aeronautical stress testing it is silent but is well woth the watch
spacex,not_removed,i used to fly light airplanes with the atc and i swear if my wings had flexed that much in flight
spacex,not_removed,if i take out the orig you wont get the full res vs

spacex,not_removed,engine pods one of my favourite aerospace words httpsenwikipediaorgwikinacelle
spacex,not_removed,looking at the pic from below it appears one side of the window is nearly flush and the other is sticking out a couple inches perhaps that is what he meant by rotated
spacex,not_removed,more artisticfigurative sentiment than precise description iow they wont be turning the test articles into flight articles but rather the flight article structurespressure vessels that are being built not pictured will be turned into fully functional spacecraft
spacex,not_removed,these are higher resolution
spacex,not_removed,just speed tape and kapton tape both are good at taping things kapton is more for electrical aluminum for insulation considering this is just testing im sure the speed tape was used just because they have a bunch of it
spacex,not_removed,youve got to see whos knocking
spacex,not_removed,damn no more windows of same size
spacex,not_removed,but is this test testing for those forces the test seems axial not radial or otherwise asymmetrical

spacex,not_removed,meanwhile httpistackimgurcomlehvujpg
spacex,not_removed,i fly an a glider thats notorious for having floppy wings theyre nice to have as they tend to absorb turbulence but it took me about a dozen flights before i stopped freaking out at the constant bouncing up and down
spacex,not_removed,or change res to open all links in new tab no center click will work even with that weird button imac mouse
spacex,not_removed,i wouldnt exactly call them nacelles nacelles are separated from the fuselage the superdraco pods stick out a bit but are still mostly inside the wall
spacex,not_removed,yeah
spacex,not_removed,couldnt the bot be changed to actually post the highres versions
spacex,not_removed,that is exactly what i wanted thanks
spacex,not_removed,in all seriousness i wonder if they are going to have a knock code like the one for soyuz capsules httpwwwspacerefcomisssoyuzsclsabeditpdf given dragons use of hypergolics and possibly exploding hatches the approach guidelines for a downed craft might be similar
spacex,not_removed,reminds me of the ending to the apollo movie where the swimmer is knocking on the doors window and tom hanks gives him a thumbs up
spacex,not_removed,the purpose of such testing aside from verifying nominal behavior during anticipated nominal loads is to subject the test vehicle to forces that are far beyond andor outside of the range of expected loads hence unusual ie axial load testing ought to be expected even if it isnt likely to be experienced also it is likely useful to compare reality with their own computer modeling and thus refine their physics models for the spacex does have a tendency to push physics modeling of rocketry
spacex,not_removed,might be reentry foreces who know its probably shot mid setup and all the actuators arent set up yet
spacex,not_removed,been there what a useless feature
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,no because the higherresolution images werent from instagram they were from fb twitter
spacex,not_removed,that was an interesting read
spacex,not_removed,ehh its helpful for clearing your front page or rall of content youre not interested in seeing its the worst when you accidentally hit and dont notice though
spacex,not_removed,sweet mother of god not even the bendiest foamie model airplane can manage that o looks like im gonna be having fun with the structures module in my aerospace degree next year lol
spacex,not_removed,doing seriously aircraft are getting pretty wiggly if you ride an watch a wing on takeoff they shift from bending way down to bending way up perfectly normal
spacex,not_removed,fair enough
spacex,not_removed,behold the magic of cfrp
spacex,not_removed,not only that but if youre sitting at the front or back of the plane look down the aisle when landing youll see the entire fuselage flex and shudder when the wheels touch down
spacex,not_removed,the less stiff you can make an airplane wing and still have it be safe and functional the more lightweight it can be which in turn means less fuel consumption huzzah
spacex,not_removed,so kerbal spaghettiplanes are accurate or will be soon
spacex,not_removed,welcome to the future where everything is made of composites ultralightweight metal alloys or inconellike superalloys

spacex,not_removed,unfortunately this isnt new information despite getting the spacex seal of approval you can post this in the comments of the if youd like
spacex,not_removed,technically he only says that the engines are capable of putting out lbs of thrust not that they are doing so on the other hand that could be a reason why they had that one engine striped to check the results of a higher thrust merlin during launch
spacex,not_removed,technically it is the same engine they just discovered after so many flights that it was more capable than originally thought all they would have to do to use the increased thrust is tweak the software i could see them doing that to shrink their gravity losses a little and add margin for the landing even then they landed a little harder than they intended
spacex,not_removed,if you want us to flair this as sources required to prevent people responding with i thinktype comments let us know
spacex,not_removed,maybe look in this thread citing urocket now that the httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwpyotcfslkw is out we can see the timestamps and speeds of the launches missionmeco timemeco speedmeco altitudeentry burn startupentry burn cutoff what i believe this shows is that the launch trajectory was most similar not to but to with the exception that the entry burn started seconds earlier this seconds difference means an about msec difference in the postburn speed msec for msec for thaicom this might seem a small difference but in terms of drag it made the landing an almost less energetic this is further backed by the fact that despite having almost the exact same meco speed and altitude as appears to have landed about seconds later than so this launch had almost the same meco speed and altitude of but landed a bit later due to different reentry burns this suggests that the engines had the same thrust as the ones used in the launch on the other hand the things you concluded in the post also make sense i guess we will have to wait for someone who knows a bit more or an official statement
spacex,not_removed,why are you using seconds when in the body you say seconds that alone gets us to which since we are assuming an average acceleration means that is the minimum value for the maximum acceleration note that that is only a difference from lbf silly bot

spacex,not_removed,maybe you have mixed twr and thrust more twr gives the expression of having more thrust even though it doesnt thaicom is the lightest satelite launched on the falcon ft with a of vs the heaviest satelite twr thrust in kn total mass in kg thaicom twr twr dry mass dragon thaicom did in fact have a slightly higher twr but i have watched and thaicom liftoff multiple times simultaneously and i see no difference has said that the fullerthrust merlin will fly later this year he cant be serious that it will happen so soon can he in the he says the rocket is capable of million pounds of thrust indicating that the thrust upgrade is not applied yet
spacex,not_removed,that would make sense but the thrust difference is which is more than even two fullerthrust merlins could cause unless theres some more complex testing going on that only spacex knows about
spacex,not_removed,right thats pretty much what it is imo what im saying is that this thrust increase may be related to the one elon teased a few weeks ago and that brings the payload capacity to the magical edit im referring to this
spacex,not_removed,that might be useful thanks i can imagine that a topic like this could potentially spark a lot of such comments
spacex,not_removed,okay i have an answer for you turns out that their meco time and speed are the same because the thaicom booster throttles down just before meco about seconds oh by the way the meco speeds in that table seem pretty off mecod at which is msec not according to my estimates had it not throttled down it would have reacher msec by oh and mecod at msec not i went over the video quite carefully and the speeds in that table seem just plain wrong im not sure why
spacex,not_removed,looking at the videos it seems like the jcsat stage is running at a higher throttle throughout the latter portion of the flight suggesting that the potentially upgraded thaicom booster was throttled down more in that part of the flight well i think it might be worthwhile plugging a few numbers into a graph to see whats going on but im still confident that the thaicom booster put out more thrust than it is rated for during the earlier portion of the flight while the jcsat did not
spacex,not_removed,so this launch had almost the same meco speed and altitude of but landed a bit later due to different reentry burns this suggests that the engines had the same thrust as the ones used in the launch do both payloads have a similar mass
spacex,not_removed,i went ahead and wrote up that math given ti intial time tf final time acceleration due to gravity earth sea level average rti position at r is used for position by convention vithiacom initial velocity of thiacom initial velocity of vfthiacom final velocity of thiacom final velocity of mthiacom mass of thiacom falcon mass of falcon reqd ththaicom avg thrust of thiacom avg thrust of assume point mass we can treat the rocket as a point mass v nonrelativistic speeds so newtonian mechanics is ok constant acceleration mass thrust soln from newtons second law f ma the force we are interested in is thrust th ma we have multiple accelerations to consider net accleration is the sum of acceleration due to gravity and the acceleration on the rocket due to the engines anet g a positive y is up a is accel on rocket due to engines implies that a anet g acceleration is defined as the time rate of change of velocity means implies means is defined as anet dvdt dv anet dt a bit of harmless calculus integrating from vi to vf and ti to tf vf vi anettf ti a bit of harmless calculus solving for anet anet vf vi tf ti combining and th m vf vi tf ti g ti and vi are both zero so th m vftf g in newtons a very big number conversion factor apply unit conversion to eqn multiply both sides by substitute for on right side th m vftf g in kn using we can plug and chug thiacom case ththaicom ththaicom kn case kn results ththaicom kn kn we can also consider the case where the acceleration is constant but the mass of the rocket obvioulsy varies given ispsl sea level isp useful equations ve avg exhaust velocity is the product of acceleration due to gravity and isp th vemdot thrust is avg exhaust velocity times the mass flow rate of the propellant soln implies mdot th ve substitute into mdot th mass as a function of time is the original mass less the product of the mass flow rate times time mt mdott substitute into simplify mt th th substitute into for m then solve for th yields this takes more algebra than i care to typeset so it is left as an exercise for the reader tht tfispttvf plugging and chugging for two values of t for thiacom using results this result shows that the average thrust assuming constant mass and constant acceleration is off a few percent from the case where mass isnt constant to get the actual average thrust you could find the average of left as an exercise
spacex,not_removed,oh good catch i did say seconds in the body that was a typo though and i did mean seconds so the math remains unchanged
spacex,not_removed,there are a few flaws with that logic if i may first of all i actually accounted for the difference in mass between and thaicom in my calculations to quote my own post the weight discrepancy vs is to guessaccommodate for the heavier payload dragon that has a negligible effect on the final thrust anyway so being incredibly accurate in getting the mass right isnt an issue second of all that logic of comparing weight doesnt seem to work since it would mean that would launch faster than any other falcon mission ive gone over and its still noticeably slower than yesterdays launch finally you may be right that this isnt a falcon fully equipped with merlin as in this isnt the final upgrade but theres clearly at least some more thrust going on here i think we witnessed either a flight of engines at lowered thrust for testing purposes or that spacex threw in only engines so they could test them safely either way im fairly confident that this bird had more thrust only spacex knows how and why that happened im just saying what i saw
spacex,not_removed,numbers seem like they should be in the margin of error for this discussion if you take the given thrust of and calculate the per engine figure you get ft if you assume they want to check some flight characteristics of the upgrade before risking it on all engines a sensible approach would be to run outer engines to keep things balanced given that a total expected thrust in that configurations would be ft upgrade which isnt far from given all the assumptions also if there were stripped engines assuming these were instrumented then the one opposite the known one would have been obscured by the strong back so i think trying out engines was a possibility
spacex,not_removed,done
spacex,not_removed,oh by the way the meco speeds in that table seem pretty off mecod at which is msec not according to my estimates had it not throttled down it would have reacher msec by oh and mecod at msec not indeed i think i mixed up the and the speed numbers ive edited the table to correct for that what really mattered to my argument was to make sure that the jcsat and the meco speeds and altitudes were pretty close to each other within msec i went over the video quite carefully and the speeds in that table seem just plain wrong im not sure why i believe that is because the telemetry data comes in via a downrange receiver ocisly and is piped up to a satellite while the tv picture of the webcast comes from cape canaveral so theres a couple of seconds of pipelining delay between the data and what happens in the video so the way i estimated meco speeds was to framestep to the maximum speed of each ascents
spacex,not_removed,paging urocket seems your table may be off
spacex,not_removed,the payloads are close enough in mass to cause an difference in mass of just so for our purposes yes they do but the assumption being made in that quote is incorrect given that the thaicom booster throttled down before meco its also not necessarily a good argument given that theres so many more factors that could influence meco telemetry the data in my post used come from the first seconds of the flight where things like engine throttling there isnt any throttling going on and aerodynamics too slow arent a factor that could distort data
spacex,not_removed,there is a fundamental flaw in your assumption that lift off is at thrust shows that liftoff is at thrust and ramps to thrust after about seconds which is the period of time you are analysing so minor changes in this ramp will lead to an assumption of more thrust which may not be valid it is generally assumed that the thrust at lift off is to avoid acoustic issues and the ramp to full thrust occurs when the rocket has cleared the reflection zone from the groundflame trench
spacex,not_removed,agreed engines are close enough to be a sensible conclusion besides the can handle losing two later in flight anyway so it wouldnt be too big a risk we didnt see two striped engines which is what i find confusing but then again its not like its spacexs job to mark every single engine theyre testing just so we could tell the markings dont even have to refer to engines with more thrust its certainly a possibility but whether weve seen or fullerthrust merlins its good to see progress when it comes to engine upgrades
spacex,not_removed,maybe those were the two outer engines used along with the center engine on the reentrylanding burns
spacex,not_removed,it strikes me as incredibly dumb to have to cite a source to question a contradiction in the ops post especially when it involves basic math or physics are we to cite our old college texts
spacex,not_removed,i think it might be useful to let us know what sources required entails and how it stops people responding with i thinktype comments im newish to reddit sorry and barely know what a flair is let alone the aim of sources required
spacex,not_removed,oh thanks for the insight into meco estimates i never thought of that
spacex,not_removed,the data in my post used come from the first seconds of the flight where things like engine throttling there isnt any throttling going on and aerodynamics too slow arent a factor that could distort data i think that claim is demonstrably wrong past missions that showed throttling data showed us that the falcon takes off with an about throttle setting and gradually ramps up in the first seconds the speculation is that this is done to reduce acoustic damage done by reflecting and possible standing waves created between the engine bells and the launch platform once a certain very small altitude is achieved this stops being a concern
spacex,not_removed,of initial mass or of mass at meco
spacex,not_removed,thats a fair point and is admittedly something i havent taken into account but this difference in thrust persists even after not directly included in my post but noticeable in the graph ive referenced at the bottom besides the liftoff thrust that ive calculated for the thaicom mission is already higher than what the is rated for at let alone all this makes me think there might be more to it than a change in throttling but as ive probably already said somewhere in this thread only spacex knows exactly whats going on
spacex,not_removed,i see it as just a precaution to help avoid replies like i disagree because i dont think spacex would do that you know pure speculation im sure that if anyone questions my basic physics in a way that makes sense their post wont get deleted although if someone did actually cite their old college texts to question my basic calculations id be pretty damn impressed
spacex,not_removed,and the way i tried to estimate meco timestamp was to look at the official tx timestamp in the telemetry window if telemetry data like altitude and speed are synchronized to the clock then this is the right way to measure meco time i assumed that it is so but is might still be an assumption that might be wrong id also argue that the merlin performance wont be upped for geo missions from a simple risk assessment meta point of view i think they will try it first with a higher fuel margin leo mission if anything unexpected happens such as one or two engine failures then those have a much higher chance to still complete to a successful mission with high energy geo launches theres a much lower margin of error
spacex,not_removed,true someone addressed that in this thread already the falcon does indeed throttle at liftoff that doesnt explain the calculated average thrust being beyond the rated but it is something i didnt notice until putting the results on a graph a bit later
spacex,not_removed,of initial mass about of the mass at meco
spacex,not_removed,one of the spacex guys quoted pounds of thrust during the webcast
spacex,not_removed,i was going to do that not to question your physics just the use of seconds but to derive and explain everything as im sure we have redditors that dont have a background in math or physics but i think ill forego that now this sources required has left a foul taste in my mouth next time perhaps
spacex,not_removed,that doesnt explain the calculated average thrust being beyond the rated how did you get to a rated thrust of the at throttle setting is kn of those engines give kn
spacex,not_removed,maybe we should replace sources required with some tag like no speculation or datasources required or calculations or sources required to make it clear that that sort of thing is acceptable in this sort of thread
spacex,not_removed,dude youre getting upset over a tag its obvious the intention is not to remove physics or math
spacex,not_removed,itll be after the upgrade the merlin as it is run in the current puts out as per echo and elon who says that the upgrade will happen later this year if you convert lbs to kn and divide by
spacex,not_removed,what about people commenting about something they dislike about ops calculations that is neither source or data no speculation doesnt fit either since it would be a speculation there is stuff to be learned if someone can ask a question or point out a potential issue and the op or someone else explains why they are wrong i would say the normal no low effort or meme posts handles all issues and any kind of tag has no point
spacex,not_removed,when reading some other threads ive actually been wondering whether an informed speculation flair might be really useful and it might actually capture better whats going on in this thread here too indeed many of the threads that i enjoy reading the most are of this type ironically including this thread which i dont think was accurately characterized by the op as wild as it was based on a published paper and some speculative but informed maths the informed speculation flair might also then be something that you mods simply put on such a thread to indicate why youve let it through and reinforce the message that only informed high effort and interesting speculation is tolerated in the subreddit which is great the only problem with the effort you guys put into quality control is thats its probably why i end up spending far too much time reading rspacex
spacex,not_removed,to be clear i wasnt upset or even mad i was frustrated by the restrictions that come with the sources required tag specifically the lack of intelligence of the bot in charge for example i was waiting for a reply from the op to my question about versus for some time before i finally left to check out other threads that was when the mail notification showed up and i found out the bot had deleted my question so i was waiting for a reply that would never otherwise come as the op would never otherwise see my question for clarification so i edited my question throwing in a link to the main thread and messaged the mods about having my post undeleted which they promptly and politely did i was also going to make another comment deriving and explaining the ops math for those without a math or physics background but the frustration dampened my desire to do that certainly the world can get along just fine without my posts though i suspect some might have found value in such a post i understand the reasoning behind sources required i just dont think the current implementation gets the job done
spacex,not_removed,itll be after the upgrade indeed you are right i still think your figure is incorrect and i found the correct number on spacexs site the upgrade will happen later this year if you convert lbs to kn and divide by you get kn if you convert lbf to kn and divide it by but as kn they list vacuum thrust as higher that sl thrust is higher than the kn figure you cited so if we use spacexs own thrust numbers do the discrepancies you noticed go away
spacex,not_removed,uhh to respond to the first part of your answer my math may be wrong but i seem to be getting if i take lbf lbf is imo irrelevant at this point and is elon talking about some distant future or theoretical capability lbf gives me just fine are you sure about your math as i said i could be wrong but googles unit convertor seems to be on my side yes those discrepancies go away if we use spacexs own thrust numbers but spacexs own thrust numbers actually take the even fuller thrust upgrade into account and are therefore higher than the ones we saw on previous missions because those flew a not an evenfuller thrust ill refer to it that way for now proof these upgraded thrust numbers do match my figures so the discrepancies do go away but that just proves my point since those figures on spacexs website are of a not the as indicated by elon in that tweet
spacex,not_removed,you get kn if you convert lbf to kn and divide it by your math is wrong here lbf knlbf kn kn
spacex,not_removed,well one lbf is kn to httpwwwendmemocomsconvertknlbfphp sources i httpwwwtraditionalovencomtutorialsforceconvertpoundforcelbfunittokilonewtonknforceunithtml which gives kn kn could you link to the formula you are using
spacex,not_removed,thats what i get too but then you divide by so so lbf is per engine the upgraded thrust of corresponding to the figures i came up with in my calculations while you said that it equaled to lbf hence my correction were you by any chance dividing by instead of
spacex,not_removed,but then you divide by so so lbf is per engine the upgraded thrust of yeah indeed you are right
spacex,not_removed,what has been your favorite spacex launch so far users i have no words xd
spacex,not_removed,it has taken even longer than last year but the results of the subreddit survey are finally here we have received more than the year before entries of which were deemed valid as last year a single invalid entry resulted in the entire answer being thrown away to keep the data consistent then number of answers we received was quite surprising since between the and surveyshttpredditmetricscomrspacex but only about more people entered into the survey that means the response rate dropped to from last years also like last year weve made available an anonymized table of results so people can crowdsource interesting graphscorrelations what were the results httpsimgurcomawwgfi for reference here are past survey results httpsimgurcomakulae main points were getting younger again us california domination is less so than it was one year ago again was awesome still were eagerly awaiting falcon heavy were less optimistic about prices and more optimistic about launch cadence the glorious date of mars landing remains the year we love the subreddit wiki boeing dont have a chance who won as we stated there was one price for a spacex tshirt this year people were assigned a value equal to their entry id in the survey spreadsheet and then randomorg was polled to produce results the winner is uwitwicky who won an httpsshopspacexcommenstshirtsoccupymarstshirthtml congratulations entry well pm our winner and will make arrangements from there wrapping up of course statistics can be misleading this was obviously not a community census and only polled a proportion of people equal to of the community thank you all for participating see you all next year
spacex,not_removed,it would be interesting to also see the country data presented in a percapita format to me it looks like that of the countries included on the pie chart measured in redditors per capita new zealand is highest and norway second fjords and rockets somehow the given countries measured in spacex redditors per million inhabitants new zealand norway netherlands denmark sweden australia canada finland usa czech republic ireland switzerland austria belgium uk germany poland france spain argentina italy brazil russia india edit completed the list corrected ireland was too low
spacex,not_removed,predicting that the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinterplanetarytransportsystem will fly before the httpsenwikipediaorgwikispacelaunchsystem is fairly surprising seeing as most of its components are and its set to launch on
spacex,not_removed,thanks for producing this that almost total lack of female representation is pretty depressing
spacex,not_removed,apologies if this sounds like a moan it is intended to be constructive i note the comment that the response rate seems low for the number of reddit users and also some later comment about the small number of older users i am a huge fan of rspacex but i didnt respond to the subreddit survey i normally pride myself on giving feedback where practical as i know how valuable it is for any group or endeavour certainly via anything in writing and sometimes even those annoying telephone market research type calls if they are related to something i feel i have some input on the subreddit survey description seemed to a require a google account b be very long and c have no useful validation to ensure the feedback would be accepted you lost me right there i dont have a google account alright i could get one but i dont really need one to add to all my other cloud services long ok to a point no validation you cannot be serious i bet the people whose carefully crafted responses were ignored are thrilled about the entire answer being thrown away to keep the data consistent i work in it and am very comfortable with software i am also years old and have plenty of things i can be doing with what is left of my precious time responding to overly complex poorly validated feedback forms is not one of them how about next year hang the consistency and use something like surveymonkey to structure and validate the feedback and see what sort of response you get then i promise ill respond to that one

spacex,not_removed,itss first launch on december got votes damn just missed the deadline
spacex,not_removed,hmm speaking of the subreddit what is httpiimgurcomumibjglpng image overlay supposed to do kinda distracts from reading the comments
spacex,not_removed,the age breakdown explains a lot of the posting here
spacex,not_removed,is there something wrong with the percentages shouldnt they add up to in pie charts
spacex,not_removed,female users
spacex,not_removed,ses is streaming a press conference on periscope right now interesting info kg realistic possibility that mission will slip to the essentially no change in insurance cost for the mission
spacex,not_removed,i think some of the results were predictable the participants per state graph isnt really helpful as it implies that certain states have more interest in the survey what might be more interesting is a bar graph showing the ratio of participants in a state vs the population of that state then we can determine if is is more popular in certain states of weather the original graph is merely reflecting state population
spacex,not_removed,its fun that very few think there will be a prime number of launches
spacex,not_removed,i didnt see the survey so i did not participate but im i am surprised at the low amount that is under kind of sad to be honest but what do you expect

spacex,not_removed,regarding the cost of a falcon launch in the future is it really that likely for this to decrease until the competition also begins to reuse rockets or launch cadence skyrockets if spacex has years of launches left to do then they have no reason to reduce prices even if they dramatically reduce their costs to launch
spacex,not_removed,so theres two people trying to be hip
spacex,not_removed,still consistently male here hmm
spacex,not_removed,was quite popular too also think that many confused launches one and two dont see much reason why launch would be so popular otherwise
spacex,not_removed,competitors employees
spacex,not_removed,larger axis labels would make the graphs much easier to read
spacex,not_removed,on participants by subscription date you should add not subscribed as odd as it may sound many of us dont subscribe to subreddits just visit them when something interesting is going on or it pops in our mind
spacex,not_removed,participants by subscription date should probably be a histogram not a bar given the intervals are not all the same length
spacex,not_removed,thanks for doing this as you highlight the relatively small self selecting sample means theres no guaranteeing anything is representative of the readers of the sub but an interesting exercise never the less
spacex,not_removed,norway second fjords and rockets somehow i think it might be more fjords and teslas and then people end up finding out about spacex through that norway has the highest number of teslas of any country as of i believe this is still very much the case
spacex,not_removed,dat echologic effect
spacex,not_removed,thanks for doing this when i seen new zealand way down there i was surprised what for having its own space start up i immediately wondered per x people what the s would look like
spacex,not_removed,new zealand was the highest per capita last time too and norway was pretty high up i dont remember if it was second
spacex,not_removed,wow czech republic is surprisingly high on that list goes to show our high prospace sentiments i mean being the third nation to ever be in space
spacex,not_removed,haha im one of thirty belgians onhere most exclusive club ill ever belong to
spacex,not_removed,new zealand represent when i saw the nz numbers i just started compiling this list before reading the comments then found you had already done it thanks i think the population size might have more to do with it than teslas we kiwis are the smallest country with norway and denmark second and third respectively as for teslas we have only just opened our first tesla store with only a small independent charging network i think it may also have something to do with the fact that being known as kiwis after a flightless bird we have a point to prove and rockets help us dream
spacex,not_removed,i wonder why france cares so little
spacex,not_removed,i think some people still just dont believe itll fly at all ie that itll be cancelled the past couple months of a lack of such indications from trump would probably change those results quite a bit
spacex,not_removed,i was also surprised i though the general consensus was that fh would fly before sls and that sls would fly before its now i will grant that its might conceivably fly before sls block but i just dont see any scenario where its would fly before sls block if anything im worried that sls block might manage to squeeze in their first test flight before fh thus blocking fh from ever holding the title of most powerful rocket flying
spacex,not_removed,the sept date for sls is fantasy its no longer even under consideration internally but dont expect a nasa announcement until as late as possible hasnt been for a few months now try mid as the new very optimistic date now i answered that sls will fly first because the question asked about the its booster but im fairly confident the spaceship portion will be doing flight tests before and if nasa does end up making manned id bet ob the its booster flying first as well
spacex,not_removed,i always expected something of this sort but freaking percent im dumbfounded
spacex,not_removed,and suprising is just insane i didnt look at the previous statistics but i would have expected is that so unreasonable
spacex,not_removed,may i ask why that is a problem why not let people just choose for themselves what they are interested in
spacex,not_removed,for the most part thats reddit in general edit i stand corrected maybe i just browse a lot of maledominated subs
spacex,not_removed,amen i dont understand why rockets and space in general is such a male thing growing up in the plenty of girls i knew loved space thanks to things like space camp space shuttles and the aliens franchise i never really thought it was a gender thing until now
spacex,not_removed,if you look at it this way of the of rspacex members that actually filled in the survey of those were female you could conclude females dont do surveys
spacex,not_removed,rocketry aint feminine enough yet unfortunately however i salute that of females who care about stuff like space and colonisation and fate of mankind
spacex,not_removed,i dont mean to get off topic or act like youre that one little weird fellow in the corner but i am curious how do you not have a google account its the most visited website it provides email for a large majority of internet users it is used for countless things from document collaboration to photo sharing and it is absolutely ubiquitous in an internetconnected world it also isnt a social media site which would make sense to intentionally avoid i dont have a facebook account because i do not want to be part of that and the amount of information they collect goes only as far as you use your account and it has fine grained controls over your privacy settings even if you dont connect it together and fill out your personal google ecosystem it still seems very surprising that any regular internet user would not have a google account i cannot understand the reasoning behind why someone would avoid making one even for minimal usage since its just a way to do small things like write document or store files or answer surveys which requires minimal data disclosure since im very curious about this would you mind sharing your reasoning
spacex,not_removed,i dont have a google account alright i could get one but i dont really need one to add to all my other cloud services this is the reason i didnt take part in the survey despite wanting to as an older redditor at i am leery of having to many accounts at the rate large hacks keep happening we as in older folks want a smaller chance of getting hit
spacex,not_removed,wow so many people think that the its will launch before with a huge number thinking it will launch this year even i feel like a lot of votes could be discarded this effect could be reduced by not including a potential reward for the survey sure it would mean less votes in total but the remainder would at least be more credible
spacex,not_removed,thats a css bug definitely not intended behavior would you kindly modmail us with more information or submit an issue to the httpsgithubcomlukenzspacexredditcss
spacex,not_removed,rounding errors
spacex,not_removed,among the survey respondees yes extrapolating means roughly on the entire sub still depressingly low
spacex,not_removed,people generally lump their estimates into round numbers like or or or
spacex,not_removed,id hope for more people at the other end of the age spectrum too lots of old nasa guys people that saw the moon landing live startrek fans etc one would hope that theyd want to keep up with the cutting edge of spaceflight im not so surprised at the lack of olds though the sub can be a bit dry and a lot of your age group wouldnt have come across spacex in universities though ive come across total strangers talking about this subreddit
spacex,not_removed,i came across this sub a year ago when i was after reading about airplane missiles in wikipedia i was a fan of the at the time and somehow ended up on an article about the falcon heavy still feeling kind of sad that my most of my classmates dont even know that they dont fly the space shuttles anymore tho
spacex,not_removed,youre referring to the audience and not the mods right might be related yes though i dont think the offenders would be participating in the survey
spacex,not_removed,i have no idea what youre talking about this subreddit is filled with people who know a shit ton about spaceflight the discussions are very serious and informative this is the most professional subreddit i know i really dont get your point
spacex,not_removed,dont see much reason why launch would be so popular otherwise i thought that bottom segment of the pie chart was launch as well but then realised it was actually a bit of the legend overlaid it was that was the second most popular
spacex,not_removed,orbcomm was the first controlled splashdown of a first stage iirc but i think you are probably correct
spacex,not_removed,and what im getting out of this is that this community really loves catastrophic helium leaks big helium must be shilling
spacex,not_removed,jeff bezos and his minions obviously
spacex,not_removed,also pie charts are pretty garbage when used for items bar charts might not look as nice but they are much more effective for comparing components of a total relative to each other
spacex,not_removed,youre right i remember having the same problem in the first survey i entered as well well have that option in the next survey thanks
spacex,not_removed,new zealand is also famous we spell them differently but until november could not buy teslas without private import jiggery pokery
spacex,not_removed,i am from norway and found out about spacex and tesla at the same through reddit i did not however become interested in spacex until after i purchased my own tesla so i think your assessment is spot on
spacex,not_removed,echologic is an effect not a cause of high kiwi participation grin
spacex,not_removed,rpercapitabragging
spacex,not_removed,third including suborbital germany then usa and ussr would be first to third i cant find anything about czechia though
spacex,not_removed,well the poll was of only about of the sub extrapolating puts it at about belgians out of subscribers
spacex,not_removed,i think the population size might have more to do with it than teslas we kiwis are the smallest country with norway and denmark second and third respectively i was thinking about that too but there are several countries that buck the trend for example ireland has a population size similar to new zealand but less than half the percapita ratio similarly the netherlands rank significantly above denmark and finland despite having more than three times the population of either several httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofeuropeancountriesbypopulation are also missing entirely even though with a percapita ratio similar to the top of this list they should have made the cut cutoff seems to be at and redditors canada and australia also have relatively high ratios so in sum im not sure but i wont make a more thorough analysis to find out p
spacex,not_removed,just possibly because this is an english language site not saying that young male technically oriented from the survey demographics frenchmen do not speak and write english fluently just that culturally english is not their best loved language
spacex,not_removed,i agree that part of it is the expectation of cancellation that seems to be the most common history of nasa projects however another possibility is the disbelief of actual flight hardware most of the time when nasa or its contractors release a photo of something it is an engineering mockup or a manufacturing prototype or a stress test article the occurrence rate of the words flight hardware in a photo caption has been only slightly more frequent than confirmed sightings of snipes
spacex,not_removed,trump increased sls funding by like obviously people dont see that in the media
spacex,not_removed,block has a pretty good chance of never flying at all especially if its is successful
spacex,not_removed,for the record im not blaming this sub i think the rules about high quality posts actually help a lot as it avoids the kind of frat boy teenage humour that dominates a lot of reddit and makes the general chat more friendly but i think its probably a reflection of the persistent image of engineering as a boys club which is what i find depressing this needs to change
spacex,not_removed,reddit users followers of an intense engineering subject youre basically multiplying out the probability of female participation statistically speaking sadly
spacex,not_removed,apparently that is unreasonable indeed the difference between your estimate and reality is quite large you might not have taken a few factors into account
spacex,not_removed,because its not that women arent interested in stem its that there are various forces making it harder for them to get into a stem career and advance as well as men
spacex,not_removed,may i ask why that is a problem why not let people just choose for themselves what they are interested in like ugnaskar said spaceflight needs all the support it can get if of the population dont want anything to do with the spaceflight industry that is a massive pr problem no matter what your opinions on gender equality and affirmative action
spacex,not_removed,id say reddit has a surprisingly​ large female userbase
spacex,not_removed,not according to httpsenwikipediaorgwikiredditdemographics
spacex,not_removed,edit i stand corrected maybe i just browse a lot of maledominated subs yeah thats the same for me mostly into the spaceflight and ittech side of reddit but both of my female friends are regular redditors theyre just mostly in different areas i honestly really like that about reddit it caters to people with pretty much any interest and has discussions and communities for anyone about anything
spacex,not_removed,one needed to signup with an email to fill the survey which is completely unnecessary from my point of view happy to be proven wrong i dont know if it prevents women to fill this survey more than men but it sure made me pass on it
spacex,not_removed,i dont think rocketry is innately a masculine thing nor do i like the assumption that of females dont care about the fate of the human race we can do a better job being a little less of a boys club without making accusations like that
spacex,not_removed,since its just a way to do small things like write document or store files or answer surveys which requires minimal data disclosure hopefully the mods will indulge this reply in a thread about survey responses as we wait excitedly for workwise as a software developer i use mostly microsoft products which probably influences my approach i dont use google products to do any of those things you listed im probably more oldschool and prefer the control of some local apps for editing and use things like dropbox onedrive and flickr for sharing my isp does good webmail ive even warmed to facebook and found a way to use it that adds something to my life ive nothing against google as a company and use google and google related sites all the time search of course youtube translate occasionally maps and is there any browser other than chrome worth using but i am not aware of any substantial benefit which doesnt mean there isnt one i would gain from logging in to an account to use any of these maybe it remembers a few defaults for next time meh i dont need to write youtube comments or whatever and can use facebook to login to most things im also not at all bothered about the security aspect or no more than any other sites its perhaps significant that i use websites a lot more than apps even when accessed on my small mobile screen which is most of the time like now i hardly ever use the reddit app for example which like many other text based apps seem to just dumb everything down with double spaced text lots of images slower scrolling and yet another user interface to learn that im sure is wonderfully intuitive if you either wrote the app or use it all the time and are prepared to invest the time and energy in learning how to use it eg i just spent several minutes trying to exit the soundcloud app after wandering in to it from a link a browser just works returning rather circuitously it must be said to the topic of surveys i must have responded to literally a hundred online surveys of all sorts over the years and i have never needed google docs for any of them surveymonkey is the main tool i see used tldr there are a lot of different usage patterns and quite possibly there is an age related component to some of them perhaps worth bearing in mind if you want to pick the brains of us oldfartstm
spacex,not_removed,not the person you are asking but in my case i have one and i have no intention to link it to my reddit accountactivities
spacex,not_removed,the survey is more about what do individual subscribers to the subreddit think than what is the most realistic guess we can produce as an aggregate but point taken next year well tighten up our bounding a little more
spacex,not_removed,and several hundred think well have boots on mars before which is earlier even that spacexs most optimistic hopes many of them think it happen when theres no transfer window
spacex,not_removed,i mean the results are still basically speculation its fun to see but i dont think we should be drawing any serious conclusions from this prize or not
spacex,not_removed,i like it its a measure of how unrealistic or uninformed people are judging from the contents here id say its fairly accurate
spacex,not_removed,ahh i see an issue already open with this i replied with my browserres version info but not sure what else youd need
spacex,not_removed,gee thats a lot of rounding errors since theyre adding up to
spacex,not_removed,id hope for more people at the other end of the age spectrum too lots of old nasa guys people that saw the moon landing live startrek fans etc one would hope that theyd want to keep up with the cutting edge of spaceflight there could be a few factors at work among them its a self selected sample rather than randomly selected im mid watched the moon landings live on a tiny little grainy bw tv and was one of the first or so people on the net long before http which has become unfortunately conflated with the internet in common parlance existed i absolutely do still keep up with whats happening in space exploration particularly around unmanned planetary science and new launch platforms i read some fraction of this sub ulas nasas and listen to a set of space related podcasts however my chance of replying to a forum survey is small and if it requires use of google or fb in any capacity that chance becomes i will not use their services for any reason let alone a survey as well many older folks who keep up with space science do so on other platforms than this one there may be a strong platform correlation at work i do not know the degree to which such factors may impact the results but one might at least guess there are many younger folks interested in space i find that an agreeable thing to contemplate even if its a small of the population at large the base of support for space exploration isnt dying out with my generation as i once feared it might
spacex,not_removed,people that saw the moon landing live not a lot of redditors in there the population of rnfl which has broad appeal across ages is also shockingly young its just the platform
spacex,not_removed,wow thats funny seeing people talking about the subreddit around a uni haha i agree though surprising less old people than i would have expected maybe theres a myspace page for it lol
spacex,not_removed,i agree i saw an raptor in mass last year theyre really quite amazing
spacex,not_removed,i think that was
spacex,not_removed,as long as the main fractions are clearly visible and we have several different categories that naturally add to i dont see a problem with pie charts bars are not very nice especially as you dont see a bar that is the us bar to take the country of origin as example
spacex,not_removed,ah now i know why lotr was filmed there o
spacex,not_removed,the third nation to have its citizen in space vladimír remek but yeah it was soyuz launched by sssr most likely as an apology for the invasion in not that awesome when you think about it
spacex,not_removed,damn there goes my feeling of superiority
spacex,not_removed,maybe also because of pride in our space industry
spacex,not_removed,eh i was saying that trump hasnt shown any signs of cancelling sls
spacex,not_removed,yeah reddit in general engineering rocketengineering specifically that does it i guess
spacex,not_removed,well to be fair its definitely changing a decent amount of the engineering students at my college granted my schools program requires you transfer somewhere else in years to actually get the degree and theres maybe of us are women also literally the only stem organization on campus is women in stem make of that what you will obviously its not representative of the field at the moment but its definitely changing
spacex,not_removed,i never encountered the problem of engineering being imaged as a boys club is this a thing only in the us
spacex,not_removed,persistent image of engineering as a boys club are you an engineer
spacex,not_removed,yes but its not really that engineering is a mans job because anyone can be one just that men want to be them more these are just facts
spacex,not_removed,i dont understand the this needs to change part why does it i would say you should hire the best people and thats it and for this sub the best content should be on top hell you probably wouldnt know if i was a girl or not theres one change i would agree on which has to change and this is the school system in early years there are reasons why boys choose mint fields more often than girl and this needs to change for this sub and the industry no it dont has to change why does it matter if the outcome is good
spacex,not_removed,what a world we are living in that you need to point out that youre not blaming the sub for this lol all this political correctness everywhere no one is making a fuss over at rbarbiedolls or rmakeup of course all genders should be welcome everywhere but they clearly are cant we just be happy and compare this sub with real life where honestly of the females dont care about rocketry either yes the ones you know do because they see how passionate you are about it and it is a basic courtesy to show interest
spacex,not_removed,im sorry that youre upset that no girls want to be in your club but i think its a little arrogant to think it has anything to do with gender bias in engineering lets be honest with ourselves this sub is not some high level representation of the far corners of stem fields its just a sub with an unhealthy borderlinecreepy obsession with elon musk that takes itself way too seriously im pretty sure some of the pictures that get posted here are from the dude in the black acura whos always parked in the field staring if youre reading this black acura dude you arent being stealthy we can all see you complaining about not enough girls hanging out with you in your sub doesnt do much to help that image
spacex,not_removed,more than that youve then got to take into account reddit users who follow the sub regularly and submitted to the survey
spacex,not_removed,whats stopping women from visiting this subreddit
spacex,not_removed,wrong women on average are significantly less interested in stem not because social pressure but because women are not the same as men its not that strange if you look at them they look different they think different they like different things
spacex,not_removed,but still the only major social media site to not be majority female
spacex,not_removed,i dont understand that says the audience concluded that of reddit users were female thats nearly half of all users
spacex,not_removed,i meant it more as a cultural accusation there is a reason girls go less in the stem fields and its not cuz theyre not masculine its cause the culture we grew up with encourages them to go be pop singers or whatever this inherently causes this subreddit to feel like a boy club and yeah maybe that not caring about fate of humanity was a bit too far on my end its just a frustration i have because people care more about what the kardashians are wearing rather than what spacex is doing
spacex,not_removed,thanks for posting that as a member of your age cohort i watched alan shepard live i would have said almost exactly the same things except ive nothing against google as a company and use google and google related sites all the time search of course youtube translate occasionally maps and is there any browser other than chrome worth using but i am not aware of any substantial benefit the one that won me over was that if i have a google account i can sign into chrome running on anyone elses machine and have it become my chrome with all my bookmarks history c makes borrowing someone elses boxpadphone to do some web browsing sooooooooooo much easier
spacex,not_removed,next year well tighten up our bounding a little more i see your point but to some extent it might be better not to so that we can pick out the random guesses much more easily if we so wished
spacex,not_removed,thanks so much
spacex,not_removed,im not sure if youre being serious seems like you put two different numbers together the format is
spacex,not_removed,why are women better than men at stem
spacex,not_removed,i find that strange i would imagine that reddit would appeal more to the gen techies
spacex,not_removed,im one of the old farts who watched the moon landing live mdash hell i dragged my grans bw portable teevee to the grade school in my little red wagon so we could all watch one of the mercury launches gordo cooper i think despite some other classroom having already reserved the one tv the school av dept had for that day myspace no sorry still wrong age group i was using the internet before the web existed never had an aol account a geocities page a myspace page a facebook account or anything similar which is not to say im some asocial luddite i spend way more time on various social media than is probably good for me i mostly post and sometimes host or moderate on private or semiprivate conferencing sites that center around particular interests affinities and work groups and i read a lot of twitter i do have a twitter account but i never use it i read but dont tweet or follow and this is the first subreddit i ever saw that seemed worth my time this is in fact an an astonishingly wellmoderated wellinformed wellbehaved group of people and i salute you all moderators and redditors alike for maintaining one of the highestquality online spaces ive ever had the privilege to inhabit
spacex,not_removed,this is correct was the second time
spacex,not_removed,oo i see what you mean you are correct
spacex,not_removed,what about us people of luxembourg
spacex,not_removed,perhaps but new zealand also has a space industry of one launcher to be fair but we are still very interested in spacex could it be that new space companies in general are seen as a challenger to arianespace which is definitely in the old space camp genuine interest in your answer
spacex,not_removed,oh i know i see where the confusion comes from with ´you´ i ment in general it´s not shown in the media my apologies
spacex,not_removed,at my school stem majors are about girls iirc but for the school as a whole its closer to and this is pretty good by the standards of schools around here the gap opens even wider for actual graduates and those going to higher degrees its a big problem
spacex,not_removed,its very much a thing in france too
spacex,not_removed,cant speak for other countries but it is definitely a common attitude over here in the uk too
spacex,not_removed,i am it is not a boys club as in no women allowed it is a boys club in the sense that there are few women
spacex,not_removed,why do you ask
spacex,not_removed,persistent image of engineering as a boys club are you an engineer its unclear why youre asking but just in case this is not an attack on engineers this kind of perception can come from all kinds of sources
spacex,not_removed,of course anyone can be one but when youre dealing with large groups of people small differences in society tend to produce big results over time there are obviously forces at work that are tending to push women away from certain careers if youre going to state that something is a fact you should back it up
spacex,not_removed,its generally accepted and i think supported by research that removing gender bias will lead to better outcomes women are not being excluded from stem fields because of a lack of ability all that gender bias does is remove up to half of your potential talent base from being able to contribute
spacex,not_removed,saying it needs to change means saying that we hope it can change in the future its not saying to hire less qualified candidates to force an immediate change for example at a company like spacex treating a symptom isnt a good or fair solution you need to treat the cause its about growing outreach and ultimately changing the image of stem over the long run so that you dont discourage girls with great talent from going on to pursue interests in stem fields specifically rocketry otherwise you cut your potential talent pool in half
spacex,not_removed,one simple reason spaceflight needs all the support it can get if of the population dont want anything to do with the spaceflight industry that is a massive pr problem no matter what your opinions on gender equality and affirmative action
spacex,not_removed,there are plenty of traditionally feminine fields like fashion hairdressing or cooking yet when you look at the top people in the world doing those jobs they are still pretty male dominated so theres definitely something more than just a case of the best people rising to the top
spacex,not_removed,just a sub with an unhealthy borderlinecreepy obsession with elon musk that takes itself way too seriously i think you just confused rspacex with the glorious rspacexmasterrace p
spacex,not_removed,apparently something is since of the population are female and out of those who end up here only are
spacex,not_removed,yep exactly
spacex,not_removed,thats fine your first comment just came off a little harsh its definitely a major issue online and it makes me doubly curious to see what spacexs own gender breakdown in the workforce looks like
spacex,not_removed,i think youre making the mistake of assuming that women dont tend to go into stem as much as men because theyre more interested in the kardashian stuff in reality i think many many more women are interested in stem fields than actually end up going into them because of a steady drip of influences making them feel unwelcome pushed out
spacex,not_removed,oops sorry small screen didnt help
spacex,not_removed,wow thats really cool hopefully youll see the first person in mars too but im doubtful itll even come in my lifetime
spacex,not_removed,the recovery of that video still blows my mind
spacex,not_removed,wait theres more than
spacex,not_removed,honestly no idea people from the space industry often talk about spacex usually but not always to complain but i dont really know how random french space enthusiasts see it which i suppose constitute the majority of this subreddit even if its a pure guess btw i think a question asking whether people are working in the space industry or not would be interesting for the survey
spacex,not_removed,i just think maybe they dont like stem and dont pick this major completely by their choice
spacex,not_removed,canada too
spacex,not_removed,i think it implies the former rather than the latter but maybe that wasnt the intention
spacex,not_removed,because the answer has to be taken with a grain of salt if youre not i never felt like engineering is a boys club but have seen this assertion mostly from people in other fields almost in a mocking way if anything most engineers i know got into the field despite the low percentage of women because they were interested in the subject most women also have a rather mocking view of stem fields and it can be quite frustrating trying to talk about anything remotely technical with them many people also assume we are all a bunch of nerds that dont know how to talk to people and especially women which is imho not true
spacex,not_removed,like women as a whole not liking or finding those careers rewardinginteresting
spacex,not_removed,havent seen any researches supporting this however ive seen a study which claimed that most companies didnt gain much from introducing a womens quota no i didnt saved it or have a link but id be interested in supporting the claim you have mentioned i think quotas are dumb removing bias itself is a good thing and needs to happen in first grade
spacex,not_removed,i think you are looking for a problem where there is none
spacex,not_removed,lets say women are as likely as men to be part of reddit as likely to be engineers as likely to be part of startups and as likely to fill out the survey compared to men that gives you female representation sure the numbers are made up and many things are unaccounted for however there doesnt need to be any sexism in this subreddit to get a female representation in the survey
spacex,not_removed,oh i got confused i thought you were trying to disprove that female participation was high but its pretty sad to see such a staggeringly low interest in rocketry from female redditors especially when they compose half of the entire reddit userbase
spacex,not_removed,can you tell why this should matter spacex could be women and then then they would relaunch a rocket next week yeah okay does their gender make it a more important achievement the outcome is all what matters i just dont get the we need to have more girls no we need more talented and well educated people
spacex,not_removed,the cause for less girls in stem is debatable i personally dont think its because stem makes them feel unwelcome but i have no evidence to disprove that either so i guess ill concede on the matter i really do hope that more girls start taking up science oriented careers it is certainly a field that would benefit from female minded presence just like literature has
spacex,not_removed,i dont have any statistics either but i wouldnt be surprised if women in stem did outperform men since roughly speaking due to existing biases they have to be better to have a chance of getting hired so a they have to work harder and b the better than average ones get through i dont think women in general are actually better in stem field its just a result of higher requirements and as to why so few women seem to be interested my interests were always about the stereotypical male interests so it wasnt ever an issue for me because physics coding etc are the kind of things that really interest me and i wouldnt consider studying something else instead but i can totally see how if you have several different interests youd want to go for the one where there isnt as much discrimination based on gender because that can be exhausting depending on where exactly you are similarly dominantly male spaces can often be not super welcoming of women although luckily this subreddit is an exception but it can also make it harder just to get into certain things in your free time too pretty sure in a world without stereotypes and biases the gender distribution here would not be as one sided the inherent differences between genders are by far not as big as many might think
spacex,not_removed,youd need an awful lot of parallel universes to explain that ours comes out with a number as skewed as that that such a big share of women chooses to not go into engineering purely by random chance this also kinda misses the core question which is why would it be desirable to have this field of study be dominated by one gender rather than gender not being recognizable as differentiating factor
spacex,not_removed,and australia
spacex,not_removed,i dont like giving away personal information but ill just say i work in a related field and work closely with engineers besides the boys club image is not my own creation so its irrelevant its based more on empirical evidence that show low female participation and countless studies showing low female participation in various stem careers most women also have a rather mocking view of stem fields generalisation no maybe youre socialising with the wrong women
spacex,not_removed,claiming that all women dont like something is textbook sexism why cant you bring yourself to imagine admit that women are just people and just as likely to find engineering interesting as men and that therefore there must be other factors at play
spacex,not_removed,like women as a whole not liking or finding those careers rewardinginteresting the core question is this why would it be desirable to have this field of study be dominated by one gender rather than gender not being recognizable as differentiating factor
spacex,not_removed,wondering if youd be able to think about the following questions and share your thoughts with the sub if you want to why do women not find these careers interesting or rewarding do you think any of these reasons are problems
spacex,not_removed,i dont think quotas are a good idea either and its horrible to think that some companies would be forced to hire women just because theyre women and need to make the quota i believe the point that was trying to be made is that for whatever reason whether its social conditioning antiwomen prejudice at the education level for stem or just simply less women are interested or literally any reason you can think of there are significantly fewer women in stem fields than you would expect this means that you could question if there are many women who would be technically capable of being one of the best people however for whatever reason they simply are not in the right field
spacex,not_removed,lets think about this a little reddit is free to browse and find the subs you are interested in could it be that females arent interested in one very specific rocket company
spacex,not_removed,the flaw in your logic is that you dont see the connection between we need to have more girls on the one hand and we need more talented and well educated people on the other if the goal is to find the best of the best you are necessarily losing out on talent when you draw from only half of the potential applicant pool
spacex,not_removed,if there is a gender bias in the selection process or the education process then you are not getting the most talent you could in your employment thats why its important to take into consideration
spacex,not_removed,yep there is much room for debate and research into this topic i can tell you from personal experiences that i have mentored more than a few youngsters male and female in stem there is a fair amount of attrition in both groups because of the long hours and other difficulties i would say that more of the ladies leave to start families in my experience than the boys they usually leave because they just cant hack it i can say that in my current working group there is one lady compared to men but since my group is made up of highly experienced folks think years and probably years on average within our corporation the male to female ratio is probably skewed by legacy issues and is definitely not representative of the current base we would draw from inn the future
spacex,not_removed,well thats covered a good chunk of the western world with the exception of germany the acclaimed home of the highquality engineer p it has to be said that the german and austrian engineering companies ive visited have a much better malefemale ratio though
spacex,not_removed,yes the thing is though there is low female participation and thats a shame and everyone i know agrees there is nothing holding women back from pursuing a stem career on the contrary at least in my country i mean you cant make them
spacex,not_removed,i didnt claim all i said on the whole you are looking for a problem where there is none
spacex,not_removed,many women choose to put a priority on family over their careers this is not a problem women not choosing to go into stem fields isnt an issue at the company level it is at the education level they are choosing to not go into the field at academic level
spacex,not_removed,i guess we mostly agree but im not able to discuss on a deeper or more well articulated form english isnt my first language and i have a hard time discussingarguing
spacex,not_removed,yes exactly women are not interested in spacex or at least rspacex at all my question is why why arent they interested in spacex at all
spacex,not_removed,if we have people applying for a job and find the perfect fit lets say its a guy and its unlikely you find someone​ better would you let another women apply just to have more women makes no sense i wouldnt make a difference between these applying people or would you men and women applying for a position and if one side isnt even make it even
spacex,not_removed,there is nothing holding women back from pursuing a stem career well clearly something is holding them back because such a lopsided gender distribution doesnt just happen by random chance to preempt any and all confusion though this does not necessarily need to have anything at all to do with the people in the field or the people teaching it or anything of the sort it would be a shame if this was perceived as an attack on engineers when you yourself can recognize that lopsided population is not optimal most women also have a rather mocking view of stem fields and it can be quite frustrating trying to talk about anything remotely technical with them many people also assume we are all a bunch of nerds that dont know how to talk to people and especially women which is imho not true these for example would still be problems potentially factors holding women back from enrolling in these fields so regardless of what the cause is we should do more to erode whatever barriers are in place that are causing this divide unless science finds out that women would somehow be biologically held back from excelling in it which doesnt seem to be the case
spacex,not_removed,yes the thing is though there is low female participation and thats a shame and everyone i know agrees there is nothing holding women back from pursuing a stem career i agree with the first bit and disagree with the second bit anyway im a bit bored of discussing this for the last few days so maybe we can just agree to disagree peace
spacex,not_removed,i interpret women as a whole as being pretty clearly the same as all women
spacex,not_removed,thanks for your reply personally i think the idea that women choose to sacrifice careers to prioritize family is a gender bias it does not explain poor representation in engineering there are many professions where it isnt the case i agree that there is an issue attracting women to study engineering in particular in australia for example uni engineering degrees attract around female students compared to around for sciences however studies have also shown that many of these do not go on to careers because of problems later including overt sexism in established companies and im enjoying the downvotes guys for those claiming theres no problem in this sub just trying to have a respectful discussion
spacex,not_removed,it is a complex issue i am not arguing for quotas however more needs to be done at all levels not just at school
spacex,not_removed,the scenario is more likely to play out like this you have people are women of those dont pursue an engineering degree or face some form of discrimination which leads them to dropping that pursuit this is an effect that we as a society consciously or unconsciously create now of those men also dont outside a stem field but now your hiring pool is people rather than the problem with this bias is that it doesnt just happen in the job interview women are pushed away from stem fields for their whole lives and this is what costs you that of talent hiring quotas are a reaction to this and a attempt to change these embedded stigmas to enable a more capable workforce
spacex,not_removed,interpret there is the problem then
spacex,not_removed,thats for sure
spacex,not_removed,i categorically disagree with you your statements above show blatant sexism you seriously think that women are so fundamentally different from men that some physical trait of theirs makes them less interested in engineering than men think about what youre saying the same arguments have been used in the past to push women out of work altogether out of being able to vote out of being able to choose their own partners etc etc to overcome sexism you have to first realise that women are just people theyre not a different species if they have a tiny representation in certain fields its because theres a problem with the field not with women
spacex,not_removed,i categorically disagree with you too women can go into whatever the field of work they want and there in lies the problem when given the choice women gravitate towards careers which interest them as do men men tend choose jobs over family women tend to choose family over careers if you can do the job and want to do the job who gives a fuck what gender you are it doesnt matter at all the issue here is choice if of women chose to not go into stem fields because they werent interested you would still be beating this horse calling people sexist like youve just done is also a surefire way of shutting down logical and thought out discussion shame on you
spacex,not_removed,i guess the multiple sonic booms will be raised as the main issue i do hope all goes well for spacex as i for one am so looking forward to seeing falcon heavy take of and land hopefully this year go spacex
spacex,not_removed,why does spacex need approval to build new landing pads i understand getting approval to use them but if they ownlease the land shouldnt they be able to build what they want
spacex,not_removed,yes definitely but i think echo said that the launch has been moved again to
spacex,not_removed,this is florida we are used to lightning storms and such and a sonic boom every month or so isnt going to hurt anybody
spacex,not_removed,pretty much has the right idea any type of work needs to be permitted regardless of land ownership for any work or finished product that impacts the shared environment those permits will be tied to certain conditions in such cases the parties involved must post notice of the type of work to be done and the end use of the project and then allow for public comments that are to be considered by the permitting agencies i mainly deal with stormwater runoff and have seen this process play out before theres a similar process when one of our clients the dot wants to widen a road the dot may own all the land it wishes to build upon but the construction itself will have an impact on water resources wildlife local traffic patterns access to businesses and homes and increased noise during construction and from greater traffic capacity same would go for a private developer wanting to construct homes on a large tract of farmland they just purchased sometimes the locals come up with a concern that you didnt anticipate which requires further investigation the pads spacex plans to build are in a secure area of a military installation and far from any locals and they may already have their mitigation strategies designed to account for any wetland damage or wildlife impact but the end use of these pads will be the landing of rocket stages that create sonic booms heard and felt miles away that is considered an environmental impact to the shared environment in much the same way that an airport wanting to add a new runway and landing approach that puts plane noise over houses that did not have it before therefore the rules state that public input must be solicited and considered against the net benefit provided by the project personally i grew up in the space shuttle era and missed the booms when they stopped flying its great to have them back and to me they are the sound of progress toward the future and the sound of an industry returning to the local economy but i can see the concern of those booms rocking your windows monthly or more often if the launch cadence is to be believed at all hours of the day for comparison the shuttle program the only other thing in the area to have that amount of boom rarely had more than landings in any given year peak was i believe so the public has the ability to comment and those comments will be rightly taken into account prior to permit approval
spacex,not_removed,this is speculation but i imagine its similar to the reasons you cant just go pour concrete for a pool in your backyard all willy nilly there are permits and approvals in place to make sure its done safely and doesnt screw anything up for anyone else
spacex,not_removed,one of the pads will be built in an area currently designated as a watercourse and so will need environmental approvals
spacex,not_removed,where did you read this
spacex,not_removed,can you please provide a link to that source im trying to figure out where the pads would be located theres a rectangular water basin to east of is that what youre referring to
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,mostly it is from the announcement in the paper which lists that the reason for the environmental approval being that part of the development is on a floodplain i dont recall if further info comes from comments here which are hard to search or irc slack discussions
spacex,not_removed,thank you
spacex,not_removed,official youtube video
spacex,not_removed,im curious if someone can explain why the smoke from this test looks different than other tests ive seen seems more black than normal
spacex,not_removed,awesome all our complaining finally got us a fulllength video of something other than a launch webcast d
spacex,not_removed,does anyone else hear that bird freaking the fuck out about in
spacex,not_removed,wow that was a long burn i had to check to see if the video had started looping also on a test stand i havent seen before this is the booster they are testing to end of lifespan right edit just read the article on the front page doesnt look like itll fly again
spacex,not_removed,to the mods this is official from spacex facebook page thank you
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if they are using all of the original engines do we know if any of them were replaced
spacex,not_removed,can anyone explain to me why the smoke starts out white and ends up turning black is it because the fuel mixes differently depending on how far into the burn by pure speculation id assume its blacker because its being mixed with more lox since t doesnt need as much in the lower atmosphere whereas in the upper atmosphere there isnt as much air to mix with and use as an oxidizer is this correctpartially
spacex,not_removed,thank you for the full length youtube video spacex
spacex,not_removed,youtube official
spacex,not_removed,another important milestone towards reusability passed and with flying colors ps this might be one of the reasons for getting delayed for a week or so the booster is next to take the stand
spacex,not_removed,does anyone know how fueling works for these full duration test fires during launches we see umbilicals providing fuel until a minute before liftoff we also know from past launches that the densified propellants cant be stored in the stage for too long without heating up
spacex,not_removed,burn baby burn
spacex,not_removed,hmm is it just me or does the smoke look sootier than normal incomplete combustion
spacex,not_removed,amazing success amazing video to watch i cant help but wonder what role the additional effects of gforces and dynamic forces of flight will have on a reused booster im sure the vibrational effects due to engine firing are suitably present if not increased from being fired so close to the ground naturally gforces and dynamic forces of flight cannot be simulated in a static fire test and neither if i may add the wear and tear caused by them during launch and landing not to mention repeated propellant loadings and thermal cycling of testing launching landing and repeat spacex is gathering data on all of these at a rapid pace and constantly improving and without a doubt in my mind will master it but it will take time and there will be many many painful bumps along the road each teaching us something new before we can earn the mastery of reusable rocket flight im all strapped in to my armchair for the ride to cheer them on every step of the way
spacex,not_removed,is this the first weve seen of this test stand
spacex,not_removed,anyone know any specifics as to what they had to refurbishreplace obviously the time to reuse is going to become shorter and shorter as they improve but do we have enough information now to make an educated guess
spacex,not_removed,i took me a second to process what i was watching absolutely ground breaking stuff new data never collected before being generated by the nanosecond so happy to be able to watch this
spacex,not_removed,this is a smooth and consistent burn to my layperson eyes and ears coupled with the fact that spacex published it i would say that this is a successful test impressive for a gto booster bodes well for upcoming reuse looking forward to a official confirmationclarification of recent rumours
spacex,not_removed,i think we should seriously start to call this core life leader

spacex,not_removed,and the infestation of bed bugs continued really lets you visualize the pure power of that thing what with such huge clouds of smoke and vapor being sucked in and disappearing is fractions of a second
spacex,not_removed,i love the full length video so awesome
spacex,not_removed,its interesting that the top of the rocket had a yellow cap but in this video it comes across as red also im not sure why the smoke was black for an extended period
spacex,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment official youtube video yeah that is a big question but we havent got any daytime footage of tests on this stand to compare with could be normal could be that they ran this test rich for some reason here is a single engine test fire smoke is fairly dark and they someone in the youtube comments maybe a bird watcher recognized the bird call a killdeer i found a sample im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
spacex,not_removed,how loud is something like this is it comparable to anything normal people have come across before ive seen an antares launch live from miles and it was loud but not redic
spacex,not_removed,looks healthy enough another goal is closer and closer
spacex,not_removed,i wonder how much refurbchecking was done to the vehicle
spacex,not_removed,ok but what engines where changed from the original stage i mean if they changed the entire engine set this is not much impressive but if the engines are the original ones
spacex,not_removed,so wonderful to finally have uncut footage of nonlivestreamed activities
spacex,not_removed,oh lord the youtube comments on this are already atrocious how do some of these people have such negative views on everything
spacex,not_removed,wish had linked this instead facebook links never work their website is so utterly broken
spacex,not_removed,yeah that is a big question but we havent got any daytime footage of tests on this stand to compare with could be normal could be that they ran this test rich for some reason smoke is fairly dark and they could be injecting a lot more cooling water per unit exhaust but different rocket on different stand theres too much difference to make a straight comparison but thats at night so we cant make color comparisons
spacex,not_removed,im wondering about this as well seems like they didnt use the water sound suppression system this time since the white vapour we usually see is steam
spacex,not_removed,it is a simulated full burn could it be simulated fuel mixture for actual altitudes
spacex,not_removed,looks like just a shadow on the steam from the trench andor itself
spacex,not_removed,the simplest explanation would be that they used less water for sound suppression and flame trench cooling than usual possibly to conserve water
spacex,not_removed,my guess is exploring failure modes ie glassingcoking in gas gen pumps injectors they may also be running rich to run cooler and reduce premature oxygen induced failure of test article d
spacex,not_removed,seriously my jaw just kept getting lower and lower as the burn kept going full duration test burn is a heart pounder
spacex,not_removed,i had to check to make sure it wast looping lol
spacex,not_removed,someone in the youtube comments maybe a bird watcher recognized the bird call a killdeer i found a sample
spacex,not_removed,thats all i could think about that bird is most definitely deaf now
spacex,not_removed,yes poor bird
spacex,not_removed,i was hoping to see the wasp fly in front of the camera like it usually does
spacex,not_removed,yes it is this is the most beatup core they have with the possible exception of the thaicom core the test stand is their new falcon first stage test stand their old one would have been too difficult to retrofit for densified propellants plus it was much louder than the new one
spacex,not_removed,this newer stand was first shown in the static fire of the orbcomm booster
spacex,not_removed,why was the burn so long the normal launch burns are only like seconds right
spacex,not_removed,you could delete it and repost it put official in the title it will probably reach more people eh who cares it will get to the top this video is freaking awesome
spacex,not_removed,i wouldnt think so that would defeat the purpose of testing the stage as the fleet leader
spacex,not_removed,white smoke water vapor from the sound suppression system
spacex,not_removed,i think it has something to do with whats in the trench rather than whats coming out of the engine the white smoke is steam
spacex,not_removed,my best guess would be that the white smoke you see is actually steam from water dumped in the flame trench once all of this water boils off you mostly see the black smoke from the engines with some steam from water still being dumped into the trench but flashing to steam immediately
spacex,not_removed,black smoke is actually the result of incomplete combustion creating a variety of carbon compounds soot that havent found enough oxygen atoms to burn away to so its black due to running rich or fuelrich to distinguish from loxrich its a nice idea about the ambient oxygen changing as the rocket ascends but that doesnt make a difference in a rocket engine the thrust depends on the combustion before the exhaust leaves the nozzle so atmospheric oxygen is irrelevant however check out the sabre engine its a hybrid jetrocket engine under development that does use atmospheric oxygen on the way up before switching to lox itll be interesting to see if its ever costcompetitive
spacex,not_removed,i think its from the trench starting to decay away if its from the engines i dont think its supposed to be that color
spacex,not_removed,may as well delete this since uzlsa is higher up with the same link but shorter
spacex,not_removed,and with flying colors maybe
spacex,not_removed,you may want to
spacex,not_removed,they rocket is clamped down during all launches the engines fire up and the flight computer runs diagnostics on all systems during the first few seconds and aborts if necessary which weve seen several times then the rocket is let go the forces are really great but its not a big engineering hurdle to design some clamps to keep it down really
spacex,not_removed,since the photo in the other thread was taken i dont think so either they only cleaned one side or it is white because of ice build up my guess is the latter
spacex,not_removed,at least that side of it
spacex,not_removed,the umbilicals you see hanging off of the te during a launch are filling up and topping off the tanks in the second stage until for the fullduration test fires and the launches themselves the first stage is filled with fuel by its umbilicals on the bottom of the stage and is topped off until liftoff or in this case i believe seconds after the engines start up you dont see any umbilicals hanging anywhere because there is no te or stage for them to attach to in picture of the falcon octaweb core you can see a bump protruding from the side of the rocket to the left of the octaweb that is the umbilical attachment point for the first stage with its cover up edit words and grammar
spacex,not_removed,if i remember correctly the umbilicals are only for the second stage tanks the first stage fuel inlets are located a lot further down close to the engines so we dont usually get a good look at them during launches
spacex,not_removed,i dont think topping off is even required for these tests since there is usually a fair bit of extra fuel stored in the first stage at meco which they use to land the first stage they dont need to squeeze every last drop in to carry out a fullduration burn of the first stage furthermore i would believe that with the use of superchilled densified fuel and oxidizer by spacex fuel or oxygen loading is actually completed in the last minute which would further reduce the work of umbilicals required to topoff fuel lost to boiloff as a rocket sits on the fuel pad of course umbilicals remain critical for actual mission flight since every last drop of fuel counts there but really not so much for a static fire or even a fullduration simulated burn
spacex,not_removed,i believe it goes in from below for the stage and from the te strongback tower for the stage
spacex,not_removed,we have no idea what made the smoke look dark incomplete combustion that severe should have aborted the test more likely soot ablation
spacex,not_removed,well that thing on top simulates max q probably
spacex,not_removed,i think this is the single most significant thing from this video look at whats being tested obviously the engines fuel and tank systems the control systems for the engines are also getting proved for reuse workout because of the thrust and noise we can assume anything thats vibration suspectable is being proven again ie limited by vibration in design and im thinking pcbs for example the biggest thing for me in this scenario is the structure seems to be under test to the extent that you can simulate gforces and aero maxq they seem to be doing so i look at the pink load as simulating at a minimum the payload mass stage dragon satellite and therefore of loading almost certainly the tensile elements wires or straps holding it down are also adding load the question is how much and is it beyond the restraint needed merely for lateral stability which is why i doubt the pink mass simulates maxq alone at the ultimate level of sophistication its not hard to design a hydraulic system to simulate the loading arriving from maxq and maxacceleration such a system could simulate much of the structural stress cycle ive looked hard at the holddown area of the rocket to see if such a system is evident and i cant be sure neither can i see anything to help me size the four main hold down straps except to say in comparison to the crane they may well be capable of producing maxq loads
spacex,not_removed,negative example
spacex,not_removed,theres a whole industry that would really really like the answer to your question if musks comments so far are to be believed the needed refurbishment is superficial but we really dont know yet for example we have no idea if the legs and grid fins can be reused refurbished or need to be replaced
spacex,not_removed,the way the clouds flash in and out of view reminds me of condensation from over pressure shock in big explosions there must be some serious energy moving through that exhaust plume
spacex,not_removed,im pretty sure thats orange
spacex,not_removed,looks like primer red steel beams are often painted in this for construction and either installed as is or given a proper paint coating after
spacex,not_removed,its loud enough that payloads the launch pad and the rocket itself need to be protected from the vibration with a waterbased sound suppression system and a flame trench which deflects most of the energy to the side its so loud that the acoustical energy alone could kill you if you were to stand close to the running engines
spacex,not_removed,i highly doubt they changed the engines the engines were designed and have been tested for a large number of flights in some ways i think it is the other parts of the booster that need more testing and attention spacex has a lot of confidence in the engines
spacex,not_removed,between electric cars and solar power installations i think elon has balanced out the impact his rockets make
spacex,not_removed,our prayers have been answered
spacex,not_removed,there was one golden comment among the salty ones near the bottom we get it you vape that had me laughing
spacex,not_removed,i dont see any negative comments they must have been pushed to the bottom already
spacex,not_removed,those with negative opinions are also more likely to actually comment the rest of us that actually enjoy the video just watch in awe and than move on to something else
spacex,not_removed,most of them are about how these rockets pump out loads of pollution but do they really i have no idea if they do or not and i never really thought about it before but do you happen to know how much pollution to the air this test would have caused im guessing its not as bad as theyre making it out to be though
spacex,not_removed,spacex hadnt uploaded it to youtube until about minutes after facebook
spacex,not_removed,sorry i checked their twitter and youtube page when it was uploaded to their fb page and didnt see it there so i uploaded the facebook version
spacex,not_removed,upvpplayerpro posted further down it seems to fit the bill the smoke definitely looks more white but this is only the start of the burn and this new burn also had more steam at first so its still hard to tell
spacex,not_removed,exploring failure modes if such is the case i would move any expensive equipment well away from the stand way to much stuff to turn into projectiles next to this strand
spacex,not_removed,it gave me the same rush as the worlds best roller coaster ride i feel high with enkephalins running rampant in my blood wooooh
spacex,not_removed,i instantly recognized it we have those here they make their nests on the ground and when you walk near they go running off pretending to limp and making that call to draw predators away
spacex,not_removed,ah im sure its temporary if we could hear the bird over the rocket it means that microphone was pretty darn far away from the site plus that bird wasnt screeching it was singing a bird song warning of danger a bird going deaf doesnt sing from a perch it screeches and tries to fly away
spacex,not_removed,the wasp and its cousins have a
spacex,not_removed,i remember reading somewhere about how loud the old stand was supposedly they didnt build that one but i might be thinking of another stand glad to see they got an upgraded one
spacex,not_removed,im pretty sure first stage is fine its the leg thats messed up
spacex,not_removed,thanks i cant believe i missed it are there any other videos of them using it
spacex,not_removed,im not sure how long the launch burn is but this one would be longer if they were doing a full duration burn which includes the boost back and landing burns as well
spacex,not_removed,no this burn was the same length as first stage burns on actual launches you can see this by either watching a recording of a previous launch or by checking out one of the mission press kits that give a rundown on event times eg on the second page of the httpwwwspacexcomsitesspacexfilesspacexjcsatpresskitfinalpdf stage shutdownmeco
spacex,not_removed,well what if oneor multiple engines were clearly in bad shape and definitely wouldnt survive an engine firing im not saying thats likely but its definitely possible we know they pulled some of the engines out back at the cape so i imagine its also possible that some individual engine tests were done which could also result in an original engine being lost would they just not test the rest of the stage because of a bad engine or two that doesnt seem likely theyd probably put another engine in there and still test the rest of the stage
spacex,not_removed,ah thanks sometimes im just a moron haha
spacex,not_removed,that actually makes a lot of sense is engineered to burn loxrich at the higher altitudes do you knowmaybe a spx secret p the sabre engine is pretty interesting might have to do some more research on it thanks i enjoy feeling smarter
spacex,not_removed,the trench is not that old
spacex,not_removed,i think they add water to the flame to get it under control for the trench that converts the long burning tail youd see at a launch into a lot of black smoke just my speculation maybe if they added more water they could get rid of the smoke too but on the other hand theres a drought right
spacex,not_removed,i always assumed rocket exhaust was jet black the smoke cloud during launch is mostly steam from the water deluge system and the dispersed exhaust trail from a flying rocket always has a black hue the static fire cloud seems particularly black because the water deluge system exhausts itself after a little while and the exhaust smoke just collects in one place to make a dark cloud smoke is always black it seems blacker when enough of it collects in one place we cannot really perceive if there are more soot particulates emitted per volumetric unit of fueloxidizer flow aka darker exhaustfuel rich exhaust or just more smoke collecting in one place like some others mention above similar comparisons to other full duration static fires are hard to make because they were done in the dark where the smoke will just reflect light and appear white less than fullduration test fires will seem whiter because thats just the steam from the water deluge system still being expended just my two cents but interesting concern nonetheless
spacex,not_removed,zlsas link was to a differentunofficial upload at the time ubattlerushgaming posted
spacex,not_removed,typically if the plethora of sensors built into every nook and cranny of the booster detect any anomaly it aborts the burn the fact it kept burning for the full simulated first stage flight profile is a very positive sign that too from the most beat up booster we have im very optimistic
spacex,not_removed,black is a color
spacex,not_removed,this would be the case at the beginning of the burn but after using of fuel it will still be producing the same thrust perhaps thats why they have the cables holding it down too
spacex,not_removed,there are two connections arranged degrees apart
spacex,not_removed,incomplete combustion that severe should have aborted the test i figured as much but couldnt think of any other reasons
spacex,not_removed,wheres the source on that i remember seeing that in an imgur album alongside separation test and something else
spacex,not_removed,definitely looked like primer red to me as well
spacex,not_removed,my point was more how the different visual recording equipment caught the same object in the same lighting ie at the same moment yet appeared to be quite different colors
spacex,not_removed,it would be an awful death too as they pass through your body the vibrations from the sound would rupture all of your internal organs oo
spacex,not_removed,now i want to see someone using a vape pen that looks like a falcon see its reusable
spacex,not_removed,i rather enjoyed aaaaaaand now texas is in orbit
spacex,not_removed,i guess what they say is true the haters show up first and loud then everyone else drowns them out with more positive comments
spacex,not_removed,the rest of us that actually enjoy the video just watch in awe and than move on to something else yeah commenting on reddit
spacex,not_removed,well what are they burning liquid oxygen and something else right im sure there is some amount of pollution sure but not like we are going to stop launching rockets any time soon compared to the output of a coal plant or a super tanker ship i think its pretty negligible that being said its best to not read any youtube comments ever
spacex,not_removed,dont get me started on the green weenies all human activities even so called eco ones have impacts on the environment solar panels require a factory giant open pit mines etc etc the number of rocket firing globally is quite small one rocket launch puts out about the same outputs as a single flight from la to asia there are literally over flights per day so rockets are well under of the outputs of the airline industry
spacex,not_removed,nice find theres more white condensing steam from the sound suppression in that video but the smoke itself seems similarly black
spacex,not_removed,once the green teateb flash happens thats like going over the crest of the roller coaster its about to get real
spacex,not_removed,nope i believe that was built by beal aerospace the company spacex bought the test site from
spacex,not_removed,no that was the only video with detail there may be some amateur faraway videosimages but not much
spacex,not_removed,im not sure we know if they pulled out engines from but youre right that it wouldnt make sense to just not fire the stage if it had faulty engines but maybe they could just fire without all the engines it worked for dev
spacex,not_removed,not at all its not as obvious that the test stands have a water deluge system because unlike the launch pads they are hidden from sight
spacex,not_removed,kudos to ugoscienceeverything who gave a couple of really good answers i just wanted to add that engines also run fuelrich because it increases the efficiency of the engines due to there being more hydrogen in the exhaust just like the reason you ended up with the mailmans blue eyes instead of your fathers brown ones its complicatedbut when it comes to first stage engines efficiency comes second only to thrust to weight ratio in importance
spacex,not_removed,no engine to my knowledge runs loxrich in the main combustion chamber because the superhot oxygen is extremely corrosive to metals there is always at least a slight excess of fuel to protect the chamber there is some variation of how fuelrich they run but i dont know where the marlins place there or if they change the mixing ratio during ascent russian engines like the and others run oxygenrich in their turbopumps which avoids buildup of soot in the mechanism and probably has other advantages i dont know of this is enabled by some advanced metallurgy that others have not been able to succeed at ula in fact bought the blueprints to the engines and the right to build them but wasnt able to figure out the manufacturing techniques necessary to actually make the engine and thus has to keep buying them from russia sometimes people get confused and say the engines run loxrich but its only the turbopumps regarding sabre the idea is pretty awesome but many wellinformed people are skeptical about the practicality and costeffectiveness but itll be interesting to watch and dont count on it but maybe theyll prove the skeptics wrong
spacex,not_removed,depends on the fuel and oxidizer used hydrogen and oxygen combustion results in mostly just water vapor
spacex,not_removed,the launch clamps are designed for one task holding the rocket in place whether the engines are running or not they can handle it
spacex,not_removed,i think the cables holding it down are a safety backup in case things get really hot down at the bottom and the clamps down there lose their strength
spacex,not_removed,thanks for the correction
spacex,not_removed,yeup same album static fire separation testing center pusher seen parachute tests and the nowreleased dragon hover test
spacex,not_removed,it all came from that incorrectly published internal pr video spacex cool stuff
spacex,not_removed,never heard that must have been hater haters who said that
spacex,not_removed,it just bothers me that there are people that will go around spreading the idea that things like rockets are whats ruining the environment but completely ignore how much pollution cars and coal and other fossil fuel plants cause in comparison then theyll go telling that to people they know with many of them just nodding in agreement i guess its not really an issue though as long as they dont become politicians
spacex,not_removed,i dont think it is the green weenies that are the ones making these comments rather i think it is those with the opposite mindset that see musk with his electric car and solar panel companies and want to say see even the green weenie is pumping out pollution they of course wont face up to the fact that as you said rocket launches make up an absolutely minuscule amount of modern pollution
spacex,not_removed,indeed it does look similarly black so one source of soot is the gas generator but that should be constant across all engine runs it was hard to tell in the just how black it is because the camera is too close but you do get a nice shot of the gas generator just pouring out soot to the side of the main nozzle the reason for this is that the gas generator needs to run coolers the turbine cant be regenerative cooled like the combustion chamber walls are and it also has to endure major forces so it cant get too hot so they run it very fuel rich which is dirty are these tests producing more smoke than a launch does its hard to be sure because in a launch the exhaust gets ejected so fast and so far that maybe its just diluted with air there definitely is a trace of blackness on launch however i am inclined to believe this is more a possibility for why is that the sound suppression system extinguishes the exhaust the whitehot flame extending below the rocket should be able to burn off some of the gas generators soot when mixing with the atmosphere whereas on the test stand its cooled immediately at least to subredhot temperatures if the residual combustion hypothesis were true it wouldnt happen in the upper atmosphere but we still dont see smoke up there perhaps because the exhaust scatters so fast in every direction in the nearvacuum
spacex,not_removed,ay thats what i thought thanks for confirming
spacex,not_removed,correct spacex did build the metal flame deflector below the old test stand however
spacex,not_removed,nsf says the engines were all fired individually before the full fire most likely that means they were removed
spacex,not_removed,i think youre right about not knowing if they pulled engines out of this stage now that i think of it im pretty sure i was thinking of that had its engines pulled out at the cape
spacex,not_removed,i just wanted to add that engines also run fuelrich because it increases the efficiency of the engines due to there being more hydrogen in the exhaust that is not true for kerolox engines like the merlin which uses high grade kerosene not hydrogen running fuel rich means there are lots of heavy hydrocarbons left unburnt which are very slow when leaving the combustion chamber as the thrust is directly related to the exhaust velocity having lots of heavy slow molecules in the exhaust hurts efficiency the reason they run fuel rich is to keep the temperature in the combustion chamber down if they ran closer to the ideal ratio the temperatures and pressures in the combustion chamber would be far too high for any reasonable material to withstand
spacex,not_removed,well this is a new idea to me i wonder if you could explain something ive been confused about for awhile i feel like im close to getting it but not really there yet basically whats the deal with exhaust mass here are the foundations i understand for a set combustion temperature lighter molecules fly out of the engine at a higher velocity than heavier molecules isp is directly proportional to exhaust velocity so the higher the exhaust velocity the lighter the molecules the higher your perpropellantmass efficiency is thus lighter exhaust means you get more total push from the same mass of propellant total push total impulse impulse force x time however kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity whereas momentum change is linearly proportional to velocity so for a given amount of energy slowerbutmoremassive reaction mass gives you more push this is the concept behind a turbofan engine rather than pushing the exhaust out super fast use its energy to drive a fan to push literal tons of air through the engine relatively slowly so if im understanding correctly you get opposing effects lighter exhaust will yield more push per unit of propellant mass but less push per unit energy is impulseperunitenergy ever more important than impulseperunitmass in other words is heavier exhaust ever better than lighter exhaust assuming you cant pull in air as reaction mass i think that moreimpulseperunitenergy is related to higher thrust it sounds intuitively right but i cant quite see why it would be so since earlier in the flight high thrust is more important than isp in determining final payload mass does that make heavier exhaust a better thing or simply a moretolerable thing if the reaction that produces the heavier exhaust is just much faster the space shuttle sls solid boosters have aluminum as fuel which is relatively heavy they produce a tremendous amount of thrust and im not clear on whether thats in part because of the heavier exhaust or simply that its so easy to burn huge amounts of the fuel so quickly that that adequately compensates for the heavy exhaust
spacex,not_removed,but wasnt able to figure out the manufacturing techniques necessary to actually make the engine and thus has to keep buying them from russia my understanding was that there was an effort to build an american version of the but politicians scoffed at the cost its not that it was too difficult to figure out
spacex,not_removed,i recognize the face on the weight from stage sep but not sure which video game it is from
spacex,not_removed,kerolox rocket engines are usually run rich it increases the mass of the exhaust increasing thrust which can mean more than the loss of efficiency isp from incomplete combustion this does leave carbon in the exhaust the dark exhaust could be just as you say that the structure of the trench and the water cool the exhaust off during a test whereas the exhaust remains hot and burns off as the bright orange flame during a launch
spacex,not_removed,in any case this is all cool and all but it is slightly painful to see so much soot being spewed out in a notexactlyunpopulated area incompletely combusted fuel are moderately toxicthese rockets greenhouse gas emissions are just a drop in the bucket but if this amount of smoke is typical then their emission of other pollutants is a somewhat larger drop in the bucket
spacex,not_removed,imho you can clearly see soot at high altitude
spacex,not_removed,removed but not replaced i guess pretty good for the condition it came back in
spacex,not_removed,my understanding is that kerosene cant exist at merlin nozzle temps and becomes highly dissociative there by resulting in hydrogen oxygen and carbon being fired out the tail pipe to a large degree after which it becomes co and amorphous carbon soot after its too late to matter to isp could be wrong its just how it was explained to me edit add the to a large degree part because it sounded too absolute
spacex,not_removed,so if im understanding correctly you get opposing effects lighter exhaust will yield more push per unit of propellant mass but less push per unit energy but the unit is not energy its mass flow lighter exhaust generated from the same ton of propellants per second will give you higher exhaust velocity higher isp and higher thrust so theres no tradeoff between thrust and isp there is a tradeoff between thrust and effective isp through another channel because the traditional way to get higher thrust is to build a bigger engine but that bigger engine may require disproportionately more mass and may reduce your twr and thus reduce the effective isp to orbit this is why spacex is optimizing their engines for twr and then are putting several of those engines on the same rocket this is actually more mass efficient than building a larger engine because it keeps the large rocket at the twr sweet spot too theres also probably an aerospike effect as well when using a field of engines which is an added bonus for vacuum efficiency of the booster stage
spacex,not_removed,paging urocket to the courtesy phone as someone who hasnt had a physics class in years i was really hoping some smart person would answer your question but here we are hours later and i have about chance of getting it wrong so take this for what its worth heavy exhaust means you have to lift more heavy reaction mass in the tanks which means youre putting that thrust into more momentum instead of velocity which is the opposite of what you want high tw ratio is more important than just thrust at lift off i hope that helps if i got this one right i get a gold star for the day
spacex,not_removed,hmm didnt know that regardless if its cheaper to buy from the russia company including profit margin than for a us company to make it then clearly theyre doing something better over there it may be that they just have a better method to make the same alloys but thats nothing to sneeze at the manufacturing method can be as important if not more important than the engineering of the product itself for example spacexs significantly reduced price compared to competitors comes not from having a highperforming vehicle but from having innovatively efficient manufacturing and a vehicles whose design is conducive to efficient manufacturing
spacex,not_removed,my understanding is that kerosene cant exist at merlin nozzle temps and becomes highly dissociative there by resulting in hydrogen oxygen and carbon being fired out the tail pipe to a large degree after which it becomes co and amorphous carbon soot after its too late to matter to isp almost the exhaust gas product of the incomplete combustion in the combustion chamber is a mixture of literally every possible atom and molecule that can be combined from the propellants c h o co ho you name it the exact proportion is dependent on many factors but the mixture ratio is typically tuned to push the mixture as much towards light molecules as possible this maximizes exhaust velocity and thus maximizes isp once the hot exhaust leaves the nozzle it will recombine with each other and with the atmosphere if still present and of the lox mass will transform into and
spacex,not_removed,check out page of this presentation increasing the mix ratio ie adding more oxygen would increase efficiency but at the expense of a nastier environment in the combustion chamber which would be hard on the engine
spacex,not_removed,it is more likely that spacex has opted for multiple smaller rocket engines rather than a few larger ones because of combustion instability issues this is the reason why the soviets opted for multiple combustion chambers on one rocket engine as opposed to the more traditional singlelargechamber approach
spacex,not_removed,im almost right im gonna go ahead and count this as a victory this puts me in the upper echelon of armchair rocket scientists i bet we are in short supply at spacex better clean up my resume does incomplete combustion mean that some of the will make it out intact or does it mean that some of the hydrocarbon will not react but will still generally be broken down into elements and smaller molecules in the combustion chamber id assume the latter but would like to actually be right the next time it comes up
spacex,not_removed,check out page of this presentation that presentation has very little substance it lists a couple of accusations and then concludes with more accusations no counter facts or counter arguments offered some gems page lists the merlin engine with a mixture ratio of in reality its on the falcon ft page lists kerosene isp levels of over which only hydrolox engines are able to reach the engines operate so fuel rich they dump eighty percent of the kerosene overboard unused these inefficient rocket engines pollute the atmosphere with thousands of pounds of unused kerosene which is an environmental disaster and the broader argument that higher mixture ratio improves isp is false as well
spacex,not_removed,interesting read but mr jensen suspiciously appears to be in the minority in those findings being but a lowly fan boy im not competent enough to establish who knows what their talking about but one would think with all the brilliant engineers working on rocket engines somebody would have figured this out by now besides him
spacex,not_removed,id assume the latter but would like to actually be right the next time it comes up no can make it out intact the main combustion chamber the thermal decomposition temperature of all hydrocarbons that make up is below most of them well below that temperature so theres very little chance for any long hydrocarbon chain to cross the raging hot hell of a nozzle throat intact even if it never meets any molecule it can react with but theres not enough oxidizer for everything to burn to completion some may get out the turbine exhaust but i doubt it even that is above
spacex,not_removed,it doesnt matter if its going up against the banking system paypal going up against the entire aerospace industry spacex or going up against the us auto industry tesla this sentence is epic though he missed the energy industry solarcity
spacex,not_removed,hopefully not a repost interesting background from jim cantrell
spacex,not_removed,he read a lot of books
spacex,not_removed,i believe it has been posted before but fascinating info nonetheless
spacex,not_removed,the date is listed in the exhibit attachment echostar is scheduled for launch on approximately january i guess this officially ends any talk of two flights by the end of this year
spacex,not_removed,looks like ill lose
spacex,not_removed,were getting some sweet back to back missions lets see how spacex can handle it
spacex,not_removed,do we know the reason could it be that spacex needs a bit more time with
spacex,not_removed,iridium it is then correct
spacex,not_removed,so according to the sidebar theres now missions planned for january if that holds up looks like we might be picking up better than where we left off

spacex,not_removed,no no is it a pad issue hope they will have a launch next month at cali
spacex,not_removed,honestly id be happy with just the one no need to get greedy lol assuming a turnaround time between launches this puts the first launch rtf somewhere around december though if theres holidays it may be a week turnaround time instead putting us somewhere in the december time frame this seems to fall in line with the mid december in the side bar
spacex,not_removed,ill be surprised if we get one they know december is no longer some nebulous amount of time in the future but rather next week right
spacex,not_removed,just adding a
spacex,not_removed,it could be any number of things they might need more time to work the bugs out of they might want cape staff to take a bit of a break they might need workers to finish up vandenbergs pad they might need more time to complete testing at mcgregor suffice to say its totally normal but hard to pin down to one reason
spacex,not_removed,iirc spacexs plan before the mishap was to get ready by the end of after the mishap they tried to speed up the process to get it ready by november so even if this delay is caused by the pad it is still a spaceshedulemiracle the pad is actually ready to launch in january imagine boca chica having only one month of delay d
spacex,not_removed,yep hopefully they can get that off before the end of the year or else this one is getting pushed back even further
spacex,not_removed,the latter two are all but certain to slip beyond january were probably starting on the schedule again
spacex,not_removed,planned for january no those are net no earlier than dates the dates listed are the earliest the launch could possibly occur and are based on what is likely to now be outof date information they are not promises that those launches will occur on those dates
spacex,not_removed,small scheduling delays like this are very common across the orbital launch industry and should be considered part of normal operating procedure no need to panic
spacex,not_removed,my money would be on pad issue yes the reason they have a net date for but not iridium is that iridium is waiting on a completion of the anomaly review and not much else echostar needs the new pad to be ready so if they know for sure the pad wont be ready for a launch until this date thats why they have a date for this one even if iridium is first which isnt confirmed that i know of they seem to be signalling that the signoff on the accident report wont take beyond december
spacex,not_removed,honestly id be happy with just the one no need to get greedy lol i know its just always interesting to see how pan out in situations like this usually not too accurately im glad that theyre at least giving customers more solid dates at this point
spacex,not_removed,yes but what is your point we know that the entire rocket is at vandenberg there is no reason they cant launch in december i see no reason why december being next week means anything more than they are getting closer to launch
spacex,not_removed,extra time to review iridium launch data
spacex,not_removed,could it be related to the explosion the other day might have brought up some complication this is my own personal speculation
spacex,not_removed,might not miss too many flights after all
spacex,not_removed,good to get back in practice again before trying to accelerate and they wont have the timing advantage of static fire with payload attached at least not at first spacex has been working on design improvements all along i wonder whether any will be implemented in the first launches elon had mentioned a more robust landing sequence that can compensate for variations in thrust of the landing engines
spacex,not_removed,otoh i remember someone shotwell musk say that their launch cadence is primarily constrained by manufacturing so if thats true and they had the chance to make a few cores during the hiatus and is flying a used core we might be off to a somewhat faster start
spacex,not_removed,i think thats why he said if that holds up suggesting that theres a good chance they wont actually happen in jan
spacex,not_removed,we know that the entire rocket is at vandenberg there is no reason they cant launch in december thats a big milestone for sure but there are still lots of steps to take before liftoff they havent released any information recently on the investigation that stuff has to be cleared up before they do anything related to fueling and firing the rocket the upgraded gse at vandenberg has yet to be tested out this stack will be the first run through with subcooled lox here and we all saw how much trouble that gave them the first few times at theyll want to review every bit of data they get regarding the new fueling procedures theyre going to implement especially since itll be the first use at an active launch pad i do hope they can get the launch off by the end of the year and it honestly doesnt matter if they launch dec or jan but the stark silence coming from official sources doesnt give me confidence
spacex,not_removed,highly unlikely those booms were related to accident investigation testing and anything that would have pushed echostar back would have pushed iridium back as well
spacex,not_removed,id be surprised if that is the case any more following they had many months to build up a stock of new and yet following rtf last december weve seen an average of one launch per month
spacex,not_removed,good points everyone is understandably keen to get back to launches this sub spacex and their customers not least of all and a dec launch would be a nice xmas present but even if rtf is start of jan thats still a month turnaround from a significant accident thats not too shabby
spacex,not_removed,i could see the pentagon ponying up towards the spaceship just as a technical demonstrator for global response our military really has a deep abiding affection for tech that will allow us access to anywhere in the world in minutes
spacex,not_removed,this is a bit off topic and i can move it to a other thread if asked i am going to take this opportunity to discuss militarizing the its if you can build a ship that crosses the ocean eventually someone will put a cannon on it does anyone think something similar will happen to the its i mean i dont see any reason to there is no one to fight so no need for weapons however you could use the its as orbital bombardment platform it would be a pretty great one actually with in orbit refueling and in orbit cargo personnel and ammunition replenishment coupled with the ability to change orbits or escape return fire it would be a very effective strategic weapons platform possible large scale tatical weapons platform if the kews kenetic enegery weapons aka guided rocks from space dropped from it had high accuracy i assume kew would be the ammunition of choice as it would pack the punch of nukes without the problems of launching them or radiation at the target site i mean its not exactly the for the betterment of humanity reason to build one but if the pentagon pays for it is that the worse thing in the world the next gen boomer subs are suppose to cost billion each and that doesnt include design cost seems like the its as a kew deployment platform serves the same function with more tatical uses its not exactly a fun topic to think about but this article got me to consider it

spacex,not_removed,at this stage of the investigation preliminary review of the data and debris suggests that a large breach in the cryogenic helium system of the second stage liquid oxygen tank took place i really hope they find the cause of the breach soon maybe a bird but they need to find the source quickly
spacex,not_removed,flyin alamo
spacex,not_removed,as elon said people spaceships explode all the time its just when spacexs explode they get if not times more press
spacex,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikisustainmilitary just sayin it was the first thought i had for who would pay a large fee to deliver something anywhere in the world in mins i dont see it working well in an environment but the link shows that there is some genuine interest
spacex,not_removed,the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiouterspacetreaty specifically prohibits putting weapons of mass destruction into orbit
spacex,not_removed,the ability to change orbits or escape return fire yeah no in space you dont even need to have a direct hit to take out a target if someone wants your platform gone they will be able to make that happen
spacex,not_removed,many modern militaries possess or will soon possess the technology to shoot down a satellite in leo using technology like the aegis combat system or the thaad a single missile could pretty effectively disable an mct class of spaceship and theres plenty of those just literally on navy destroyers floating around waiting for a bad day this is at best an unfounded fear if a rogue nation did decide to use satellites as weapons im pretty sure any civilized nation would be happy and able to shoot down each and every satellite that could pose a threat from that nation most of the reasons why boomer subs are still so critical is because theyre sneaky spaceships especially big spaceships are anything but sneaky
spacex,not_removed,i dont see what the point would be the powers strong enough to build something like that are strong enough to build enough regular bombers to continuosly have one at high altitiude near the target satellites are not impossible to shoot down bombers at very high altitude and high speed are tricky to shoot down bombing from orbit requires a significant delta v on each payload if its going to reach a target relatively quickly in regards to militarization i think its more interesting to hear what kind of earth observation telescopes this thing might bring us i mean imagine a ton eye staring down wow youll read the newspaper over peoples shoulder and of course this means weapons that can bring such a telescope down and defenses that counter those that is in my opinion the more reasonable militarization
spacex,not_removed,im not sure about the technical feasibility of such a concept low orbits might have too much horizontal velocity high orbits are too far away without active guidance any kind of precision doesnt seem achievable more so taking the atmosphere and supersonic trajectory turbulence if you want to go active an icbm might be more cost effective with similar capability but eh we shouldnt waste much thought into weapon systems hopefully large scale wars are a thing of the past
spacex,not_removed,its definitely interesting just by controlling a huge fleet of ships in orbit he would pretty much be capable of mass destruction no weapons needed
spacex,not_removed,im not sure what military acquisition laws are like in the us can they just step in and take it but i highly doubt elon would allow for military uses
spacex,not_removed,yes indeed the failure rate that spacex has experienced is on par with other new rocket systems
spacex,not_removed,extraction is some problem though
spacex,not_removed,could a rocket like that be prepared in minutes
spacex,not_removed,i find it highly improbable that the treaty isnt violated eventually all it takes is one or two capable countries like china and russia that are willing to ignore the treaty and a new arms race is on
spacex,not_removed,i wonder how much that treaty has ironically held space exploration back most of the worlds colonies were funded and founded by european countries in direct military competition with each other musks project could be funded with of ones years us military budget of course in an ideal world
spacex,not_removed,kews are just rocks though or rods of tungsten or something like that i dont think any current treaty bans those i guess it depends if kews are wmds or not in a legal sense
spacex,not_removed,but no restriction on conventional weapons including kinetic and high explosives
spacex,not_removed,i dont think you understand what i mean i dont mean dodge out of the way i mean fire the huge engines and leave their orbit entirely this is not avoid a near miss thing but leave the area entirely a fully fueled its in orbit can easily escape any ground fired missile provided they see it coming and it would be hard not to
spacex,not_removed,a great way for a rogue state to create havoc send up a few birds to various altitudes then have one drop a rock at cheyenne mountain up go the defences boom go your fake sats and then whole orbits are contaminated with debris which creates the actual havoc you wanted
spacex,not_removed,can the hit a target changing position in an erratic pattern in high orbit the its is a ship not a satellite with limited fuel and not a station on set path plus the is more designed for low orbit and the its does not need to be in low orbit to be a threat of armed with guided kews
spacex,not_removed,thats just the thing spacex is trying to get military sat launch contracts so in a sense they are alreasy military contractors this is another level but they are not exactly a pacifist organization if the dod comes to musk and says we will pay you the money to build your booster and weapons platform its that at least the cost of the whole project they just need to build the civilian version of the its which is basically the same without the kew launcher that would be hard to say no to if nasa is not beating down the door as well as for laws if its in a time of war senate voted on war not police action then basically yes they can take it otherwise spacex is a private company and the laws protects them from such action the senate declaring war would take a pretty dramatic geo political act like invade hawaii dramatic but mostly the pentagon gets these technologies by sending dump loads of cash at someone until that person says yes
spacex,not_removed,might the ship have enough fuel to make an escape hop not suborbital back to base but some location where extraction is less dangerous
spacex,not_removed,yeah as indicated in the article it would have to happen via different means
spacex,not_removed,good point one presumes it would be quicker than a falcon launch but theres some prep time regardless
spacex,not_removed,not to mention the treaty is absurd when it comes time to actually use space for anything resembling colonization spacexs mars plans as they start to take shape are going to force the issue of either withdrawal repeal or amendment of the ost i do think we can shoehorn property rights national sovereignty and eventual colony independence into the treaty while still reserving all countries a piece of the pie
spacex,not_removed,im pretty sure it would be considered a violation it will be a weapons platform in space and id say it would be quite dangerous for musk too since he plans to have thousands of them in parking orbit this means you could easily hide the platform among them the last thing musk wants is for other countries to view his spaceships as a threat
spacex,not_removed,while kinetic weapons are not considered wmds on the ground launched from an orbital platform they could impart such high energies that could be considered wmd
spacex,not_removed,i still dont think it would work as well as you think it would people on the ground know the precise movements of the its and the its has no knowledge of a launch and its trajectory until it happens even if you dont destroy the its you could set up a couple anti launches with the intention of only leaving an escape route that takes the its on a very bad orbit where they have no choice but to starve to death actually that is an even better point you just have to prevent resupply and its only a matter of time before the personell you mention become corpses
spacex,not_removed,kessler syndrome as a means of future terrorist activity thats pretty dark but it makes sense you could make certain orbits very dangerous and completely useless imagine exploding a satellite in a retrograde orbit at geosynchronous altitude actually no lets not imagine that
spacex,not_removed,nobody knows most probably the actual capabilities are classified
spacex,not_removed,the first time its used would have to be a longstanding crisis ala the iran hostage situation instead of carter sending in a haphazard helicopter mission itll be a militarized its lander touching down on the lawn of the embassy with marines storming out second time there will be landers to secure the entire area
spacex,not_removed,the thing is intented to prevent colinization by any member it basically and only leaves people who dont care about it to be able to colonize and thats either countries not signed no one space capable countries who are willing to break it or corperations and that last one is pretty worrying
spacex,not_removed,the treaty is very specific about nuclear biological chemical and radiological weapons so no they wouldnt be considered a violation by any of the terms of the treaty the thing is that putting that much weight into orbit is a hard thing to do and then you have to be able to deorbit it which would require a large amount of delta v and probably a substantial amount of fuel at the end of the day its easier to just nuke someone
spacex,not_removed,the last thing musk wants is for other countries to view his spaceships as a threat i disagree it would be last thing he would want if it meant financing his vision the opinion of other nations is probably not as high as the dream of multi planetary species if this was the only way to fund it but i see your point hopefully nasa and other agencies work together to help fund this so no one will have to consider this though if the its is successfully a few decades down the line someone is going to put the proverbial cannon on the ship that is just human nature if mankind becomes a space faring species then the you get the good with the bad
spacex,not_removed,i did some quick googling on the subject but the treaty onky says weapons of msss destruction and i think the legal definition of that is nuclear chemical or biological weopons the treaty is a legal document and so is bound by legal terminology so kews are a loophole especially kews that would be as powerful as a conventional bunker buster i could be massively wrong here but thats what my minute search presented
spacex,not_removed,the its is not stuck in an orbit like a space station and its not devoid of fuel for major orbital changes like the shuttle it has enough delta v to get to and land on mars so it should have plenty of delta v to change orbits by many kilometers many times in addition the its could make regular changes to its orbit so its hard to track them if they know they will get regualr refuels it may be worth it any missile fired at them has to climb out of the gravity well the its simply needs to detect it with the help of other satellites or their own radar system and fly thousands of kilometers away from the missles intercept zone the missile will not have enough delta v to drastically change its target orbit unless its the size of a saturn v launcher the time it takes for a missile to get anywhere near the its is enough time for the its to detect it and fire its engines to get away the raptor vacs in orbit can move a hell a lot faster then any missile filing up to orbital attitudes finally i am not talking about its vs the world but rather as a member of the us military so the us will keep the its resupplied via their own launches
spacex,not_removed,government signatories are responsible for the behaviour of companies within their jurisdiction the only way around it would be to move operations to a country that is not a signatory to the treaty which would of course be an itar violation
spacex,not_removed,its actually the same amount of dv but requires more fuel
spacex,not_removed,first of all none of us knows what elon would think of that idea he himself has said humanity needs to be on more than one planet to avoid an eventual extinction event i dont think financing the architecture for a second planet by putting weapons of mass descruction in the orbit of the first planet ist a very good idea do you if humanity indeed becomes multiplanetary of course it will happen but at the beginning i dont think there is a reason martins would be a danger to earthlings if any then viceversa
spacex,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikijudicialinterpretation applies to constitution international treateas etc simply said its the intention of the drafters that matters not the exact words or exemplar lists
spacex,not_removed,the its is huge fueled its also very massive kinetic interceptors such as the are fast and maneuverable they are designed to change course during terminal acquisition to maximize the probability of a hit compared to the rvs that they are designed for the its is a whale if the its is in leo it will have seconds to move before it is struck anything higher and the problem becomes academic
spacex,not_removed,still doesnt address the resupply problem any launch is climbing the gravity well and a missile has a lot less weight i imagine there are not many orbits where the entire resupply could be done over us airspace
spacex,not_removed,no i dont think its a good idea but the possibility of it happening is there so its worth discussing
spacex,not_removed,its much easier to throw small bomb up miles high you can do this with a very small missile than it is to change the orbit of a ton spaceships theres at least ships in the us navy capable of doing this right now as well as several us army regiments that can do this other nations also have this capability and the technology to do so becomes more available with each passing year case in point the aegis bmds on any one of several arleigh burke class destroyer can detect track target and attack satellites with no external help the time of flight for an missile on intercept to leo is less than minutes and the current version has terminal guidance with control thrusters that correct the trajectory all the way up this would give any spaceship in low earth orbit very little if any time to evade even with countermeasures its not unreasonable to expect multiple missiles each of which would be programmed to defeat countermeasures and the missiles dont have to hit directly other nations are developing similar systems including china russia israel england france india and if space based weapons were a ever to become a real threat you can be sure that these missile defense projects will suddenly gain massive funding
spacex,not_removed,true that is when its at its most vulnerable this has turned onto a fascinating conversation makes me want to write a near future scifi story
spacex,not_removed,not when the possibility is ridiculously low
spacex,not_removed,if a launch at a specific target can be detected the only thing that matters is which object can alter its trajectory by a greater amount before the intercept kinetic kill vehicles have the ability to change course yes but they dont have much total deltav they are designed for targets with no or minimal ability to alter their course if we assume an intercept time after warning of even minute and an its with of max thrust the kinetic kill vehicle would need to be able to divert as much as now i dont know how much deltav a typical kkv might have but the sooner the kkv is detected and the its begins evasive maneuvers the more heavily this engagement shifts towards favoring the its which will inherently have considerably more deltav but a lower acceleration
spacex,not_removed,its a nice achilles heel scenario d
spacex,not_removed,watch httpsenwikipediaorgwikiplanetes very nearfuture hard scifi with current day technology and correct orbital mechanics loworbit missile action is a major plot point halfway through the series
spacex,not_removed,josh said josh brost spacex should have activated for launches in less than a month hopefully launch from there later this year spacexs brost main key to beyond leo access is breaking the cost to leo brost i definitely see the signs of growth in the commercial launch market my own listening
spacex,not_removed,panel on reusability on right now includes spacex nasa blue origin and ula representation notes so far spacex customers doesnt care if the rocket is overpowered in order to allow for reusability they just care for their payload to be put in orbit cost of building and checking is in first stage able to test reusablity with no effect on primary mission blue origin ns is a stepping stone for ng reusability ns to fly crewed in will fly customers engines designed for restarts throttle between lbf has done seconds of testing never removed from ns booster after flights just checks stage ng uses for second stage and is focused on leo mass penalty that is why ng is so large completed windtunnel testing of both ng versions tests of combustion chamber nasa taking a reusable components and making them expendable because that is what is most affordable flat funding profile forces one to use previous hardware would have done things differently if it wasnt flat funded for example composite casings for solid boosters optimizing for as much payload as possible per launch and as few launches as possible will basically be in leo by the time they are done so not possible to recover european swiss fairings dude problem is that fairing is of the cost of the rocket might not make much sense to recover water intrusion was a worry easy to fix being floppy was a worry easy to fix floats in water fine have to look overall if it is worth it seems to actually to do it is fairly straight forward ula claims payload hit is if one returns the stage to land focused on lowest upfront costs and most potential cost savings in return hence engine recovery made the most sense and had low performance hit inflatable aeroshell to protect the engine in flight capture with a helicopter never mind there isnt helicopters in the world able to recover two class engines darpa worked on dcx all of dcx data gigs was shared with spacex and bo reusable first stage expendable second stage goal to fly times in days reusablity done right is far more economical reusable not qa engines on shuttle had to be removed mostly because of access to them not because they had to same thing with tearing the engine down it was out might as well do it question to spacex regarding insurance saferbetter to fly on reused stage not a very large premium so far most reliable mission is flight most risk sensitive customers would like to fly on those usafnasa had discussion on that spacex landing systems dont effect risk wise the primary mission merlins are reusable so they are safer boosters back loads of data important to see how things look after returning
spacex,not_removed,spacex was doing a presentation at the time i posted this dont know if they are going to talk again edit josh brost is talking for spacex
spacex,not_removed,bigelow render of the with docked possibly seen before paired more attached to iss httpsiimgurcomdhbnhaepng dedocked and finally the ula partnership kicks in the speaker lisa thomas says that bigelow has the funding to privately build she also gratuitously keeps praising robert bigelows business acumen and wealth
spacex,not_removed,according to richard feynmans book in which he talks about his time on the challenger investigation board they tear the engines down after each flight because the engine internal parts were wearing out faster than they should have and things needed to be replaced the engineers did not seem concerned about this because engine failure had never lost a mission but feynman thought they should have been concerned because the engines were not behaving as expected

spacex,not_removed,so blue origin is further ahead than i thought the race is heating up why are ula banking on inflight capture it makes all the problems with recovery about ten times worse so this is essentially the
spacex,not_removed,so ruag the swiss fairing makers for ariane and atlas are also looking at fairing reuse they probably want see how well it works for spacex
spacex,not_removed,nasa taking a reusable components and making them expendable because that is what is most affordable flat funding profile forces one to use previous hardware would have done things differently if it wasnt flat funded for example composite casings for solid boosters optimizing for as much payload as possible per launch and as few launches as possible emphasis mine this seems rather telling it seems like a very different mindset than spacex who wants to launch often and keep margin overpowered rocket so that each paid launch is also opportunity for experimentation
spacex,not_removed,regarding the helicopter capture of the vulcan engines assuming weigh about the same as that is tons the chinook can has a stated cargo capacity of tons even with some thrust structure that should be doable also early spy satellites had their film canisters captured by airplanes while falling under a parachute so there is precedent for this type of recovery i would say it is not any more risky than trying to land on a barge in the middle of the ocean what is curious is ula always mentioning the performance hit by landing the first stage but never the performance hit from packing an aeroshell and parachutes as well as the risk of an additional stagingdecoupling event however in ulas defense their new rocket will have a large portion of the work to orbit done with the stage leaving it flying much faster than a first stage at meco
spacex,not_removed,twas a valiant effort
spacex,not_removed,the speaker lisa thomas says that bigelow has the funding to privately build she also gratuitously keeps praising robert bigelows business acumen and wealth doesnt help if bigelow is a horrible company to actually work for which is what you are hearing from basically everyone who ever worked there the turnover is pretty horrible supposedly
spacex,not_removed,she also gratuitously keeps praising robert bigelows business acumen and wealth sometimes you just have to rub a persons ego in order to keep them excited about doing what you want them to do its not exactly a proud moment but it works
spacex,not_removed,the engineers did not seem concerned about this because engine failure had never lost a mission but feynman thought they should have been concerned because the engines were not behaving as expected granted this was years ago but holy crap you can play russian roulette and make the same claim of it hasnt killed me when ive done it before
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,yeah catching a falling booster with a helicopter just seems like it would add far more failure points plus now if something goes really wrong youve got the helicopter crew in danger as well
spacex,not_removed,taking a reusable component and making it expendable isnt that like taking the passenger seats etc out of your car and then scrapping it at the end of the journey and saying but look i saved money i took out the nonessential components edit or do i misunderstand
spacex,not_removed,catching it at an altitude mid air almost certainly quite far out in the sea as is whole different matter than lifting a payload from the ground and transporting it so on paper and all should be able to do it but in practice dunno very difficult imho
spacex,not_removed,josh brost is on the panel and its still happening edit and now its over
spacex,not_removed,i dont condone it or believe in it myself but apple has been able to produce iphones despite worker suicides i have heard amazon is horrible too its possible bigelow will still perfrom despite this unfortunate environment
spacex,not_removed,holy crap not really nasa was stuck between a rock and a hard place do a bunch of extra safety inspections and you quickly end up in a death spiral of ever increasing costs per launch thats what happened after challenger and to add insult to injury it still didnt prevent columbia the program goes under and people lose their whole lives work dont do the inspections and eventually people die both options are terrible the only glimmer of hope is that maybe if run the program at a cost that doesnt get it cancelled and get really lucky things will be ok they tried that and it didnt work out now you might be saying how could they knowingly risk human lives well the only way not to risk lives would be to spend an infinite amount of money investigating infinite things that could go wrong before launching at the end of the day you have to accept some risk if you want to launch to some nasa took too many risks on the other hand when nasa was pushing back the frontiers in the they took even bigger risks
spacex,not_removed,this was feynmans first exposure to the it hasnt failed yet thinking that pervaded nasa at the time he was astounded and went looking for more examples this whole episode including his final report forms a large part of his book what do you care what other people think
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,sounds downright cartoonish to me i cant be the only one
spacex,not_removed,apples workers have a much lower suicide rate than the us or chinese average when you have a million workers theres going to be a couple similarly the stories about amazon were disputed as far as i know pretty much nobody has ever said they liked it at bigelow
spacex,not_removed,i dont really know how much of his plans are possible however i would say that his style of being crazy optimistic about the futures possibilities has worked out for him multiple times before im sure they dont have all the details worked out but id rather spacex be too ambitious rather than too cautious at least if they fall short in some areas theyll still come out ahead of what most companies would aim for this has always been his way of thinking downside is obviously we cant trust his timelines but im ok with slipped deadlines as long as we actually get some humans to mars
spacex,not_removed,i cant link because im on mobile but look up the cgi video they released when they first talked about reusability a lot of people were very skeptical when they saw that one and now it seems a lot more believable
spacex,not_removed,i have my doubts that the colony can be fully sustained by solar power from a first principles standpoint energy is essential for survival and survival on mars requires significant amounts of energy elon quickly said the nuar word and followed it up with some qualifiers but i think he knows that having all eggs in the solar basket is not ideal a small colony will require many acres of arrays on the surface of mars the its lander will require acres of solar itself at some point perhaps sooner than later nuclear will be the practical option geothermal has some potential to diversify the energy profile also aside from the obvious timeline and funding the other big question marks for me are booster launchlanding pad weve seen recent evidence that multiple pads will be necessary to sustain launches per aspera the its pad in the animation is a leap forward in complexity that will be hard doable for good engineers but very hard its crew quarters sardines anyone mars hab i dont see spacex doing this on their own other companies will likely provide these solutions
spacex,not_removed,i can see musk following thru with this system with some help from nasa and esa i cant see massive colonization working anytime soon the selffunded martian plan is too optimistic i think the giant geodesic window on the its is fantasy theres just too many points of failure same with the seeming lack of airtight compartments within the ship one hit from space debris and everyone dies
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,yes ive seen that too and actually had the exact same thought watching the ict video we can only hope they deliver on ict to the same degree but its a far more ambitious plan
spacex,not_removed,to be fair httpiimgurcomnwnmhrrpng hopefully this doesnt qualify as low effort
spacex,not_removed,for everyone who is saying that an elevator on a crane seems unreliable please consider that out of the thousands and thousands of cranes operated on earth every day almost none ever fail and thats in martian gravity also consider that the its is going to use rocket engines which historically have a failure rate very significantly higher than that of cranes a crane is about as simple a cargo unloading system as you can get its essentially a metal beam on a swivel with a pulley system attached and some electric motors i actually think that even if the its had its cargo hold right next to the ground somehow the people unloading stuff would still need a crane its not like a forklift would be less complicated or easier to operate on mars and theres no way unloading by hand is an option because im sure that even in martian g there will be items weighing several tons
spacex,not_removed,the only thing i didnt like about andy weirs excellent book the martian was the extremely exaggerated wind forces at the beginning a cable elevator makes perfect sense on mars that said can any one enlighten me why specifically three cables
spacex,not_removed,this is pretty exciting to imagine im sure a huge amount of the its will change between now and the first crewed landing on mars but its fun to picture the equivalent of neil armstrong stepping off the lms landing pad an astronaut riding the elevator down to the surface the doors open they step off onto the red soil for the first time
spacex,not_removed,weve seen many predictions on reddit of the payload bay being at the bottom with complex fuel tank structures through and around the ship pivoting engines etc its apparent now that spacex is keeping it simple stupid i would suggest they have as large as a cargo bay door they can allow so payload designs in the future arent constrained the door would hinge up to degrees parallel with the surface providing a truss sticking off to the side of the ship the crane could move across the cargo bay ceiling out to the hinged door which then could lower the payloads to the surface a basket or elevator of some sort could also be present for certain smaller supplies and of course people most of the mass weight would probably be in the door and extended hydraulic supports on each side of the door from a side profile view it would look like a triangle
spacex,not_removed,a slide would be more fun

spacex,not_removed,sounds rather like the windowwashing setup installed in tall buildings a couple boom arms cables and pulleys and a platform to raise and lower simple proven in use in like a million places around the world probably something they can buy off the shelf with little need for tweaks
spacex,not_removed,i dont recall seeing an airlock in the fly through video i wonder if the plan is to depressurize the entire cabin on egress if thats the case yikes
spacex,not_removed,well that answers one question now on to the logical next question will unloading be automated or manned
spacex,not_removed,what im guessing is elon meant the crane would be assemble on the storage compartment and eased outside to the hatch for crew and materials to ground level
spacex,not_removed,i assumed theyd manage to fit a passenger tunnel to the base and ground level airlock with cargo going via crane but i guess a crane carried elevator car could be lighter on mass than an access tunnel
spacex,not_removed,idk sounds somehow too complicated what if it breaks is there an easy way to get back into the ship i think some things need to be as simple as possible for emergency situations
spacex,not_removed,is this crane a part of the its
spacex,not_removed,how far could one jump down in gravity
spacex,not_removed,does anyone know what the highest surviveable drop height on mars would be on one hand the gravity is much less but on the other the air is much thinner im sure it would have something to do with the and the terminal velocity and the added weightcushioning of the mars suits and the reduced bone density after the earthmars transfer and such but im just not smart enough to do this on my own
spacex,not_removed,i know he plans to use beyond mars too and that mars has relatively low wind speeds what about other bodies in the solar system that could have higher wind speeds causing it to tip over
spacex,not_removed,i find it highly amusing that of all the questions about the presentation the one with the simplest engineering solution was answered first
spacex,not_removed,stupid question what if somebody has a big sneeze there may be no wind force but the movement from people inside the elevator may move it and make it hit the bfs or land on its side on earth elevators with people inside have trails
spacex,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment actually he knows that the winds on mars arent that strong and are rather weak it was a deliberate sacrifice for dramatic purposes soyuz would disagree with you i wouldnt count on that is this what you are referring to to me that looks like a door but not an airlock im guessing that the airlock is in the center of the ship between the crew and cargo sections in his talk musk mentioned that cargo is unpressurized im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
spacex,not_removed,i thought theyd be taking electric diggers bulldozers forklifts and other heavy equipment qute early and originally imagined them driving them off a ramp is stuff like that going to need to be disassembled to get in the elevator and reassembled on the ground or will the elevator be big and tough enough to drive a digger onto
spacex,not_removed,im confused is this three separate cable elevators or one elevator that uses cables i would assume it to be the former as the ship itself have three faces except for the windowheat shield and seem to generally be designed with a rotational symmetry of the order of so it feels safe to assume there will be airlocks with elevators additionally going into the specific details on how many cables the elevator will use seem unnecessary detailed for this level of proposal discussion edit on the other hand the tweet says elevator not elevators
spacex,not_removed,the ship is going to be to most useful item yes you definitely need the others but the shape and design allows for so much here on earth destinations in minutes it would really be nice to get numbers on people or cargo in this situation imagine polar caps on earth or for military bombs coming out of the side while the craft does a fly by on its way to a refueling point mars and the moons will be most helpful for the colony leave a few on the surface for long distance travel colony to polar caps to collect water ice then back to colony or a orbital depot over time this would change to robotic rover trains or hyperloops without the tubes
spacex,not_removed,looses
spacex,not_removed,this thing can land anywhere in the solar system with a hard body dont worry we will design the elevator just for martian atmosphere what could go wrong
spacex,not_removed,hey that is a one cable crane cant be compared at all
spacex,not_removed,seems kind of obvious when you think about it got to love the wooden crates in space though
spacex,not_removed,no thats brilliant because i thought the same thing
spacex,not_removed,yeah a motor and a windlass dead simple technology ridiculously robust and quite lightweight for the distance it can cover its a good solution almost certainly more reliable than anything else i could imagine
spacex,not_removed,andy weir has admitted to knowing in advance ie before people wrote him letters complaining about this fault that the wind being a problem was unrealistic but wasnt sure his other idea for kicking off the man vs nature story with nature striking first would be as believable as wind turns out his other idea lightning actually happens on mars
spacex,not_removed,andy weir actually addressed that issue prior to the movie being released basically there were two major scientific mistakes that he had in the book the winds that strand watney on mars couldnt happen in real life yeah id probably make the initial disaster an engine test failure instead of a sandstorm its the most glaring physical inaccuracy in the book and i wish i hadnt made that concession to drama i think i could have set it up so an mav engine test blasted watney impaling him with debris and started leaking fuel forcing them to launch something like that when watney almost blows up the habitat trying to make water from hydrazine he also addressed this in a chemist sent me an email about the hydrazine reduction mark did in the hab turns out the rate he was reducing hydrazine would have heated up the hab to leathal temperatures so thats an error in the book i could have taken care of it by having mark bring a bunch of rocks in from outside rock is an excellent heat sink and would work to keep the temperature reasonable in the hab it would have been a cool sciencey solution to a problem
spacex,not_removed,that said can any one enlighten me why specifically three cables redundancy elevators get away with having one cable because they also have safety brakes that stop the car from falling if the cable breaks this elevator has no shaft though so they need multiple cables for redundancy i have to disagree with on the stability thing i expect each cable will fasten to the top and the whole platform would hang from a single pivot if it were done like an upsidedown stool with three separate pivots a single cable snapping would tip the platform dropping the passengers to their deaths
spacex,not_removed,just my speculation but i would make it actually be just one cable running from a single winch drum through a series of pulleys and cable brakes on the crane boom and lifting hookpassenger car mechanical advantage lets you use a motor the size motor vs motors a single winch drum makes manual winching a possibility no need to turn three drums in unison i think one larger drumfor coiling the cable could be made lighter than smaller drums
spacex,not_removed,it is the smallest amount of cables that results in a stable hanging platform with four cables you add extra mass to the elevator system without a significant gain in stability or strength cables would be good for extra reliability but if the elevator is designed for earth there is no way its going to fail on mars
spacex,not_removed,maybe its two guidance cables that get fastened to the ground and just one loadbearing cable
spacex,not_removed,the author said it was one of the things he didnt research well enough and would have used a different crisis if he had
spacex,not_removed,that and the high abundance of perchlorates in the martian soil would mean watney wouldnt have been able to grow potatoes at all these two were the only inaccuracies that stood out to me
spacex,not_removed,there you go fits with the airline metaphor a slide with handles for climbing back up almost like a bouncyhouse on mars speaking of which
spacex,not_removed,or a firehouse pole
spacex,not_removed,uorangeredstilton sup bud quick suggestion for the mav entry maybe make the possibly fictional a link to the martians wiki page since that would be the most recognisable example of it in fiction
spacex,not_removed,there is plent of room in this behemoth to put an air lock the shuttle had one and it is tiny in comparison plus the idea of docking sort of assume there will be one though that does produce a new thought people can do evas in the coast phase if they want to
spacex,not_removed,i think the best solution would be an internal airlock from the crew compartment into the unpressurized cargo compartment and then a cargo hatch which opens out the side serving dual purpose of boarding crew and loading cargo if this is the case i think the fly through started entering from the airlock at the base of the cabin which would explain why it was not shown this would have multiple advantages access to cargo midtrip without a spacewalk lighter less rugged airlock construction because it doesnt need to be part of the external structure of the ship no airlock coveraerodynamic faring required because it isnt exposed to launch reentry
spacex,not_removed,can we remember that it isnt fully designed yet airlocks have been designed before i doubt they are caring about those kind of details yet
spacex,not_removed,there are airlocks on the spaceship from what i noticed from the videojust zoom in
spacex,not_removed,on the lander order of business will be fuel production and that mean setting up the solar field for the required power so its got to automated and very simple ive also been thinking about how far away it needs to be eventually the lander will depart and create a huge blast zone thats likely to raise dust for an extended period weeks dont want to ruin the equipment perhaps it will be a powered wagon that arrives preloaded once it hits the ground it moves a few klicks away and then sets up shop any idea if the storage tanks could be inflatable im thinking the cold will make most plastics useless maybe the wagon drags a hose connected to the lander which is disconnected during launch lots to think about
spacex,not_removed,unloading the crew spaceship could be manual possibly using a flying fox with remote braking to speed up the process the cargo spaceships x more of those are planend than crew ships is still unclear do they sit there twiddling their gyros until a human comes along to unload them or is there an automated process to unload manhandling heavy loads like bulldozer buckets or engine blocks wont be easy either way whatever the gravity id initially expect it all to be manual as the refuelling cant occur until the cargo is clear of the ship
spacex,not_removed,having a tunnel through your fuel tank structure would be inviting structural problems as well
spacex,not_removed,not sure how you get simpler than a cable elevator if it breaks you just replace the cable
spacex,not_removed,a pulley and rope is one of the first simple tools created he said its on a crane if the elevator breaks it should be simple to fix or they could easily attach a pulley with rope or a cable too the crane boom with earth gravity you could pull yourself up and down if you had to
spacex,not_removed,probably has a manual crank with a sufficient gear ratio to be able to raise or lower people in the event that the automatic mechanism fails
spacex,not_removed,thats why there are three of them i guess i would interpret the tweet as three cableelevators and not threecableelevators
spacex,not_removed,a simple rope ladder to climb up or down in case of an emergency should do the trick with only gravity should be an easy climb
spacex,not_removed,has to be or else how would you unload the crane on the first mission
spacex,not_removed,well logically it must be unless you plan to land it separately before the its with a custom landing vehicle
spacex,not_removed,im assuming it is that it has to be assemble inside the storage level where all materials for crew mining material power etc for delivery to the mars surface
spacex,not_removed,assuming impact velocity is the limiting factor as high as you could on earth i wouldnt want to do anything too adventurous in a space suit though
spacex,not_removed,without hurting yourself try here on earth then
spacex,not_removed,at short heights as high interestingly terminal velocity would be much lower so jumping off terminal velocity height would be worse although both are fatal either way
spacex,not_removed,at least miles
spacex,not_removed,terminal velocity on mars is so high that it makes no difference over the short distances that the speed would become fatal the real problem is that there is no hard and fast rule about what speeds are fatal a lot depends on how soft the ground is and the person in question as a rough guide it appears a speed of around is the area where fatality becomes possible then likely and over is considered generally fatal on mars the height you would need to fall from to reach is roughly ballparking from the technical slides the cargo bay appears to be at a height of around so it depends on the physical health of the person and the softness of the ground needless to say if you fell there is a significant chance you would die
spacex,not_removed,lets crawl before we walk
spacex,not_removed,there are only two other bodies that it could land on with significant atmospheres and i doubt wind speed will be your biggest concern on venus titan will definitely be an issue though low gravity dense atmosphere and wind speeds of over
spacex,not_removed,if youre worried about the platform swaying for some reason the first time down you can fix tether points to the ground so that its not able to sway into the ship
spacex,not_removed,more importantly i suspect stuff like that will need to be disassembled to get in the ship at all but they wont be just earth standard dozers anyway theyll be custom built mars equipment not like you can run a diesel dozer on mars so theyll be built in a modular way that allows them to plug together i presume
spacex,not_removed,could you give me a list of rocky bodies in the solar system with atmospheres
spacex,not_removed,titan and venus are literally the only bodies with meaningful atmospheres aside from earth and they are not places humans have any reason to get outside on let alone visit
spacex,not_removed,i have a suspicion that we wont accidentally end up on venus or titan when embarking on a mars mission
spacex,not_removed,works for earth as well
spacex,not_removed,heh you call it wood i call it advanced lightweight biodegradable composite biopolymer
spacex,not_removed,its from tintin a frenchlanguage comic specifically explorers on the moon published in edit frenchlanguage author is belgian
spacex,not_removed,equivalent to spongebobs hours later i would imagine
spacex,not_removed,also in gravity you could even handwinch it if the gearingpulleys are appropriately made
spacex,not_removed,yeah id probably make the initial disaster an engine test failure instead of a sandstorm its the most glaring physical inaccuracy in the book and i wish i hadnt made that concession to drama i think i could have set it up so an mav engine test blasted watney impaling him with debris and started leaking fuel forcing them to launch something like that it looks like hes had time to come up with a few different realistic scenarios postpublishing to solve the problem and any of them can basically be inserted pretty seamlessly in your own headcanon
spacex,not_removed,removed a silly chain joke about numbers our rules specifically mention low effort chain jokes
spacex,not_removed,the spaceship has center plus ring engines while the booster has center plus inner ring plus outer ring engines seems he digs multiples of and although more likely its just a result of optimization calculations
spacex,not_removed,maybe hes a fan of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikithetripods
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,a single cable snapping would tip the platform dropping the passengers to their deaths think wire cage like a construction site elevator for exactly this reason
spacex,not_removed,but if it was single pivot on the elevator you would have to balance the cog of whatever is in the elevator under the pivot every time you use it or else it will hang crooked i think thats the benefit of a three cable system assuming no guide rails
spacex,not_removed,well cables wouldnt actually increase reliability if one fails you have an elevator dangling at a bad angleincreasing loads on other cables excactly the same as with two cables
spacex,not_removed,martian dust is very nasty might be a problem for exposed machinery like a cable elevator
spacex,not_removed,actually he knows that the winds on mars arent that strong and are rather weak
spacex,not_removed,actually its quite the opposite he knew it was wrong its just that thats how he had to set up the situation everything else in the novel is as accurate as he could make it he even wrote a program to figure out the exact timing for transfer windows to mars as a side note one thing he did miss is perchlorates to be fair we didnt know they were in the martian soil at the time and all it takes is a quick rinse of water to clean it
spacex,not_removed,plants have been grown in simulated mars soil and with organic fertilizer the soil yields almost as much as on earth whether they would be healthy to eat is another question
spacex,not_removed,and we werent aware of the perchlorates when he wrote the novel it would also only take a quick rinse of water to clean the soil
spacex,not_removed,not quite weir has talked about these inaccuracies openly the perchlorates were only discovered after the book was originally written which is why they arent included the same goes for liquid water existing not that far from where watney was the updated version of events would have required watney to rinse the perchlorates out of the soil but its a process that is very much still possible
spacex,not_removed,those findings came out after to book was released but right before the movie came out
spacex,not_removed,that seems sensible mav updated
spacex,not_removed,people can do evas in the coast phase if they want to indeed i was thinking if some minor repairs or visual inspections were necessary by humans this would allow for that theyll probably have a robot or two as well as some robot arms but some things need a human touch
spacex,not_removed,looking at the technical slides there seems to be a fairly solid bulkhead between the crew area and the cargo bay which does seem to support your theory of course if the cargo bay is unpressurized through the entire trip then accessing it mid trip would involve putting on a spacesuit and all the other eva preparations just with less risk of drifting off into space
spacex,not_removed,is what you are referring to to me that looks like a door but not an airlock im guessing that the airlock is in the center of the ship between the crew and cargo sections in his talk musk mentioned that cargo is unpressurized
spacex,not_removed,eventually the lander will depart and create a huge blast zone thats likely to raise dust for an extended period weeks what if the first lander never departs stays on mars as a big fuel tank surrounded by solar panels subsequent landers just have to land far enough away not to disturb it set up a long pipe and suck out the fuel
spacex,not_removed,im imagining what amounts to remote control cats probably in operation once people arrive and have low latency control
spacex,not_removed,it also complicates plumbing quite a bit and has thermal issues there is already a feed line for lox going through the fuel tank you would have to work around cant have both centered which further complicates structural issues thermally you would have a pressurized crew tunnel going through cryogenic fuel tanks thats a bad idea
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,i would expect him to pluralize elevator and crane if that were the case but with twitterspeak we cant be sure
spacex,not_removed,they initially planned to use a rope ladder for the lem turned out it wasnt a great idea
spacex,not_removed,it would literaly only need to be a beam fixed in the ceiling that you slide out through the open cargo bay door on that beam you have a slider with a pulley system attached simplest design in the world used everywhere
spacex,not_removed,your bodys mass would be the same but with the lighter gravity wouldnt your muscles and bones have less to fight against to change the direction of your bodys velocity on impact less whack when you hit the ground
spacex,not_removed,i would imagine its ever so slightly less than that since theres less air resistance as you fall
spacex,not_removed,so almost a foot then
spacex,not_removed,why would terminal velocity be lower with the thinner air wouldnt the comparative lack of drag result in a higher terminal velocity
spacex,not_removed,ive slid down ropes that high on earth in low gravity it would be easy if the gravity is so much lower climbing back up wouldnt be too bad either
spacex,not_removed,for titan i would think the primary focus would be on fixing all the problems the extremely low temperature causes
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if it could land on titan
spacex,not_removed,yep good idea i didnt thought about that
spacex,not_removed,venus earth mars titan
spacex,not_removed,technically the answer to that is all of them
spacex,not_removed,technically jupiter saturn and neptune are rocky bodies if you go down far enough its the atmosphere that will get you though
spacex,not_removed,venus sure but titan seems like a pretty good candidate for colonization later on only major downside is the travel time but that can be solved by just using an even more ridiculously huge rocket eh
spacex,not_removed,speak for yourself i would love to visit venus you can live in the atmosphere while you wait for the planet to cool off after installing giant sun shades in space not with elons billion dollar carbon fiber rocket though
spacex,not_removed,i think carl sagan is right and we can build floating habitats in the venusian atmosphere easier than colonize mars there i said it
spacex,not_removed,no earths atmosphere is so thick they cant even launch rockets with a storm in the way so no
spacex,not_removed,one mans garbage wood is another mans compost fodder
spacex,not_removed,isnt it belgian
spacex,not_removed,you could do the same in earth gravity theres basically no difference if youre using man power to move tons or tons either way youre looking at a very slow egress of cargo p since electric motors are basically reliable as long as there arent any factory defects i dont think hand winching will be required and if one of the motors does break and no spares are available and the other two cranes are inoperable im still certain that the people on board will have the tools necessary to cut open the motor housing and slap together a hand winch restoring the ability to put stuff on the ground and make it useful
spacex,not_removed,they spent billion dollars to get me here but they had to make me winch the crane myself
spacex,not_removed,i sat for an entire afternoon thinking about it and its just absurdly difficult to imagine a scenario where an astronaut could be unknowingly marooned kills all remaining communication equipment while leaving enough equipment to survive and with enough time pressure to force them not to make any effort to look for him even the engine test scenario doesnt work because it just becomes ridiculous to hurt watney and the antenna my other major issue with the book is that nasa didnt image the site immediately after theres no way that would happen even if they didnt want to it would blatantly obvious what they were trying to do and theyd look like fools for it that could still be worked out though because they could easily have just imaged the site while watney was inside nursing his wounds for a few days and then not imaged it for a while because there was no further point
spacex,not_removed,oh my god ive found my new favorite subreddit rule thank you
spacex,not_removed,can anybody tell me why design and engineering decisions like that are so often attributed to musk instead of the spacex team around here
spacex,not_removed,technically id call the center engine surrounded by a ring of different than a ring of
spacex,not_removed,i was thinking httpsenwikipediaorgwikirendezvouswithrama i think there is a lot of overlap between a visionary like musk and arthur c clarke though in rendezvous the three was for redundancy where there doesnt seem to be much redundancy in the newly announced spacex vehicles
spacex,not_removed,which instead causes all passengers to be thrown to one side and the people on the bottom to be crushed if it is only person at a time no problem but anything above and you run the risk of the bottom person being crushed and dying of asphyxiation
spacex,not_removed,but if it was single pivot on the elevator you would have to balance the cog of whatever is in the elevator under the pivot every time you use it or else it will hang crooked typically a httpiimgurcomjblhetojpg is used
spacex,not_removed,moon dust is nasty mars dust isnt so bad opportunity is still chugging along after years continuous operation
spacex,not_removed,probably only after prolonged exposure so unless theyre going to leave the elevator hanging outside for years it should be fine
spacex,not_removed,huh wonder why i thought that
spacex,not_removed,afaik plants have been grown in simulated mars soil that did not include accurate amounts of percolates
spacex,not_removed,the robot arm would be a good idea to help with docking and any eva activity not sure where it would go i guess their will be a cargo door it can hide in if they have the room seems like adding a canada arm system unless they want to make their own is a no brainer
spacex,not_removed,elon mentioned unpressurized cargo space in his presentation so i was picturing any trip into this space requiring a suit equivalent to their dragon commerical crew suit vacuum protection without the gear required for an eva
spacex,not_removed,awesome loading suits like in aliens
spacex,not_removed,id guess that the first fleet would have unloaders similar in concept to what aircraft use now platforms which raise up to the cargo door and lower the pallets down to the ground once the first one is built it can be driven to each spaceship and rapid unloading can occur
spacex,not_removed,it looks like the biggest issue with the rope with apollo was the heavy bulky suit thats an issue that they wouldnt have on mars
spacex,not_removed,ropes and rope ladders are different things also we can hopefully make better spacesuits today than we could in the
spacex,not_removed,theres nothing you can do to fight against gravity in freefall barring flapping your arms against the atmosphere the effect of which is negligible on earth never mind mars in freefall you can consider yourself weightless and the only thing affecting how quickly you can accelerate your limbs is their mass which is constant no matter where you are mass is constant weight can change depending on the gravity at the planet
spacex,not_removed,air resistance is negligible on earth over distances that are comfortable to jump from
spacex,not_removed,yes correct
spacex,not_removed,as well as a power source at saturn distance and with titans atmosphere those solar panels wont be generating a whole lot of power nuclear will probably be required for titan that would give you a heat source to work with too
spacex,not_removed,hmm i think the issue is going to be whether it can throttle the three central engines low enough to land on titan apparently they can throttle to around if you assume its loaded with cargo its weight will probably be tonnes when the fuel is nearly depleted assuming the tonne mark to be optimistic each engine would have to put out a mere to achieve twr of even with throttling and reduced isp from titans atmosphere that seems low so any landing would have to be a hoverslam with twr probably around
spacex,not_removed,venus is useless to colonize on earth theres the cranecrewcargo arm mars is possible according to elon i agree the cable elevator is not viable on titan if were going to titan though im sure spacex has bigger issues than the crew elevator
spacex,not_removed,the lander probably wouldnt survive the pressure and heat at the surface of venus anyway
spacex,not_removed,i meant with substantial atmospheres that might have wind
spacex,not_removed,is the density of gazes around some of the smaller m asteroids higher than in interplanetary space
spacex,not_removed,have they confirmed this i was under the impression that they did not have a solid core just a highly pressurized liquid mess
spacex,not_removed,this is not true as far as we know there is nothing rocky about those planets the gasses do indeed become solid from the massive pressure as you go down but its not rocky there is no surface to land on even if you could survive
spacex,not_removed,the biggest problem on titan is the cold not the distance itd be easier to keep a station warm on pluto than on titan because the atmosphere would suck heat away faster than it would radiate in a vacuum
spacex,not_removed,then why are you so worked up over this if you recognize its cant tackle venus anyways
spacex,not_removed,id love to visit venus but the its is absolutely not capable of surviving on the surface of venus without massive changes floating bases in the upper atmosphere are fascinating but would be highly risky and there is not clear way that an ist could seriously deploy such a base
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,i have a feeling that its will be able to launch in much more adverse weather than the flimsy falcon is literally worst case scenario for wind shear and nasausaf are going to have to lighten up cloudstorm restrictions if spacex wants to launch large volumes of these things from florida anyways
spacex,not_removed,apollo disagrees
spacex,not_removed,i keep saying that if i get an early ride to mars there would be good money in starting a distillery some wooden shipping crates and teaching myself coopering heh and now i can charge way to much for martian whiskey
spacex,not_removed,is it i grew up reading them in english read them all and thought they were french edit apparently the writer is belgian but they were written in french
spacex,not_removed,hergé is i think he meant that the comic is written in french
spacex,not_removed,many boats have electric winches which readily take a handle for manual use if you have power issues reaching for a handle on the cargo bay wall is preferable to macguyvering the winch
spacex,not_removed,hell even imaging the site while he was lying there motionless combined with loss of signal would be enough to jump to the hes dead conclusion too
spacex,not_removed,iirc nasa didnt image columbia after the foam strike
spacex,not_removed,hes the face of the company and hes more lead engineer cto than ceo but yes many its features might have been the ideas of other people in the team
spacex,not_removed,i suppose there are some criticism to be had about the personality cult that peoplewei have for musk but generally spacex and the space industry stand to benefit from the way people regard musk as an iconic oneman pioneer for example it offers an easier narrative to communicate to others à la steve jobs with apple people trust iconic leaders more than ambitious companies musk makes spacex look more stable because it can sound like he is involved at every level of detail and committed to seeing this all through a further unappreciated benefit is that musk frees the engineers and team members at spacex from risking their reputations by directing criticism and blame to musk himself instead of the hardworking staff
spacex,not_removed,okay a center cluster of engines
spacex,not_removed,good point i get the feeling that spacex does some redundancy not nowhere near like nasa tends to do
spacex,not_removed,i cannot imagine fitting more than six space suited people into a wire cage that could handle the largest expected cargo item to unload gravity is so not the same risk of crushing people but still unpleasant and dangerous in terms of suit rips if it happened i suspect the cables will be more like climbing ropes than steel hawsers to minimise the risk of snagging on a suit they have huge reliability and i am not seeing an accident as at all likely
spacex,not_removed,come on brave little rover another years and you can roll up ict ramp and come back on earth now that would be an awesome museum piece
spacex,not_removed,with people on site maintenance should be also possible
spacex,not_removed,youre probably thinking of one of the other issueslike how if he had actually done the hydrazine reduction sequence as he had over the time period he describes in the book it would have completely cooked the inside of the hab up to like degrees i remember him saying something along the lines of if id known that i would have done something else or made the sequence take more time or dealt with the heat somehow the other item i remember him talking about not having researched was the lithium scrubbers turns out all you need to do to make them reusable is to bake them at about degrees he could have changed how he handled several things as a result but ultimately its more important that the book is selfconsistent rather than scientifically accurate loved that book
spacex,not_removed,that seems like an unlikely oversight because that would render the entire experiment completely worthless
spacex,not_removed,i could easily see a robot arm in the cargo section which serves double duty as the crane boom on mars and is left behind when the ship departs back to earth there is no reason to carry the arm back to earth a multiaxis computer controlled manipulating robot would be worth its weight in gold to a team of colonists
spacex,not_removed,another bonus is this would be a way to get canada involved another international partner another one to share costs and therefore another one to get crew aboard
spacex,not_removed,i wouldnt want to use a flight suit for any deliberate trips into vacuum flight suits are an emergency measure a way to survive if the capsule suddenly depressurized its not designed for more than minimal mobility and comfort if youre planning on moving crates around youll want a proper eva suit you dont need a jetpack or a sunshade inside the cargo bay though and you dont need to be careful about always being clipped to something but its still nowhere near as casual as say leaving the house during a blizzard
spacex,not_removed,why wouldnt they have that problem
spacex,not_removed,a better glove would have allowed them to save the ladder i think
spacex,not_removed,comfortably newtonian
spacex,not_removed,on titan you could just flap your arms and fly down
spacex,not_removed,vacuum nozzles would be no good on titan for one thing although maybe the smaller ones alone on the its would do the job given the smaller gravity well
spacex,not_removed,see second response terminal velocity on titan is survivable you only fall at about ms mph kmhr
spacex,not_removed,colony on venus is theoretically possible if built to float above the surface like a blimp or something along those lines landing and taking off a whole different level of challenge though
spacex,not_removed,its not known whether the core is solid or liquid i would wager that there is a solid core with a liquid core around it
spacex,not_removed,elon doesnt seem to have a step between billion dollar rocket and landing an unmanned dragon on mars i dont get it should we not have fh launches that send scientists and engineers in small martian houses to build the foundation elon talked about he is just building the railroad ok elon you need a train station depot to arrive at the people will build the city around that who will build the depot elon right now shrugs this was supposed to be what elon thought about nonstop for years and this is it elons rocket ten years away i will be in my and he will pay for it with underpants nice
spacex,not_removed,is nasausaf the ones imposing weather restrictions i figured it was the launch providers themselves favoring relatively weak but lighter designs nasa doesnt seem to mind russia launching our astronauts in blizzards
spacex,not_removed,weather was acceptable it just got hit by lightning
spacex,not_removed,once agriculture is properly established yeah thats fine for the first several yearsdecades i imagine it will be a constant hustle to make sure theres enough food let alone having enough grains leftover to make whiskey
spacex,not_removed,french is a primary language in belgium lots of people speak it understandable though
spacex,not_removed,an electric motor shouldnt jam short of redicuslously poor manufacturing it just looses power so could be handwinched and its not to complex to design a mechanism to prevent uncontrolled falls
spacex,not_removed,true also that should really go to show how unlikely it is that a the motors that run those cranes are going to have issues considering boats that are constantly being hammered by salty sea spray and other nasty stuff still have a good reliability factor
spacex,not_removed,this would have worked they would image him and think hes dead then later they would do another image pass be surprised he was gone initially theyed think his body had been covered up but then they notice moved rovers and tents and they realize oh shit
spacex,not_removed,wasnt that despite engineers requests to actually do that
spacex,not_removed,iirc the reason was that there was anyway not really anything that could be done so it was better to just continue the mission and hope for the best
spacex,not_removed,relevant
spacex,not_removed,i think the other one was that watney would have needed to wash the soil to remove perchlorates but those findings may have been released after the book was finished
spacex,not_removed,turns out all you need to do to make them reusable is to bake them at about degrees this was one fact that i knew since i was i remember reading a book about the space station and how that was how they cleaned the lithium hydroxide filters for some reason the only things that stuck with me from that book were that fact about the filters and the fact that astronauts ate food through tubes
spacex,not_removed,is a reddit thread discussing exactly this it seems like martian soil simulant does not contain accurate levels of perchlorates and skimming a few news stories about growing crops in simulant i see no mention of adding perchlorates i do not see it as an unlikely oversight because perchlorates are relatively easy to wash out of the soil if you added accurate levels the first step would be to wash the soil to remove them
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,the percolates werent known about until recently
spacex,not_removed,perhaps on the earth the iss arms are unable to lift their own weight even though they are capable of hefty loads in space
spacex,not_removed,would you need to attach another one to the ship for the second voyage then what if they need help with eva on the return voyage just doesnt make much sense to leave it behind if the colonist want one then just pack one up and put it in the cargo hold no reason to sacrifice a piece of the ship to them also i am not sure how well something like the canadaarm would do on mars its designed to work in vacuum but it could be fine mars is not exactly that far from vacuum anyway making it also be the crane arm is a good idea though
spacex,not_removed,the new suits will be easier to move in and much lighter than the apollo suits
spacex,not_removed,while dying
spacex,not_removed,the smaller ones would do fine you would lose efficiency from not having ideal expansion ratios for titan but thats already true for use on mars they are earth sea level optimized yet suited for mars landing at near vacuum titan is an odd body with such a dense atmosphere but very low gravity it has less than a third the gravity as mars despite being about the same size the small engines would be more than enough for landing if they work for mars in fact the hard part would be the hoverslam with how much less the vehicle weighs at titan
spacex,not_removed,youre being irrational and unreasonable yes the depot needs to be dropped off first hence why elon has said before the first mission is roboticunmanned only drop off the reactor and other supplies mainly power for the reactor manned ship doesnt leave earth until reactor is successfully generating fuel just because elon didnt get into the specifics of the rest of the system doesnt mean he is planning on throwing ships at mars without those elements accounted for his presentation was to leave the endeavor open to partnerships which is very smart nasa and other private groups have more experience with sabatier processes on spacecraft if another entity is going to step up and create the depot why should spacex insource that part same goes for habitats those are pieces of the puzzle that can be solved be groups with that specific expertise already spacex is a rocket and spacecraft company what did you think they were planning to build elon has more plans on how to pay for it than he showed in the slide a press member asked in the private qa afterwards about the internet satellite constellation and elon said yes that is a possible funding source but now isnt the time to talk about it i also believe elon is playing the politics to set nasa up to be able to partner with spacex nasa would love to go to mars and have someone else develop the rocket and spacecraft they are also hamstrung by american politics and congressional funding
spacex,not_removed,how many falcon heavy launches will that take do you reckon
spacex,not_removed,still landing that unmanned dragon is in the hundreds of millions range thats only a order of magnitude difference from the first version of its
spacex,not_removed,have faith in elon young man
spacex,not_removed,all rockets are different the rocket design sets the weather limits is susceptible to crosswind limits when the rocket is a certain velocity and generally more vulnerable than others lightning oth is more universal and we know what happened to the shuttle in the cold weather that however was unique to that craft
spacex,not_removed,i wouldnt count on it having to be all that far down the road food and industrial waste has definite potential for straight ethanol production making it palatable is the real trick true whiskey is a long road for a lot of reasons but something vaguely resembling it
spacex,not_removed,french is one of two primary languages in belgium which was the country of european comics books
spacex,not_removed,redicuslously
spacex,not_removed,its been a few years but my recollection is that nro offered to do the imaging and nasa declined i dont recall if the engineers wanted it but i dont see why they wouldnt not sure there was a contingency plan that would have helped even if they saw the damage
spacex,not_removed,there is one mention of that in the caib report though there is a more pervasive feeling that it isnt a real problem as part of the caib nasa did a study on whether they could have launched atlantis in time to rescue the columbia astronauts and decided that it was feasible though the timelines were tight
spacex,not_removed,i always find that particular strip somewhat sad
spacex,not_removed,depends on which report it was known for a long time there were perchlorates on mars but it was not known until a year or two after the book was first finished it was originally released online as a serial chapter by chapter that it was a lot of perchlorate and that it was literally everywhere
spacex,not_removed,that finding was release right around the same time as the movie
spacex,not_removed,ah i see thanks for the link
spacex,not_removed,you are correct it would have to be overbuilt with respect to zero g tasks i picture it more as a martian manipulator robot pulling double duty while in space
spacex,not_removed,a good point on the return voyage i would argue that in elons ideal situation the ship is going back without any passengers and stripped of everything useful on mar which isnt required for a safe return trip including whatever crane system is used robot arms interior nonstructural cabin partitions led cabin light fixtures computer terminals kitchen sinks all these things would be priceless to colonists on mars and represent mass which has to get launched all the way from mars to orbit and back to earth regardless of how efficient the isru refueling system is methane and oxygen will be more valuable to colonists on the ground than the refurbishment cost of replacing everything not bolted down and required for a flight home
spacex,not_removed,the suits might be lighter or maybe not have you seen some of nasas next generation surface exploration suit designs they are more manturtle shaped robots you get inside of than any kind of lightweight piece of clothing for climbing ropes i think you might be thinking of the suits spacex is designing for commercial crew which are strictly for wearing inside a ship when there is a risk of decompression to get a suit for the martian surface you would have to add at least a couple layers to what they have been teasing plus add a life support backpack i dont think even spacex optimized suits will weigh less on mars than the nasa suits did on the moon
spacex,not_removed,definitely bring a warm coat
spacex,not_removed,another reason to use the sl engines on mars is that the vacuum engines cant run when the fuel is low because of the location of fuel inlets not sure if its methane or lox
spacex,not_removed,send up dragons connect them together to create living space like this then tether the to the other induce spin the tether will need to be big enough of a diameter to transport cargo and crew through so a y joint will need to be created for this so a day journey of people going to mars with artificial gravity i say launches of fh to get them up there loaded and spinning towards mars and mars direct launch that lands supplies at landing site by the time the crew is arriving on mars be prepping another martian cargo long shot because you dont have to wait for martian rendezvous when you are throwing up caro just through it up to leo and send it to mars regardless if it takes years to arrive nobody cares it is on its way and it got up there which is the most important thing
spacex,not_removed,didnt the nro image the columbia during though admittedly that was a test flight and there were concerns about tile damage simply because it was a new vehicle was well into the program and frankly there wasnt a whole lot of concern about the tile issues like there was with if the nro offered but was declined with that would really be a sad statement to say about nasa
spacex,not_removed,maybe feasible but quite risky afaik they would have to skip several steps in the preparation of the orbiter further increasing the risk for the other crew etc then there was the issue of transferring the crew over etc
spacex,not_removed,thats going to make colonization so easy a perchlorate ion exothermically decomposes into a chloride ion and oxygen gas so instead of generating oxygen through electrolysis we can just bake martian soil
spacex,not_removed,sure me i say leave the robot arm in the space ship and on the martian surface just leave a real crane theyll be sending construction equipment after all and the crane may need to be sent in multiple pieces but that fits with their mo
spacex,not_removed,do we have any idea on the average length of the return voyage because i think at least a skeleton crew will be left aboard the captain and what not sure you could automate the whole thing but people like it beter when multmillionbillion dollar spacecraft have a human on board running things as as someone who writes code and troubleshoots code i agree with them code is a terrible captian to have in charge when stuff goes wrong and if people can take a return trip and there is a dedicated crew then the return voyage will not be stripped down rather most of the cargo will be removed and there will be some mars earth cargo to replace it and less people on average but i would hope even a fully loaded its can make it home if needed if need be a similar refuel in orbit situation could be put in place on mars by sending a tanker its to mars and connect it to the isru again if the colonist need methane and lox as well then send two irsu units dont cannibalize the lifeline to earth if we are really serious about a martian colony then we need to think scale being efficient is important but in order for this to work a lot of stuff is going to be sent to the red planet its not about scraping out every useful kg of cargo though that is encouraged its about setting up a city on another planet now the first mission will probably be a flag planting rock taking and general test mission and on that one yeah they probably have much less cargo on the return trip they will need to measure exactly how much mars rocks and dust to send back it will all be very tight windows but after the system works just send a few tanker its with the next fleet in the next window and use them to refuel heavy return trips if needed it pretty neat modular system actually
spacex,not_removed,good point i would expect that of the initial fleet a good number of ships would just be staying permanently eventually they get parted up as scrap to build new things on site although i guess the carbon fiber tanks which make up a lot of the mass wont be that easy to reuse who knows maybe im wrong i dont know much about cf reuse im thinking the flight back might be pretty sparse and boring
spacex,not_removed,i would argue that in elons ideal situation the ship is going back without any passengers and stripped of everything useful on mar which isnt required for a safe return trip including whatever crane system is used see i see it as more the airline model it would fly with a small crew and even initially i am thinking it returns with the number of people it left with i can see a fairly sizeable portion of the marspeople not planning on being colonists but rather researchers scientists entrepreneurs etc that go for a stint then return to earth and maybe make another trip later in life i am also seeing a pretty big spaceship that suddenly with full reuse makes leo or tourism possible all while being large enough to be a space station in its own right
spacex,not_removed,wouldnt the suits still work just fine on planet where theres at least earth atmosphere vs full vacuum
spacex,not_removed,i assume this is inside information
spacex,not_removed,thats a good point but that is a product of the spacecraft design using only those engines for landings no reason to have plumbing for those last percentages of fuel for the vacuum only engines
spacex,not_removed,thats not enough space there isnt enough volume inside for food and life support
spacex,not_removed,yep its just that easy thank god we have you here to tell us what you think off the top of your head spacex should be doing sure you ignore how artificial gravity works and how fast the dragons would need to spin and sure you ignore the lack of living space storage space and transfer stage sure you ignore why we wait for martian rendezvous by which i assume you mean a launch window but other than that this is a really good idea
spacex,not_removed,i went back and read the caib report basically the columbia incident followed the same pattern as the challenger one nasa ignored a chronic issue because it hadnt caused serious issues and convinced themselves that it would never be serious the debris management team requested imagery on separate occasions management quashed all requests
spacex,not_removed,i dont know the details because the caib only talks in general details but if things went well they could have had on orbit in which to do the rescue and yes the on orbit part would have been risky
spacex,not_removed,yep its useful stuff energy intensive but worth it you get oxygen and chlorine the chlorine will be useful for treating waste water as well as calcium important nutrient from the calcium perchlorate yiu also get to extract tons of water on top of being percent perchlorate martian soil is up to water by volume so you bake the soil to break down perchlorate s and evaporate the water then you capture the water vapor in a still and turn it back into liquid water and oxen just add heat and probably a ridiculously complicated filtration and separation system to keep all the other crap in the soil separate
spacex,not_removed,i agree canadarm and such are optimized for space if you start thinking about the forces the joints would have to be able to handle in gravity it makes a lot more sense to use cranes winches and levers
spacex,not_removed,i think if the mars leg launches at the ideal time the return leg will be at least a few months longer with respect to having a crew onboard for the return leg i would agree i was trying to make a point about reuse but it came across like i wanted to strip the entire interior down to bare aluminum i will however say that removing as much weight as possible from the lander makes sense i dont picture it as salvaging as much as designing the interior from the beginning to be reused on mars as an example the ship cabin will have lots of lights whatever shelter the colonists bring they will need lights why should you carry a separate light when instead they could use a light from the cabin that light will need a power cord and the power cord in the cabin is useless now so why not use that if you remove the light from a particular section of the cabin it isnt very useful anymore so why not take down the walls and open it up the main space if the interior parts of the ship used by the colonists were designed to be easily disassembled then the colonists could be left with useful material on mars
spacex,not_removed,well the flight back is free cant complain about the lack of toilets and sinks
spacex,not_removed,carbon fiber tanks could become highvolume structures on the surface of mars or simply tanks for and generated by the isru plants i mean it sort of makes sense afterall to just make one of these its vessels with a huge isru plant that pumps the output into the tanks would be all the right hardware to transfer to the peoplecarrying one oh and that would also provide a stockpile of raptors that could be scavenged for parts in case of needed repairs
spacex,not_removed,i think you are probably right that the airline model is probably more realistic than my idea of stripping the ship down but consider this airline interiors get pretty heavily overhauled every months because of damage and wear caused by passengers how much refurbishment will be required on a ship where the passengers live inside for monthsround trip minimum i would expect the interior to get an overhaul during its inspection on earth between flights anyway so something like molded plastic interior panels or nonessential low voltage power and data cables seem like ideal things to leave behind on mars replacing them would cost pennies on earth but processed plastics and prefabricated electrical wires will be extremely valuable if an airline flew somewhere where they could sell used airline seats for what they paid for them new back home and the return trip was only full you can bet they would give the stewardesses wrenches and seats would be getting unbolted before the cargo hold was done being unloaded
spacex,not_removed,atmosphere is the same as vacuum for space suit purposes
spacex,not_removed,they would work fine for protecting your body from the vacuum but they would need insulation some level of radiation protection an cleanable abrasion resistant outer layer the list goes on
spacex,not_removed,its fairly obvious in the cutaway the end of the tank is conical and only the sl engines appear to be connected to the end of the cone
spacex,not_removed,no its pretty obvious from the cutaway view of the lander
spacex,not_removed,that sounds like an exaggeration people per dragon means of pressurized volume per person of dry food will last you around years of water gallons should be enough if you have good recycling im not sure how big your water and air recyclers needs to be seems extremely unpleasant but possible to me
spacex,not_removed,eva install external tanks i mean do we want to be on mars or not
spacex,not_removed,no i knew all of that stuff that you mentioned already do you want new ideas in the space industry or not notice i said we dont care about your launch window for cargo direct mars shots which would not be the eva construction launches in preparation to go to mars spacex could send up a private spaceport on the fh to facilitate leo construction nothing about my idea is undoable and it is cheaper than billion dollars by a huge margin do you want to get to mars the tether between the dragons would need to be of large diameter it would allow crew to pass through and would allow large amounts of storage you could install water tanks on the outside of the tether to create your shielded radiation room mars insertion burn then you deconstruct your nownonspinning dragons into only the dragons with crew members and enough fuel to use the superdracos to descend i just saved spacex billion and i think what your looking for to determine rotation for g would be g x r i never learned how to do equations in ascii
spacex,not_removed,i get simply angry the more that i read about the columbia breakup the systemic failures in the nasa management that caused the challenger disaster didnt seem to get fixed and frankly still exist within nasa then again i think it is a good thing that nasa is getting out of the game of owning spaceships of its own sort of the reason i advocate the shut down of sls orion as an agency they really arent suited to be a transportation service
spacex,not_removed,so he could use the hydrazine reaction to decompose the percholrate and the heat to clean the lithium scrubbers
spacex,not_removed,yiu also get to extract tons of water i was expecting a link to a chinese research paper and then it clicked also the chlorine will be useful for treating waste water solid fuel manufacturing perhaps too
spacex,not_removed,i see your point i guess it depends on how modular the crew area is they could design it such a way that dismantling it every landing on mars and only setting up what was needed for any earthers wanter a trip home but if they design it so dismantling the crew area becomes impractical then they would just deal with the extra weight so it really depends on how the crew area is designed on a different note how cool is it that people who work on these ships as flight crew will have jobs that are in space ship not astronauts but just people who work in space on a space ship sailing the endless black thats a scifi story becoming reality
spacex,not_removed,this does become a game of tradeoffs though in an effort to make everything dual purpose you can end up with a lot of items that are heavier and unoptimized for both purposes
spacex,not_removed,its free but there is only steerage class oh well many of my ancestors have dealt with it
spacex,not_removed,do you want new ideas in the space industry or not no i want good ideas and no you cant just ship off a cargo mission whenever the hell you feel like it as i said you clearly dont understand the reasoning for launch windows its not because it makes travel faster its because it uses less dv and launch a private spaceport into orbit what the bloody hell are you talking about this isnt scifi you dont just send up a spaceport and then construct stuff in leo do you want to get to mars yes which is why i choose to support ideas that will actually get us there mars insertion burn holy shit do you know how much dv that would cost there is a reason only satellites do insertion burns also how do you propose these astronauts get back just leave em there on the surface to die if something goes wrong just have em live the rest of their lives out in dragons i just saved spacex billion holy fucking shit dude just stop
spacex,not_removed,spacex wants to colonize mars its not possible if youre sending crew on a billion mission
spacex,not_removed,when it happened i thought that it was a fluke and that there was nothing they could have done then i read the report and realized it was precisely the same problem as challenger there was an ongoing problem but instead of stopping and fixing it they decided that since it hadnt caused a serious problem yet it wasnt a real issue i have a hard time not getting angry as well
spacex,not_removed,the perspective in this photo makes the rocket look a lot smaller
spacex,not_removed,heres another shot of garrett with the space operations team slightly overshadowed by httpstwittercomastrogdogglangengb
spacex,not_removed,link to the photo
spacex,not_removed,this is interesting is a people team small or average for space operations can they scale to multiple flights at the same time
spacex,not_removed,would now be a good time to go and check it out it looks like they still have the green fence around the rocket
spacex,not_removed,i sort of love that spacex is not advertising the fact that this display is technically comprised of two successfullyrecovered stages also sort of curious as to what transpired with original legs and why legs were transplanted
spacex,not_removed,someone with a tilt shift lens needs to get out there already
spacex,not_removed,if you append orig to the end of that link youll get the full size image
spacex,not_removed,they just started putting up the glass wall on friday so you may want to wait a week
spacex,not_removed,legs couldve been deemed flight worthy and the opposite this makes even more sense considering soft touchdown and crush core incident
spacex,not_removed,i love that fact about twitter i was going to do it but i forgot thanks
spacex,not_removed,definitely believable
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,with nrol activities at the cape spacex wont have the range available to do a static fire and launch in their original timeframe theres now a two week delay the has impacted spacexs original campaign
spacex,not_removed,httpiimgurcomznpmebojpg credit
spacex,not_removed,as a cylindrical rocket gets larger the mass goes up by the cube but the surface area of the bottom where the engines are goes up by the square aerodynamics wants longer and thinner rather than shorter and squatter i wonder at what point will the mass of the rocket becomes larger than the ability to pump and burn oxidizer and fuel through the proportionally smaller space at the bottom happen of course rockets can get considerably larger than they are now bigger than saturn v but at some point that ratio will prevent simple cylinder shaped rockets from getting any larger
spacex,not_removed,cna you add a rough in there
spacex,not_removed,it always bothered me that this render cuts off instead of showing the height its hard to get a sense of scale when you only show a small part of one of the rockets
spacex,not_removed,any idea how this was made is this something i could load into and walk around it in the vive i really want to do that i bet he could even make a couple bucks selling this in the steam store
spacex,not_removed,looking at this im not sure why they think this is a good idea i get that the economies of scale could work for but how can they possibly launch enough of those things for the economics to make sense remember nasa basically went dormant because the saturn v was too big
spacex,not_removed,how many kilotons is that equivalent too
spacex,not_removed,print this at the launch sight
spacex,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commentbig fu falcon rocket used in this commentlow earth orbit decronym is a community product of rspacex implemented im a bot and i first saw this thread at jul utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
spacex,not_removed,nothing dictates it has to stay a cylinder look at how russians build rockets
spacex,not_removed,perhaps would like to do us some more renders i enjoyed this one regardless of the cutoff but perhaps to satiate others
spacex,not_removed,this was made with max and photoshop i started with a photograph of the on the pad at vandenberg and based on the known dimensions was able to approximate its position within the image then i added the bfr in based on the rumored dimensions and tried to match the natural lighting of the sunrise i used photoshop to touch up a few things like noise and blurring im also really into vr and would love to make a demo where you can walk around the dragon and bfr vr would offer an amazing sense of scale i have a vive and im pretty proficient in unity but im not very good at modeling at some point ill try to find models and set something like that up ill probably wait for the official bfr reveal first
spacex,not_removed,i assume multiple launches per trip to mars starting in launches maybe months before the window opens to get the hardware and fuel up there earth orbit couple of dragon launches to get people up there one more bfr for the crew then off to mars in between mars windows you could launch large or collated payloads then theres the saying if you build it they will come edit ive read somewhere bfr would be more efficient than as well edit strikethrough
spacex,not_removed,each mars launch will require or bfr missions theyve talked about wanting to do dozens of flights each window so thats at least or so launches every months in reality all of those at least until they build up actual fuel depots will have to be within a span of a month or so the rest of the cycle can be filled up with leo flights a spacecraft big enough to carry people to mars should be able to carry at least as many tourists to orbit or it could be used as sort of a landable space station for scientific flights and perhaps lunar missions or other targets as elon suggested would be a possibility provided a paying customer if the priceperticket they claim ends up being at least within an order of magnitude of reality a single bfr launch should be about as expensive as is now made possible by full reuse and cheaper fuel and easier refurbishment of methalox engines
spacex,not_removed,saturn was also billion dollars per launch in todays money thats because they threw the thing away each time after using it just once if it wasnt so expensive there would not have been a reason to stop flying it
spacex,not_removed,fully reusable system from the start was an expendable rocket first that was then given training wheels they wont ever pump these rockets off an assembly line like they do for falcons or other traditional rockets in addition to that spacex has been focusing for over a decade now on cheaper manufacturing processes a rocket doesnt fundamentally have to cost as much as a saturn v for something in this class if this werent fully reusable then youd be right the costs would be unmanageable the whole point of this scale is that to break through into a fully reusable system you have to be ready to go bigger
spacex,not_removed,speculated to be
spacex,not_removed,thats the same image i linked
spacex,not_removed,absolutely thats exactly why i said simple cylinder shaped all the unofficial renderings of this new generation of bfr assumes a gigantic cylinder and my point is that this may not be what they are going for at all
spacex,not_removed,yeah i figured that much but even just a blank cylinder with a range at the top showing the approximate minmax height from the estimates people have calculated here would be nice
spacex,not_removed,thanks for the reply so the format its in now isnt something you can import into unity i also came across this software httpswwwirisvrcomdownloads that lets you import revit sketchup or obj files and view them directly in the vive would that help i started trying to make a really simple model in sketchup to load into the vive but alas even a big cylinder was beyond me ill have to do a tutorial later
spacex,not_removed,no dragon launches based on the price theyve estinated a single launch would be about twice the price of the entire campaign and theyd need dragons to carry up people definitely not feasible
spacex,not_removed,ah shit saw it and thought it was the first props for you
spacex,not_removed,i could definitely import what i have into unity but the model quality is so basic that i could probably just recreate it with the unity primitives i would much rather have really nice detailed models which would help with realism and immersion one of my favorite vr experience so far has been the apollo demo it would be awesome to recreate that where you can sit in the dragon cockpit during a launch to the iss
spacex,not_removed,oops how silly of me of course the crew will go up on bfrs
spacex,not_removed,this post was taken down anyway
spacex,not_removed,great idea perhaps a kickstarter is in order

spacex,not_removed,oh damn i was about to post about how this was music to my ears because i thought by french you mean cnes or esa somehow meaning itsenabled moon village plan or something
spacex,not_removed,i do not think this is necessarily about spacex spacex red dragon is being used as the example but this seems to be a broader invitation to any interested party i do not think spacex would actually be an interested party here as they are not interested in doing anything at the moon except at the behest of a paying customer maybe its testing though
spacex,not_removed,im assuming these missions will also incoperate returning and reusing the vehicle so the price lowers over time its so great that organizations are seeing spacex as a highly capable company

spacex,not_removed,office of commercial space transportation commercial space transportation advisory committee httpwwwfaagovaboutofficeorgheadquartersofficesastadvisorycommittee comstac was established in to provide information advice and recommendations to the administrator of the federal aviation administration faa on critical matters concerning the us commercial space transportation industry the economic technical and institutional expertise provided by comstac members has been invaluable to our work in developing effective regulations that ensure safety during commercial launch operations and policies that support international competitiveness for the industry the meeting agenda is listed and live webcast is supposed to be httpfaacapitolconnectionorg the us government is required by law and international treaty to oversee the activities of us companiesorganizations including spacex to make sure that they comply with international treaty there isnt a single agency charged with this duty so far the faa has had a large part of the responsibility and nasa has also been involved note nasa participants at the meeting so things discussed at this meeting are very important to the future of spacex for example the activities of nasas nac httpssciencenasagovsciencecommitteesubcommitteesnacplanetaryprotectionsubcommittee will presumably relate to the approval process for putting hardware and ultimately humans on mars and for bringing things back from mars so far the agencies involved in the approval process have been very supportive of commercial space the comments from the meeting tweeted by jeff foust give an encouraging indication that this continues to be the case
spacex,not_removed,two falcon heavy launches provides a leo mass that is comparable to apollo i think many governments would be enthused about the prospect of a cheap manned moon mission
spacex,not_removed,i read it as a broader statement of receptiveness to similar collaborations where industry takes the initiative and nasa provides support in exchange for knowledge within the cislunar arena between the surfaces of earth and the moon so for example it could be taken as a nudge towards the likes of ula effectively saying put your money where your mouth is regarding i think what industry has seemingly failed to learn over the years is that if you have a concept that youre excited about you should initiate it yourself not wait for nasa or other government agency to contract you to do it because the lawmakers who control nasa will not spring for a singlesource architecture unless its already in motion thats the fundamental difference with spacex i think they say build it and they will come traditional space industry says design it and maybe they will come and pay for it thankfully i feel the wind changing in this regard utorybruno am i wrong here
spacex,not_removed,am i the only one or did many other people think this was about the french space program contracting for a falcon heavyred dragon launch to the moon
spacex,not_removed,me too so sad now we are stuck with our ariane
spacex,not_removed,i got incredibly excited for a whopping seconds
spacex,not_removed,yeah i thought the same thing for a moment it would be quite surprising since i think cnes is pretty fan of mars and not so much of the moon
spacex,not_removed,spacex is a private contractor if they successfully demonstrate a relatively inexpensive architecture capable of softlanding several tons of hardware on any atmospherefree body in the solar system somebody will pay them to do it and they will take that money because how else will they raise funds for the its
spacex,not_removed,thats a big ask it would need about to land which is already a stretch requiring lots of extra propellant a return mission would need twice that much dv a dedicated reusable lander with around dv makes more sense in this context probably an acesxeus system will happen before a spacex lunar landing mission with a reusable vehicle preferably this would be something with a heatshield for returntosurface rather than an upper stage that would have to dock and do both cargo and propellant transfers for reuse
spacex,not_removed,err how does the fh remotely have a payload capacity comparable to the mighty saturn v
spacex,not_removed,kind of just because you are a private company that makes investments does not mean there are not also usg investments this looks like it might be a reference to space act act agreements this is a program where a private company proposes an activity and asks nasa to collaborate if nasa is interested then the company pays for what they do while nasa pays for what it does ie byom bring your own money it is a way of tapping nasa expertise and lessening the economic burden for a private company to develop a capability by getting part of the work performed and paid for directly by nasa these are especially attractive if the nasa work is something nasa is already facilitized for and really good at otherwise the company has to do and pay for all of it i have a very modest one for the cryote testing we are doing to demonstrate on orbit fuel transfer technologies because nasa has some very unique testing facilities that would be difficult for us to recreate ive heard that space x has one on dragonred dragon
spacex,not_removed,from the same tweet series french working for the next two months to followon to rfi for comml iss module trade space is wide open it seems to me that nasa is attempting to apply the commercial crewcargo model to more stuff it starts with iss modules and maybe some lunar stuff later this seems like a great direction
spacex,not_removed,i agree the statement seems more to imply nasa support towards industry led activities in general rather than being spacex specific
spacex,not_removed,beautifully said
spacex,not_removed,ariane is not a bad rocket nothing spectacular either but its decent
spacex,not_removed,isnt ariane super super reliable though so at least theres that
spacex,not_removed,the ariane is an improvement compared to the ariane but i do worry it might struggle against a partially reusable falcon i dont see adeline giving the necessary cost savings to duke it out headtohead with a falcon that said arianespace holds the lions share of the global launch market right now ill wait and see before i consider them doomed
spacex,not_removed,well i was really thinking esa france having heavy influence there but i said cnes because theyre a french company iirc and that made my initial excitement seem more rational that said whats this about cnes and mars
spacex,not_removed,but they are very unlikely to develop any such system except as an incidental byproduct of testing mars equipment doing anything new like that would require resources mainly time that they want to focus exclusively on mars
spacex,not_removed,i read cislunar space activities as inorbit missions we will see what they mean soon
spacex,not_removed,hes got a point only if hes talking purely about payload capacity in an academic sense the eventual and theoretical leo payload of falcon heavy which is comparable to saturn vs capability however you cant make use of that payload capacity without expending all six cores nor does the payload fairing allow you to fit of anything but lead ingots
spacex,not_removed,thanks for the detailed and honest response i knew i was oversimplifying things so i was a little apprehensive asking you for comment but as always youre a safe bet
spacex,not_removed,i have a very modest one for the cryote testing we are doing to demonstrate on orbit fuel transfer technologies because nasa has some very unique testing facilities that would be difficult for us to recreate could you foresee a situation where you might collaborate on this kind of work with spacex for their its orbital refuelling development
spacex,not_removed,it has taken me a little while to collect my thoughts i still get a little star struck when a rocket company ceo talks to me so yes while many of spacexs accomplishments so far have been enabled andor mandated by contacts stuff like their first stage landing experiments the red dragon missions but not the capsules and the nascent its architecture ill call it its until spacex comes up with the new name are all development projects that theyve selfinitiated on proceeds from their other activities they do those things in the hopes of creating a valuable enough service be it cheaper launches regular cargo runs to mars surface or giant scifi spaceships to pay for itself perhaps im not observant enough but while ive seen plenty of really exciting concept architectures from plenty of companies ive never seen another space company actually initiate these sorts of bigticket projects on their own as a space fan that makes me very weary of exciting concept videos that just feel very clearly like a pitch at nasa the reality seems to be that unless a plan is super cheap but also calls for manufacturing in every state with a representative on the relevant committees it has no hope of happening unless the company can get the ball rolling on its own bend metal weave fibre test systems and demonstrate the value of the project in action to make it an irresistible valueformoney proposition for the lawmakers i suppose what my point boils down to is that spacex take insane but we presume calculated business risks in the name of progress and that this threads quote from mr french seems to indicate nasas desire for other companies to also take the lead take the risk initiate the cool stuff and theyll be there to offer support and logistics if the activity appeals to them it sidesteps the governmental sausage grinder and i have to believe nasa management would be allforthat thats the part in hoping im right about the commercialisation of iss expansion plays into that impression for me and im hoping nasa is communicating that stance even more clearly behind closed doors
spacex,not_removed,im going to go out here and defend the ariane family of rockets so far as they have been pretty much the only thing holding up commercial spaceflight ventures of any kind the bold leap of faith where the esa said essentially we dont trust that the space shuttle is going to reduce costs to the level you americans claim it will bring the sts never got to the price point of about that was asserted back in the nixon administration and with hindsight turns out that the saturn iv would have actually been cheaper you might more legitimately be critical of the ariane as perhaps being a bit too timid of a change with the gauntlet that spacex has laid down with the falcon and now the falcon heavy as well that the kind of performance that the esa will be getting out of the ariane compared to its predecessors isnt really all that much of an improvement in all other aspects though this is really an incredible rocket that is being developed for at least the traditional rocket industry as being very reasonable for costs as well as the kind of payloads it will be flying im calling it a spectacular rocket design following a really amazing series of rockets in the same family that unfortunately is just being completely outclassed by spacex it is no wonder that the executives at arianespace have been publicly accusing the us federal government of sending a whole bunch of black budget money stuff that doesnt show up in public documents as appropriations towards spacex if spacex fails miserably arianespace really is the organization to beat in the global launch provider market and the ariane is by far and away the next best rocket that is to compete against the falcon perhaps ula will get their act together as well but they are the gold standard for low cost commercial spaceflight a sad state of affairs in the global launch market to be sure but it is what it is right now
spacex,not_removed,yes i agree but still its a new rocket design without any idea or plan for recovery a new rocket that will be already outdated ariane was presented as a rocket that will compet with falcon yes falcon not falcon but wait and see
spacex,not_removed,ariane is at least yes remains to be seen on the ariane it will probably be just as reliable but who knows there may be bugs to work out just like in the initial ariane which went rud its first launch
spacex,not_removed,cnes is the french space agency dont take my word on it but i remember reading that cnes was more interested in mars than in the moon i may be entirely wrong though
spacex,not_removed,its a balancing act on the one hand the goal is to go to mars on the other hand they need income to do it if they make a system to go to mars that can also go other places with minimal effort that maximizes the potential for success i think a dragon that landing on the moon is not as unlikely as you might think because a system that can land both places is more likely to succeed than one that can only go to mars
spacex,not_removed,any time
spacex,not_removed,the aerospace industry has a long tradition of competitors cooperating in order to serve missions neither could do as effectively by themselves
spacex,not_removed,sure bigger question companies absolutely do look into the future make educated guesses about what will be needed and what can be possible then they make investments to create capabilities to service that future aces is a great example no one told us that ultra long duration on orbit reusability or distributed launch were requirements or needs we had our own vision about the broader possibilities of space and what these capabilities could enable now that we are on that path i am getting real excitement from the customer community validating the near part of my vision but it started here the nuanced difference between a traditional business like ula and some new entrants is that the story i just told has to conclude in profitability for a traditional business and those profits have to pay off the investment in a reasonable amount of time and that investment has to create more profits here than if it was spent in some other way an extreme example for illustrative purposes would be that every i invest in vulcanaces better make more money than just putting it in the bank and collecting interest while it has created initial and beneficial energy to have unconventional businesses toss these pedestrian concerns aside and plow ahead on grand ideas how long can that last years my personal commitment to space calls for long term sustained human and economic expansion beyond earth that will take staying power and institutional commitment which will require a sound economic foundation that can outlive my career and the careers of my industry peers this future requires more than my leadership or the leadership of any one person so the pedestrian economic drivers of a conventional business are really the concrete foundation that will sustain this vision beyond any one individual both kinds of businesses are playing a key role in this great journey
spacex,not_removed,nicely put i think you meant wary rather than weary ill just throw out some wording of my own spacex is a nontraditional company with little responsibility to shareholders and large possibly zero profit goals it is hard for traditional rocket organizations to take the risk of developing reusable rockets when the risks are high the market seems fixed and success may just result in lower revenue potential customers however can be very supportive of such efforts lower costs can increase demand
spacex,not_removed,as a general rule in aerospace when a company builds a major new product line like a new airliner they have not only done research to figure out if there is a market that can support the new airplane they also have a flagship customer or lined up that has agreed to order the first airplanes off the assembly line spacex had either an air force or a nasa contract to orbit the payload of their first falcon too bad it went into the drink they had the cots contract from nasa before they built the first falcon and dragon capsule the later upgrades to falcon have not been tied to any flagship customers so far as i know but falcon heavy has had customers signed up and waiting for flights long before it was built so part of spacex success compared to other new space companies has been based on following the kind of development path that boeing used when they built the first and that lockheed used when they built the and that airbus has used for all the airplanes they have made
spacex,not_removed,maybe its the same situation i say when defending sls its a good thing to have backups thats the reason why we want to go to mars after all
spacex,not_removed,maybe spacex will fail miserably but i dont think bo will fail
spacex,not_removed,if the reusability cant lower the price of launches then the ariane will be a competitive rocket you can call airbussafran risk averse but you cant say they are stupid
spacex,not_removed,yes i agree but still its a new rocket design without any idea or plan for recovery quite false the adeline concept is a thing and is under active development by airbus safran at the same time theyre also working a methane powered mainstage engine to replace vulcain both of those are in very early development but things are happening a new rocket that will be already outdated perhaps but just because it may not be the best doesnt mean it isnt better than what came before the ariane is not a bad design but its aging especially with its mid life upgrade cancelled
spacex,not_removed,esa subsidise arianespace pretty heavily so it will remain competitive
spacex,not_removed,i really wonder how much development work it will take to make a lunar dragon it would basically be a red dragon minus heat shield and plus bonus fuel tanks i would really love to see a dragon trunk kicker pack the extra fuel in the trunk with its own superdraco no modification needed inside the dragon itself and this could be useful for getting some more deltav out of red dragon to make recovering fh center core more realistic
spacex,not_removed,but that is the point a dragon is far from capable of landing on the moon if you want it to be able to land on the moon you need a lot of expensive changes that are not necessary to send a dragon to mars french is also not suggesting that nasa would pay for such an expedition in any case the choice of red dragon as his example partnership is very telling nasa is collaborating with spacex but not giving them a penny
spacex,not_removed,you are an inspiration thank you
spacex,not_removed,would be really neat if you could cooperate with bo and spacex to bring fuel and payloads up for aces in bulk a dozen or so payloads trucked up to the same orbit and then some of them are deployed some go to geo some move to other inclinations etc and then use aces to send them on to their final orbits eliminate the need to throw away most of a vulcan core for each flight and bulk delivery to leo should be cheaper plus aces should be able to move a significant amount of payload even between orbital inclinations something like tons of payload from a degree leo to polar orbit with sufficient margin to bring aces back to degrees on a single propellant load probably much better if using a bieliptic transfer or multiple propellant loads i think as the number of payloads flying increases and the number of those payloads going to to high energy orbits increases as well theres going to be demand for a service like this operating primarily as an inspace mover rather than actually getting the payloads into orbit aces is ideally suited for this sort of future but the vulcan core is pretty unambitious imo maybe ula could look at focusing on inspace transport
spacex,not_removed,since were discussing the cryotransfer tech have there been any feelers from either side about developing an open standard for fuel ports itd really future proof things if everyone is able to pump between everyone elses ports
spacex,not_removed,since both ula and spacex are already working on orbital cryogenic fuel transfer systems and can probably both handle the development individually what is an area that you see as currently too hardlow trl that would be a good area to team up with competing aerospace companies on thanks edit spacex fuel transfer development has not been confirmed to have been started yet
spacex,not_removed,has ula ever considered entering a nofundsexchanged contract with spacex in the same way spacex has with nasa it could certainly be beneficial to both companies
spacex,not_removed,magnificent answer thank you that really grounds my impressions of the industry as a whole naturally as a hopeless fanboy i hope youre wrong about newspace that they never lose this startup verve but i see how unrealistic that is regardless like you im glad about the shot in the arm that newspace is providing to humanitys push into space really great getting your views on this tory thanks again for answering my callout
spacex,not_removed,sounds exactly like the reasons why elon is in no rush to go public with spacex shareholders are generally not big on highriskhighrewardlongterm investments must be very limiting
spacex,not_removed,nicely put i think you meant wary rather than weary a little from column a a little from column b ill just throw out some wording of my own spacex is a nontraditional company with little responsibility to shareholders and large possibly zero profit goals excellent point spacexs ideological motivations are genuinely strong drivers of everything they do and while represents a pivot by ula to a much more ideologydriven outlook as tory pointed out it still needs to be clearly able to turn a profit in the short term for them having to answer to shareholders with no ideological engagement is a total pain there ought to be a bloc of rich space geeks who encourage traditional companies to indulge in nimble future thinking like this and reward them for it with huge investments kind of like incentivising a space faring future
spacex,not_removed,i dont dispute that the vast majority of spacexs progress has indeed been more or less a traditional aerospace progression but the specific projects i listed the ones that excite us the most have been selfdirected
spacex,not_removed,blue origin is being operated by a company which has financial backing from somebody who has far more money than elon musk has been around several years longer than spacex as a company and has yet to have a vehicle get above the karman line much less even into orbit spacex has already put stuff into gto and even earthsun lagrangian points with a scheduled trip unmanned to mars as much as i like the idea of competition and that perhaps jeff bezos might get off of his behind and take his play toy of a rocket company and turn it into something real so far im not really seeing all that much progress happening it would be nice if blue origin was in the same class as spacex ula and arianespace and some day they might at the moment it is really hard to say that with a straight face that they are even a competitor
spacex,not_removed,i think there is something to be said about a reliable rocket i would be sweeting bullets right now if the james webb space telescope was launching on a falcon i have no worries at all since it is launching on a ariane i fully expect falcon to get to an extremely reliable cadence however
spacex,not_removed,it will be competitive but its also a risk if ariane is wrong on reusability they will be about years behind spacex and other companies like blue origin given when ariane vi will be deployed versus development time of a reusable rocket
spacex,not_removed,if the reusability cant lower the price of launches or if spacex decides that undercutting everyone is sufficient its not like theyd have trouble spending their money
spacex,not_removed,you can call airbussafran risk averse only short term risk averse long term risk of losing your foothold when others innovate successfully is what you get instead spacex takes short term risk of rd with potential long term payoff ariane does the opposite
spacex,not_removed,if you run the numbers today ariane should be canceled they keep the project only with esa words to provide lauchyear at outrageous price comparing to priceor even spacex price french support half of the cost again not because they love space because ariane booster is derived from french icbm and they want to keep a solid booster industry in the country esa budget is a joke and they manage to make mistake after mistake about long term strategy i hope i really hope a change as a european space fan but inertia and httpsenwikipediaorgwikipathdependence are strond on this one same as ula so its not really eu oriented i guess
spacex,not_removed,it probably wont be competitive but its europes guaranteed access to space if for whatever reason the us it russia decides to pull the plug on european launch customers theyre done without a european launcher
spacex,not_removed,heavily do you have a source for that i didnt find anything up to date but i remember it was € a year a few years ago but it was almost down to zero for or the main subsidies would be the billions euros to develop ariane that is not in the price of the launch
spacex,not_removed,i am certain that spacex could make a lunar dragon if they wanted to it would not take a tremendous amount of development work though that is not to underestimate the engineering challenges involved with making these simple changes they are certainly capable of it however my main point is that they have no incentive to do so spacex is extremely mars focused designing and manufacturing lunar dragons does not help them get either hardware or funds to advance the mars mission it would be one thing if nasa were soliciting bids for commercial lunar transportation but they are not in fact nasa is being very explicit here that they are happy to provide expertise and guidance to anyone who wants to mount such an expedition but will not give any direct funding
spacex,not_removed,previous thoughts on extra fuel for propulsively landed capsules have involved tanks around the docking interface at the top the ida standard includes fuel transfer which can work either way so plumbing can connect to that and through to the capsule tanks a lunar dragon using that approach would need to either launch inside a fairing with the tanks already in place or an apollo style flip and dock
spacex,not_removed,what sort of changes would you expect to on a lunar dragon vs a red dragon
spacex,not_removed,do you have my office bugged
spacex,not_removed,aces is ideally suited for this sort of future but the vulcan core is pretty unambitious imo maybe ula could look at focusing on inspace transport i really think this is the plan that ula and utorybruno are banking on vulcan doesnt need to be the cheapest the most capable or have first stage reuse if they can make the plan with aces work vulcan serves for a select handful of missions that get aces into orbit and from there all these other companies can provide the fuel and even the payloads focusing their next gen launcher around the in space systems is a different approach that just might work if ula can stay a leader in spacecraft tech for aces that could keep them in the game for a new future in space more than a launcher could everything about aces can scale if someone can get the fuel in orbit cheap what gets developed for aces could fly on any number of platforms in the future not just vulcan i would love to see spacex have a tanker adapted to carry hydrogen in the extra tanks or as someone else pointed out a super aces fit for a bfr so far spacex doesnt seem inclined to build a traditional payload delivery stage for bfr so this would be a logical way to earn some extra launches without having to branch out too much
spacex,not_removed,fuel transfer standards are addons to the idss docking standard so far as i can gather so far this may only have been used for transfers to the iss from the esa and japanese cargo vehicles these would be transferring hydrazine and nto not lox and methane i can easily picture spacex adding a section to the idss saying something like the cm inside diameter methane fuel transfer port shall be located along the y axis below the human transfer port one or both sides of this connection shall be made by a robot extensible connector tentacle capable of finding and connecting to the opposing fuel port with total position errors not more than m in any direction the connector itself shall be androgynous employing hooks and orings to make the seal in a similar manner to the human transfer port the cm inside diameter lox transfer port shall be located along the y axis below the human transfer port one or both sides of this connection shall be made by a robot extensible connector tentacle capable of finding and connecting to the opposing fuel port with total position errors not more than m in any direction the connector itself shall be androgynous employing hooks and orings to make the seal in a similar manner to the human transfer port pumps supporting methane transfer shall be able to transfer up to cubic meters per hour pumps supporting lox transfer shall be able to transfer up to cubic meters per hour further documentation of mechanical stresses the ports and transfer tentacles are able to handle are given hers and assume that the its and tanker shall spin about a common axis at up to rpm this is considerably beyond anything that was envisioned when idss was proposed but it is all allowable under the standard
spacex,not_removed,wouldnt the only shared fuel connector be lox between most vehicles hydrogen and methane most likely requiring different specs isnt it usually beneficial for bleeding edge tech to be evolved by several parties before setting up standards
spacex,not_removed,is spacex working on that already
spacex,not_removed,naturally as a hopeless fanboy i hope youre wrong about newspace that they never lose this startup verve but i see how unrealistic that is best case they evolve into a new wave of old space as their goals are met and inspire new waves
spacex,not_removed,there ought to be a bloc of rich space geeks who encourage traditional companies to indulge in nimble future thinking like this well google put a into spacex last yearish then theres the xprize competitions
spacex,not_removed,thats not entirely fair bo has already broken ground on their full manufacturing facility in florida they are not a competitor yet but they have finally gotten serious about getting in the game the fact that bezos has way more money to throw at it if he wants to is an advantage for them bezos could fund out of pocket the entire its development and not break a sweat bo is definitely way behind for now but as the only other company taking vtvl seriously they could make up a lot of ground in a relatively short term
spacex,not_removed,blue origin has yet to have a vehicle get above the karman line dateapogee km nov jan apr jun id also like to point out that ula has a team of intelligent and experienced engineers with access to testing data who seem impressed with blue origins engine performance and rate of progress
spacex,not_removed,i love spacex as much as the next guy but thats not true they are doing things differently but they actually have more progress than spacex in certain areas they have actually reflown a rocket suborbital or not they are technically ahead in reuse technology they are going about the job different but their goals are the same they decided to go for reuse first since bezos has the deep pockets to keep the company afloat elon didnt have the luxury so he went for profit first and build a working rocket that could be adapted for reuse
spacex,not_removed,what is the reliable rocket thats better than a i doubt such as low accident rate is possible when dealing with outer space i too hope that reuse will lower the failure rate of rockets
spacex,not_removed,yep and if bo manage to make the ng there will be enough heavy launch providers ils sx ula bo and in years maybe the chinese and indians in the market arianespace may not have many commercial contracts i would have loved if asl had chosen an expendable launcher that would evolve toward reusability like the and vulkan
spacex,not_removed,they keep the project only with esa words to provide lauchyear at outrageous price comparing to priceor even spacex price source french support half of the cost again not because they love space because ariane booster is derived from french icbm and they want to keep a solid booster industry in the country source afaik ariane development is funded mainly by esa not by the french directly i hope i really hope a change as a european space fan but inertia and path dependence are strond on this one same as ula so its not really eu oriented i guess what would you have them do then
spacex,not_removed,ariane v is pretty competitive due to the esa subsidies i dont expect to be any different
spacex,not_removed,have they stopped paying into it now i was under the impression esa propping it up was basically the only reason was price competitive
spacex,not_removed,fully agreed i am only speaking from the perspective of if there are customers willing to pay for it whether it may be nasa esa or private im sure spacex would take the revenue the trunk kick stage idea interests me so much because it would require so much less direct development for the moon the kick stage could help serve mars and their other destinations while the lunar dragon itself takes no modifications other than not installing hardware that isnt needed spacex can sell advanced dragon missions across the solar system with this single extra piece of hardware that uses no new tech would i bet on this happening no but i see a valid case for the possibility
spacex,not_removed,we are forgetting a few things here nasa is not the only space agency esa has lunar aspirations and there are actually quite a few commercial interests in the moon today it would make financial sense to develop a lunar dragon to satisfy those concerns how much talent and time can be spared to that is another matter
spacex,not_removed,i hadnt seen that you prompted me to go find the actual international docking standard spec sheet i was wondering if the docking interface could really be used to attach a module that would stay connected during thrust turns out it can the minimum rated axial load for the ids standard is n which is enough to handle full thrust firing of out of the superdracos pretty cool there is a lot you could do with this i found something else really interesting i wanted to know if the fuel transfer specs were enough to directly feed the system during superdraco firing and i found that there are no specs on this yet the latest ids version has a section for fuel transfer that just has reserved under it they havent actually created that part of the standard yet i still like the idea of the kicker trunk but this is a nice alternative plan
spacex,not_removed,expanded fuel tanks andor different engines altogether even coasting in from a lagrange point you need ms delta v to successfully land on the moon i cannot recall the exact delta v a dragon has but i think it is only ms red dragon can use the atmosphere of mars to slow down to within that range before initiating retropropulsion but you cannot do so on the moon these are not terribly difficult changes but as they are orthogonal to spacexs principal aim i do not see spacex implementing any of them without a large contract to do so which nasa is not going to offer
spacex,not_removed,pretty close smart reuse recovery of the first stage engines is part of the plan this will achieve most of the savings of full booster recovery but with far less logistics and performance impacts full recovery is not however ruled out
spacex,not_removed,wouldnt the only shared fuel connector be lox between most vehicles hydrogen and methane most likely requiring different specs yes of course you dont want different propellants pumping through the same duct an example of the sort of standard i was thinking of is the httpwwwinternationaldockingstandardcom which i have heard uses the data connection point to automatically interrogate the other craft as to what connections to make cant find it in the massive definition pdf on that page though
spacex,not_removed,hmm i guess not at least not publicly got that from a misread of tory brunos final paragraph in previous post also from the assumption that fuel transfer feasibility would be on the prototype shortlist right after engines and linerless composite tanks as neither company would be likely to share a tech so pivotal to their near term deep space operations i was attempting to find if there were a less pivotal tech area that would be easier to work on cooperatively but still be beneficial to aerospace in general
spacex,not_removed,i could have sworn elon said at iac they theyd be demonstrating fuel transfer in orbit next year with dragon i dont have time to watch through the presentation right now ill edit in a link if i get the chance
spacex,not_removed,incumbents like ula virgin spacex and rocket lab have the interplanetary freighter and mass transit businesses tied up for decades now but when it comes to extrasolar exploration and luxury fasttransit within the solar system none of their shareholders will let them take the necessary risks to investigate ftl technology yoyodyne propulsion systems is whollyowned by its visionary leader and chief engineer zephram cochrane in after demonstrating a prototype warp drive cochrane founded the company with the singular purpose of colonising proxima centauri b and opening up the near galaxy to human exploration his aim is to enable humanity to become a multistellar species by reducing the cost of access to the neargalaxy by several orders of magnitude he says if we remain in one solar system forever then some eventual extinction event be it a nearby gamma ray burst a rogue black hole rebel nanites or a cultural virus could extinguish the only known light of consciousness from the universe its basically proliferate or die i mean the chance is super big long term so backing up our technosphere at other stars is desirable but really selfpreservation isnt enough to get you up in the morning you need to be excited about the future and i think a future where we are a starfaring civilisation is just fundamentally more inspiring and exciting than one where we are not excerpt from dswyoyodynepropspaceaboutuszfc on sol
spacex,not_removed,i am cautiously optimistic that blue origin is going to become a competitor but their trajectory in development is definitely at a snails pace i had earlier simply thought of it as a result of the skunkworks kind of approach that theyve had in the past where most public information about the company was mainly from official filings like land transfer records and faa airspace clearance requests the recent publicity that seems to be happening there is really quite refreshing this lack of transparency in the operations of blue origin does make it very hard to judge just how much progress theyve made compared to spacex or copenhagen suborbitals perhaps the true competitor to blue origin at the moment bezos could fund out of pocket the entire its development and not break a sweat i wouldnt bet that its is going to be insanely expensive and the actual colonization costs on mars are going to be multiples of that expense still billionaires generally dont get to that level of wealth simply throwing tens of billions of dollars into random projects that wont have any kind of roi and jeff bezos is no exception to that rule the old adage of engineering still applies even for blue origin you can have your projectdesign either cheaper sooner or reliable you must choose at most two of those characteristics i just dont see jeff bezos being the type of person to follow the apollo mantra that was seen on walls of the apollo contractors of waste anything but time nearly constant schedule slippage should tell you how elon musk feels about that adage and what is important for spacex
spacex,not_removed,blue origin is certainly taking their sweet time in getting much accomplished though technically spacex has reused at least a couple rockets particularly the grasshopper and the falcon test vehicle that imho also needs to count in a list of failed launches spacex didnt go for higher altitude tests on those vehicles mainly because of airspace restrictions around the mcgregor test facility imposed by the faa if jeff bezos decides to ramp up the number of employees and turn blue origin into a real competitor to spacex and ula my hat would be off to them dont get me wrong here my main assertion though is that at the moment they really arent even legitimately a competitor and there is room to be critical of the approach that they seem to be taking for their rocket development the lack of transparency for what blue origin is doing also hurts any fair comparison between them and any potential competitors simply because nobody outside of the company really knows what it is that they are doing except for a few very minor announcements
spacex,not_removed,there are rockets which have never failed arianespace rockets are not amongst them due to a few failures early in the crafts lifespan that have now been resolved
spacex,not_removed,adeline isnt full reuseability but of first stage cost is still a lot
spacex,not_removed,youre forgetting oatks nglv as well i dont see the market expanding enough to allow different eelv or higher class vehicle families plus angara and any potential indian entrant to thrive
spacex,not_removed,afaik ariane development is funded mainly by esa not by the french directly le développement du futur lanceur européen destiné à remplacer ariane pour un coût total de milliards sur dix ans la france finance elle de ces millions deuros annuels dont la moitié sera consacrée à ariane the development of the future european launcher designed to replace ariane at a total cost of billion over ten years france is financing it of the million euros per year half of which will be devoted to ariane mais aussi les états qui contribuent au financement dariane la france assure du montant global suivie par lallemagne et litalie but also the states contributing to the financing of ariane france takes of the total followed by germany and italy source for esa providing lauch make it not a third of the maximum lauch capacity over a year la mise sur orbite de satellites institutionnels garantis à la fusée ariane permettrait datteindre un minimum de à lancements par an the lauching of institutional satellites guaranteed to the ariane rocket would reach the minimum of to launches per year required for the financial equilibrium allezvous garantir cinq lancements institutionnels estce possible cela fait partie de laccord will you assure five institutional launches is it possible this is part of the agreement source for synergies between epaslbm this one gonna be hard but you have hints along the road airbus defence space dont le site de bordeaux réalise déjà le bobinage des corps de propulseurs du missile balistique m de diamètre et t de propergol pour le étage se positionne ainsi sur la réalisation de cette pièce essentielle à larchitecture retenue pour le futur lanceur européen face à avio en italie qui réalise le corps du et mt aerospace en allemagne airbus defence space whose factory of bordeaux already carries the winding of the body of the ballistic missile propellants is thus positioned on achieving this essential piece to the architecture chosen for the future european launcher face avio in italy which carries the body of and mt aerospace in germany it was the case for ariane booster and last slbm its a strategic issue to keep knowledge for the next slmb but thoses guys over would be less affirmatif tldr its not simple as bw edit² done witht translations
spacex,not_removed,as far as i know as part of the agreement that ariane would be developped with european aid it would also not recieve any subsidies for its launches
spacex,not_removed,they still prop it up but less so than before theres also the fact that ariane launches two payloads at once so they reduce costs that way too the more ariane launched per year the lower the subsidies are there were a lot of launches last year so subsidies were low
spacex,not_removed,the excalibur multi role capsule was one of the designs used for various studies and that was a development of the bae mrc proposed as an alternative to the esa hermes minishuttle unfortunately most of the papers that have made it online seem to be behind paywalls
spacex,not_removed,thanks tory seriously excited for aces good luck with making it a reality refuelable long duration upper stages seem to be a keystone to our future in space
spacex,not_removed,smart reuse is part of the plan full recovery is not however ruled out maybe jeff bezos has an extra pair of gradatim ferociter boots for you
spacex,not_removed,what factors weigh heaviest in deciding between smart and style full recovery what sort of constraints on the vulcan system make you more likely to go with smart what would need to change for full recovery to become the favoured path
spacex,not_removed,idss has a couple of very simple methods for making sure that whatever fuel or oxidizer you want to transfer you do not put the wrong substance into a port specify a different location for each different propellant up to now that has been something like hydrazine at oclock and cm outside the outer ring of the human transfer port nto at oclock and cm outside the outer ring of the human transfer port these are made up positions but that is the way they have been done so far as i know use different connectors for fuel and oxidizer have data transfer standards that include indicators for proper connection ready to transfer attempting to connect attempting to disconnect and disconnected sensors can be specified as well
spacex,not_removed,one way to settle the tanks during fuel transfers would be to fire thrusters during the whole transfer another way would be to spin the its and the tanker around the mutual axis that lies between them call it the y axis this would of course require the docking connections to be strong enough to take significant gforces from spin
spacex,not_removed,i wouldnt bet that its is going to be insanely expensive youre seriously underestimating how wealthy bezos is bezos sold two large chunks of his amazon shares this year for over billion that accounted for a little over of his amazon stake which is valued at over billion none of this accounts for any other investments or the profits he earns as a shareholder which are not insignificant he made over million from profit payouts recently source im not saying he is going to just throw money at a project with no hope for return but as much as some of us may dislike bezos he became rich to fulfill the dream of getting involved in space exploration the guy is an ultra space nerd that mounted an expedition to dredge up the engines of apollo from the ocean floor just because he is a fan bezos plans to make a profit with his plans but hes also going to be willing and able to take huge risks for the sake of progress i dont know why you brought up copenhagen suborbitals theyre a cool little group and im rooting for them but its literally an amateur operation on an extremely small scale
spacex,not_removed,i can understand your reasonings and i agree that technically they are not a real competitor at this time but then again neither was spacex to ula for the falcon launch bezos has the money to do it right so might as well
spacex,not_removed,ariane atlas have a low chance of failure with several dozens of flight if a rocket has a sucess rate that means that the sample is too small im quite certain that sucess rate wont be seen for at least a century or two
spacex,not_removed,do a little research in what it takes to get or and uptimereliability in computing even systems on the ground that we understand very well dont achieve that standard without incredible costadded space is no different i am echoing on whats said about the sample size edit we have a hard time getting on most things with tons of money thrown at it
spacex,not_removed,there are rockets which have never failed only rockets that have had a very low number of launches like the saturn v even the delta iv and the atlas v have had launch failures even though it didnt happen after ula was formed rocketry is something that is pushing right at the edge of human technology and sitting on the knifes edge of what is even possible in terms of using chemicals to propel hardware into space almost everything used in rocketry can be said to be full of superlatives like metals with the highest melting point hardest surface largest temperature range going from liquid hydrogen temperatures to rocket exhaust temperatures in a matter of seconds is pretty freaking extreme and more that gets just a tiny fraction of a disintegrating pyramid of a payload into space this isnt like sewing a dress or a suit where a minor flaw can be patched up at the last minute or even judiciously hidden if necessary one minor mistake and the whole rocket often blows up this is something spacex has seen the hard way quite recently rocket science is hard
spacex,not_removed,the thing is that ariane wont support adeline it will be the next launcher and even this isnt sure that will use it although it could be based on ariane
spacex,not_removed,ah that resolves it you were talking about france funding the esa funding ariane the funding that france provides is after all included under the esa funding specifically the launcher budget on the part of the launchers though you article says this mais cinq lancements institutionnels cela parait énorme ce sont les ordres de grandeur entre lesa eumetsat la commission et les etats membres nous avons pris des ordres de grandeur réalistes le nombre de lancements institutionnels annuels pour ariane ne sera pas augmenté par rapport à aujourdhui pour atteindre cet objectif chiffré mais cela veut également dire tacitement que chacun pays membre accepte le principe dune préférence européenne mais ce nest pas obligatoire on ne peut pas écrire obligation à cause des règles européennes mais préconiser la préférence européenne est déjà un signe fort this implies that these arent guaranteed launches at inflated costs but rather the expected number of launches that would be happening anyway that would be coming from europe and going to arianespace it implies that may mean choosing an arianespace rocket over a cheaper spacex alternative but i see little to suggest that these missions would pay more than ordinary missions flown on arianespace rockets didnt exactly want a source for synergy with the ballistic missile misquote on my part but the work is appreciated
spacex,not_removed,really huh
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,for this situation its all about the economics of an elv mission in a marketplace that has around total lifts per year and major providers in other words each provider will fly between and times per year thats todays environment rules of thumb rocket is half the cost of the launch service booster is half the cost of the rocket therefore a free booster means a to reduction in the launch service price max unfortunately even reusability does not make the booster free there are added costs to enable booster reusability flyback hardware legs avionics grid fins hydralics etc logistics support recovery ship or pad and operations refurbishment these costs are amortized over the number of reuses x number of reuses generates enough savings to pay for the added costs y reuses actually starts saving enough money to be attractive z reuses is the limit as the hardware reaches end of life booster reuse is not a new idea it has been contemplated studied and even attempted for over years our calculations are consistent with other historical studies and now that sx has hinted at revising their estimate downward from savings to we are potentially consistent with them as well we calculate that it would likely take an average of reuses across the fleet of reusable boosters to break even ie x at a fleet average of y reuses it becomes economically attractive with around a savings in the launch system cost beyond about reuses it probably becomes economically infeasible to continue reuse as the refurbishment costs will escalate so this can work and is worth having however the experience through the learning curve has the potential to be pretty rough because reflights is a steep economic hurdle if you lose any birds their burden of moves to the following birds this can dig a deep economic hole quickly because booster flyback requires significant propellant reserves it can only be done for those missions that have small satellites and low energy orbits which means that you will dwell in the learning curve and initial economic start up cycle for an extended period of time it also means that the really tough missions will be completely infeasible without new propulsion technology or distributed lift closing a business case on that scenario is pretty hard smart reuse is an alternative approach that systems engineers away a number of these impediments and lowers the breakeven hurdle as it turns out over the cost of the booster resides in just one component the engine by separating just the engine at end of flight most of the hardware costs go away it can be done on every mission because no flyback propellant reserves are required refurbishment is cheaper because its only the engine and because the engine does not return propulsively it sees a very benign recovery environment the math says you breakeven at reuses and save ls costs by savings go up from there the recovery technologies used for smart have been around since the so smart should have low technical risk and a short learning curve as well so we like smart better all of this math applies to any elvlike rocket configuration in the type of market i described above this is not a limitation that is unique to vulcan these challenges are inherent to any rocket it is driven by physics and the underlying market conditions a market with of lifts per year as would happen with space tourism or would have happened with reagans star wars would completely change the math a fleet of reusable aces residing in orbit would also change the economics i can see an aces enabled future where all trips from the earths surface stop at leo and hand off to an aces the scenario of very high volume pushes you towards booster recovery and maybe even single stage to orbit reusability ssto the beauty of a competitive environment is that multiple people try different approaches and the market ultimately sorts out the winners thats how innovation happens
spacex,not_removed,you can also use the boiloff compressors to avoid having to settle fuel at all at the cost of power and slightly more time
spacex,not_removed,as far as settling is concerned once youre in zerog thats where the propellant management devices use surface tension to hold the fuel along the walls drawing it towards the tapoff points and excluding air
spacex,not_removed,if the fuel port is near the cog and the distribution of propellant as it is transferred is managed to preserve that cog they could spin both ships about the short axis passing through the docking port that way the port would only be subject to twisting forces rather than any real gs im not sure if they could manage the cog well enough to prevent the port getting mashed
spacex,not_removed,youre seriously underestimating how wealthy bezos is i think you are seriously underestimating just how expensive the its is going to be and how much it is going to cost to colonize mars on the scale that elon musk is proposing over a million people by the end of this century that billion you suggest is the wealth of jeff bezos would be swallowed up by mars and then still not be enough keep in mind that the nasa report about merely sending a small apollo sized crew to mars and back just a couple of times would cost well over billion and that was just an initial rough estimate the its hopefully does quite a bit better but it is this scale of costs and higher that you need to figure if there is money to be made in space i have no doubt that men like elon musk and jeff bezos are going to find it i also wish them both the best of luck in accomplishing those goals too
spacex,not_removed,every rocket that never failed didnt have enough launch hey no moving the goalposts
spacex,not_removed,rocket science really isnt that difficult rocket engineering on the other hand
spacex,not_removed,delta iv and atlas v have never had launch failures delta iv has had one partial failure atlas v has come close a couple times but always had sufficient margin built in to complete the mission
spacex,not_removed,default ariane wont but default falcon didnt do reuse either there are no fundamental design changes required to deploy adeline on ariane as far as i know
spacex,not_removed,i see little to suggest that these missions would pay more than ordinary missions flown on arianespace rockets even if you run them against market years trapped with an expensive launcher years with less money for everything on the side aka science but more years behind in the reusable rocket race
spacex,not_removed,yeah the numbers i was told are million € for the launch customer for an ariane launch with a subsidy of million € from esa i think the ariane shall be operated economically without subsidies for each launch
spacex,not_removed,thankyou so much for taking the time to go into the thought process and economics of your reusability choices i guess time will tell which solution is the better one and i hope that the market expands enough to make booster recovery a viable choice for ula too combined with aces thatd make for a formidable vehicle oh and thanks for being so active on twitter and reddit its great to have your insight available to us we all really appreciate all
spacex,not_removed,short questions are better suited to the ask anything thread
spacex,not_removed,as a software engineer im so jealous of hardware engineers you have something you can touch at the end of day and show it off to your friends sure they probably used simulations and a dozen of specialized applications that without programmers they wouldnt be able to manufacture this pod but still sure google is revolutionary and my super awesome ai can read your thoughts but its not the same as making a rocket that lands on a barge
spacex,not_removed,great video highlights the many participants and their enthusiasm for creating hyperloop technology the many camera angles and aerial views show the massive scale of the test track and the spacex factory elon mentioned that the hyperloop test track is now the second largest vacuum chamber in the world after the large hadron collider edit ok make it one of the largest there are several larger vacuum chambers still extremely impressive
spacex,not_removed,really nice video looks like the spacex crew put up a few displays like a flown pad abortdragonfly dragon out amongst the tents im sure there was a good bit of recruiting happening
spacex,not_removed,any videos of the actual competition part do we get to see these things move
spacex,not_removed,nice video but no footage of the delft or stuttgart pods which is peculiar seeing as how they were the top teams overall
spacex,not_removed,does anyone have an educated guess on how much that track cost to build it cant have been cheap
spacex,not_removed,very awesome one question though i noticed that several of those pods had wheels i know the mit team was talking about maglev and magnetic braking as well so did the rules specify maglev or was any form of suspension you cared to bring ok
spacex,not_removed,what am i missing i thought the pods were supposed to make a close fit inside the tube and produce a low pressure region ahead of them and a higher pressure region behind to push them along theres no close fit here just a cart running along at the bottom of a tube
spacex,not_removed,great video but why vimeo though
spacex,not_removed,does anybody have a reference for the music shazam doesnt im aware that spacex produces some of their own music in house
spacex,not_removed,can anyone make out the big hole on the spacex premises which elon mentioned in his opening remarks
spacex,not_removed,ok i have problem with the hyperloop it is extremely vulnerable to damages in the tubes instead of making a vacuum more feasible way is to move the air inside the tube to decrease the relative velocity between the train and the air and damage to the shell would not end in a disaster
spacex,not_removed,this is why i started playing with arduinos
spacex,not_removed,as someone who moved from a handson career to a computerbased one i feel you its all about finding hobbies where you can get your hands dirty
spacex,not_removed,i used to do embedded systemsfirmware engineering i miss it i got to write code but i was making actual things happen leds turn on and off can messages transmitted on a vehicle network
spacex,not_removed,yeah doing cad for hours and then holding the finished model in your hands is pretty gratifying printers have made it trivially easy and fast too
spacex,not_removed,as a fellow software engineer i agree that having something tangible is cool its probably why i build robots for fun rather than software projects
spacex,not_removed,this is why im a computer engineer i love riding the fence between hardware and software to know where and why the magic happens knowing how the virtual world exists within the silicon registers to be able to take an idea from concept to reality to hold it in my hands poke at it with probes and make it do stuff in the physical world this gives me a sense of fulfillment but it does take a software engineer to correctly design and validate the code thats launching people or sending probes millions of miles away or making our lives better in general gotta check those edge cases a ghost sw and a body hw cant do much without each other
spacex,not_removed,hardware engineer checking in this is all correct
spacex,not_removed,be an embedded systems programmer and get the best of both im not a real programmer but the little things ive done with arduinos and the like have given me a lot of joy seeing the code i wrote have actual effects in the physical world i cant imagine what its like for the folks at spacex who wrote code for landing a rocket all the hardware engineering in the world wont get it off the ground without software
spacex,not_removed,the second largest vacuum chamber in the world after the large hadron collider ligo vacuum tubes for gravitational waves detection are also larger httpswwwligocaltechedupagevacuum httpphysicsaboutcomodastronomyflligolaserinterferometergravitationalwaveobservatoryhtm
spacex,not_removed,how does it compare to the httpsenwikipediaorgwikispacepowerfacility
spacex,not_removed,the wiki for the rhic says its miles long so the hyperloop isnt the second
spacex,not_removed,yeah i got about three different answers to that i was told it was the third largest elon said it was the second largest and steve told us it was the largest by surface area
spacex,not_removed,and a flown merlin next to it not really visible in the video
spacex,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpmdqgmmkgy
spacex,not_removed,stuttgart i think you meant münchen a short video with both pods httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpmdqgmmkgy
spacex,not_removed,many of the pods have wheels either as sole means of transport down the tube or more commonly for takeoff roll motion is required to produce sufficient magnetic force to levitate the pod which is only achieved past a certain speed depending on the design some of the pods also use electric motors to spin round magnets and use this relative motion to levitate when the pod itself is stationary elons hyperloop alpha paper specifies air bearings for levitation but due to the limitations of tube length and consequently speed the majority of teams stuck with maglev designs the competition rules are inviting towards any proposed solution as a means of stirring up ideas
spacex,not_removed,they roll on wheels in the beginning once you get up to speed the halach arrays in the magnet skis lift the pod up
spacex,not_removed,why would it make a low pressure region in the front it would be higher in the front unless you have a really good compressor
spacex,not_removed,because they use way higher bitrates than youtube which makes the video look much better
spacex,not_removed,yup httpsyoutubefpzpugrbwbe a video
spacex,not_removed,thats the definition of a developing technology im sure someone watched the first train slowly trundle down a track somewhere and told whoever built it to come back and talk to them when it could go faster than a horse the whole idea of the hyperloop competition is to foster ideas to flesh out the concept if it was already developed you wouldnt need to have one in the first place who knows if hyperloop is feasible or if theres the market demand but things like this are how you figure that out
spacex,not_removed,the energy required to move that air would be astronomical chess should be a required class thinking at least two moves ahead is a lost art
spacex,not_removed,there is like million kgs of air in the tube at atm and its highly compressible
spacex,not_removed,extremely vulnerable that part of the thunderfoot video was debuked long ago although he never acknoledged that pipes are not lossless friction and viscous interactions between the entering air and the tube wall as well as regular turbulence will slow down that shock front to highway speed wind in only a couple km he totally ignored that try ataching a meter hose to your vaccum cleaner to see how well it sucks or try to breath through a long chain of straws the hyperloop tube is thousand times longer than it is wide plus there is a planned emergency repressurization of the whole tube that would eliminate even that medium speed shock front plus a small diameter bullet hole would imply in less than of the flow of a completely broken tube a much harder feat to do per laws of conservation of energy and matter as pods travel with or so of separation at most one pod will be affected that is much less people than a derailed train and that above is exactly the reason why moving the air inside the tube is a bad idea as it would incur in a lot of energy loss in form of heat and you probably cant get the necessary speed along the tube in the first place
spacex,not_removed,firstly i dont think you deserve any downvotes comment is clearly relevant to the sub in general and this particular thread are you sure that the hyperloop is extremely vulnerable to damaged tubes worst case air would be rushing in at a high speed and impact the pod how fast would it go the speed of sound the pods will be designed to travel that fast and have strong brakes so perhaps they could withstand the wave also according to the whitepaper the system would be designed with pressure sensors located along the tube that automatically communicate and the tube would be capable of rapid repressurization along its entire length
spacex,not_removed,same here combined with printing you can do some cool stuff you can hold in your hand
spacex,not_removed,even though i do significantly more complicated things in my day job playing with an and getting a relay to flip that opens my garage door is a hell of a feeling
spacex,not_removed,but as the rhic is also only a few centimeters in diameter the hyperloop test track may very well be the largest looking at guestimating making the volume the hyperloop test track is httpswwwbadgerloopcomdocumentstubespecspdf im calling it for this and has an inner diameter of making the volume he did say largest not longest
spacex,not_removed,another interesting feature of this one discussed in the live stream is that they can dial the pressure to whatever is optimum for each pod aside from the vacuum issues i was impressed by their ability to make the test track usable with multiple technologies airmagnetic levitation wheels
spacex,not_removed,dracos superdraco combustion chamber
spacex,not_removed,whats the cloudy stuff forming behind some of the pods
spacex,not_removed,so they made go karts and ran them down a tube they arent doing anything that makes the hyperloop a hyperloop what am i missing
spacex,not_removed,my mistake
spacex,not_removed,fair enough dont know why in being downvoted it was a genuine question because youtube is typically the standard
spacex,not_removed,they also tailor to the aspect ratio of the video instead of forcing
spacex,not_removed,is it even for a new technology these maglevs are pretty bad it looks more like a fun students project rather than a serius development programm at least currently
spacex,not_removed,and you want to pump that all out of the tube and conceal it if you keep the air moving you basically store that energy in the movement yes there are huge losses but better than to pump that out and have leakages
spacex,not_removed,hyperloop test track is not the largest ligo tubes are also larger ligos optical components quietly reside in a colossal vacuum chamber encompassing cubic meters
spacex,not_removed,well spacex didnt actually make the tube but dialing in just means not pumping it down as far right and spacex actually didnt make the track usable for multiple technologies really what happened was spacex said this is our track do what you want it was really the teams that made their pod able to work with the track however they wanted not the other way around if that makes sense
spacex,not_removed,most of the pods had levitation systems and are designed to run in a vacuum so uh exactly what makes a hyperloop a hyperloop
spacex,not_removed,i understand hes getting down voted for the negative attitude but i understand his question it isnt obvious from watching the video that the pods had levitation systems if they did thats really cool and certainly a positive step
spacex,not_removed,the hyperloop is nearvaccum to reduce air resistance and allowing faster speeds edit this may be a fullvacuum i remember reading that the fullsized version should be nearvaccum so itd be more safe
spacex,not_removed,wheels are just for lowspeed for example when the mit pod gets up to speed you can see the wheel stops spinning as the maglev takes over this round of tests is mainly for the suspension and levitation which is tricky to get tuned right so it doesnt bounce all over the place propulsion is provided by a spacex pusher which is why the pods go about the same speed for now in the next round of tests there should be more realistic propulsion and youll see more speed differences by the way the tube was at hyperloop atmospheric pressure but i think not all the pods had a working pressure vessel this time ie the inside of some of the pods was the same nearvacuum i found this a bit disappointing
spacex,not_removed,youtube is the most popular but definitely not the standard for higher quality videos and movies plenty of larger corporations have vimeo videos but if you want exposure then youtube is the place
spacex,not_removed,does youtube force a aspect ratio im sure ive seen plenty of footage on there mostly old space footage
spacex,not_removed,it looks more like a fun students project well i mean they are although there has clearly been a lot of work put into them even if im sure the students had fun making them these were very serious projects i suppose i could have phrased my response better to the now deleted comment above which said that they didnt seem very well thought through saying that for an idea like the hyperloop that has no real world examples is rather redundant of course its not completely thought through it hasnt been done before thats why someone needs to start developing the technologies necessary to make it a reality it and a competition like this is one way to try and do that although they maybe werent the most impressive runs the first time out im sure even the spacex engineers saw solutions they hadnt considered thats one of the advantages of bringing so many different teams together everyone thinks a little differently one competition doesnt mean a real hyperloop carrying passengers ever gets built but were one step closer than we were before the weekend
spacex,not_removed,id like to see a comparative analysis just intuitively for me moving the air is going to be much less energy efficient
spacex,not_removed,spacex didnt actually make the tube who made it dialing in just means not pumping it down as far right pumping to specified pressure levels with different levels designated as optimum for different pods well i found it interesting and a number of the big vacuum chambers are just optimized for achieving a very high level of vacuum and spacex actually didnt make the track usable for multiple technologies really what happened was spacex said this is our track do what you want if they didnt take into account the technologies the competitors were likely to use then what would they use as a guide for the design of the tunnel i dont think elon expected all the competitors to use the specific approaches described in the white paper how did the maglev work there were no magnets or anything on the bottom of the track just a rail and some concrete i watched much of the live stream but my connection dropped out several times and i havent found a full length reply online anywhere the participants were given the specifications of the test track but i dont think those were made public
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,i noticed a few prototypes had aerodynamicallydesigned exteriors are those necessary in the vacuum of a hyperloop track
spacex,not_removed,wasnt the whole point of hyperloop that the vehicles are riding on an air cushion for levitation created by a careful routing of partial pressure around the capsule maglev isnt new and its well established that its not costcompetitive unless its subsidized for political reasons going from isnt going to magically make it so
spacex,not_removed,sea level i believe
spacex,not_removed,by tailor to the aspect ratio i mean the player for example take old space footage from youtube its but there are black bars ie the player is always in however take from vimeo its filmed in super panavision and has an aspect ratio of and the entire player fits the aspect ratio of the video uploaded if you want your video to look as good as possible then vimeo offers this
spacex,not_removed,youtube definitely doesnt force any aspect ratio you can upload videos with whatever ratios you want and they will be displayed correctly as a monitor user its driving me mad that so many creators mostly music videos upload videos with added black bars making me either watch inside a black box or use an extension
spacex,not_removed,but you have to agree that there is a significant difference between a magnetic sled made from more or less off the shelve parts and a pressurised train which is intended to travel at mach trough a vaccum tube at this point the hyperloop is really just a hypeloop of course maybe it will become the next big thing but if i had to predict whats going to happen in a best case szenario is a kmh atmospheric maglev simular to the one developed by the jp rail and these are made with a billiondollar budged simply because the risk wie are willing to take when using public transport is so low
spacex,not_removed,to make a vacuum of you need kwh dpv to move of air kmh kwh everything without losses in case of puncture in your tube vacuum tube is a death trap
spacex,not_removed,i forget exactly who made it i forget the company name but i promise you it wasnt spacex and were the specs not made public oh well then i should maybe keep my mouth shut about the details of the tube just in case but i can answer on how the levitation works there were three ways you could levitate on the track air passive mag lev and active mag lev air is pretty simple think of it like an upside down air hockey table active and passive are pretty similar the magnets are almost always what is known as a halbach array its a way of lining up magnets so its really strong on one side and week on the other essentially if you get these magnets moving really fast over certain metals the metal that it is moving over generates a repulsive magnetic force so this means if you do it so the metal is below and the magnets are above the magnets will levitate themselves and the weight that they are holding up like a pod passive levitation means that there are simply magnets on the bottom of the pod that dont move it also has wheels under it to roll around at low speeds once the pod is moving fast enough the magnets that are sliding over the metal start to levitate the pod so the pod only levitates once the pod hits a certain speed active levitation means that instead of using the velocity of the pod to move the magnets over the track you actually have the magnets rotate at very high speeds this means that you can levitate while the pod isnt moving
spacex,not_removed,wait did the wheel stop spinning
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercommithyperloop first ever vacuum tube hyperloop run watch the wheel mithyperloop spacex hyperloop maglevworks this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,its not a total vacuum so yes it helps
spacex,not_removed,hyperloop is not a hard vacuum its more like the pressure at high altitudes where aeroplanes fly the reason is that going from ambient pressure to highaltitude pressure is relatively cheap but going from highaltitude to hard vacuum is very expensive in terms of energy the necessary quality and materials of the vacuum chamber etc
spacex,not_removed,the original idea was for air cushioning but for the competition they accommodated other options as well maglev and wheeled presumably to encourage more participation no point in locking in hard limitations when spacex isnt going to be designing or building them
spacex,not_removed,tube was full vac less than atm
spacex,not_removed,thanks so the magnets are in the pod not built into the track about minutes seems to include a lot of the explanatory material from the stream dont take my word for it that the specs were not made public i could be mistaken about that
spacex,not_removed,yes most of the pods used wheels to roll at low velocity until the pusher gets the pod to the point where it can levitate at the magnets produce enough lift to levitate the pod edit at which point the wheels are no longer in contact with the track
spacex,not_removed,yeah the pod was airborne for most of the run thanks to magnetic levitation wheels are just there for launch and landing
spacex,not_removed,ahh okay thanks
spacex,not_removed,main new info that i can see nonetheless tel testing has been proceeding to plan with the first throwback test completed which will be a change to how the transporter erector performs during a launch normally the te retracts away from the rocket with just over three minutes to launch however the throwback method will see the tel remain in place before retracting rapidly at
spacex,not_removed,does anyone know the reason behind the te procedure change if i had to guess its that the throwback method allows for shorter hoses that will be pulled out of the way with the te to avoid the worst of the blast
spacex,not_removed,so right now we have two falcons ready to go in the hanger im curious if pad readiness is pulled together could echostars core be static fired ahead of say on feb to bring down the turnaround between them in this scenario echostar could be fully integrated and ready to fly when goes up its only bottleneck would be pad refurb something that should be easier than on previous pads with the fancy new te
spacex,not_removed,ugh this te throwback thing is giving me anxiety i know there are new features and procedures on practically every spacex launch but the thought of the te failing to retract at and snagging the rocket somehow leg on the way up is terrifying
spacex,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters last usagehttpwwwnasagovmissionpagesstationstructurelaunch last usageground support equipment last usagehorizontal integration facility last usagelaunch complex kennedy spacex last usageno earlier than last usagerocket propellant enhanced kerosene last usageformerly socieacuteteacute europeacuteenne des satellites comsat operator last usagestatic fire last usagespace launch complex canaveral spacex last usagespace launch complex vandenberg spacex last usagetransportererector launch pad support equipment last usagetransportererector launch pad support equipment last usagetransportererectorlauncher ground support equipment see te decronym is a community product of rspacex implemented im a bot and i first saw this thread at jan utc ive seen acronyms in this thread which is the most ive seen in a thread so far today httpdecronymxyz httpsredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
spacex,not_removed,so if launches on say february and being conservative and assuming a three week turnaround that pushes echostar to roughly march and to the very end of march maybe april or which is then getting close to the next iridium net date
spacex,not_removed,i guess ses will be delayed into march then
spacex,not_removed,what would be the reasoning or any potential benefit for using the throwback method over retracting the strongback before launch like normal
spacex,not_removed,purely guessing but it could be a change required for the heavy that trickled down to fh has significantly more mass and surface area and might not be stable resting without support
spacex,not_removed,i doubt they would attempt this simply because of the constraints on the launch timing if there were to be any issues with the echostar sf that damaged the pad it would jeopardize the success of
spacex,not_removed,they wont do this here but the could in future however if they get reliability to the stage where theyd do this then youd have to question whether there is any value in doing a static fire
spacex,not_removed,static fire is a test of the rocket and the pad i guess they would want to do this after again to make sure the pad is still ok after the first launch
spacex,not_removed,depends on if they have to do any fit modifications between cores and if they think theres any time element to rocket readiness after static fire i would hope the first is no but cant guarantee it and the second is probably no given the length of time weve seen between test and launch due to various scrubs
spacex,not_removed,i mean theyve had baseclamps retracting at at every launch and you arent concerned about them continuing to hold are you i would imagine its the same kind of thing heck they might even have the launch sequence be ignition throwback clamps so that if the throwback fails the clamps will not release and the vehicle can safely throttle down
spacex,not_removed,slightly worried about this thing too but i assume they have contingency plans for example it shouldnt be hard to rig the hold down so that it would only release after the te starts falling
spacex,not_removed,being conservative and assuming a three week turnaround i dont think so echostar is ready to go its just waiting for the pad to be ready i think this will be a day turnaround max that number is pulled directly from my ass edit for reference the current turnaround record is days but now that i think about it they have two rockets just sitting there wanting to be launched thats insane my bet is going to be a day turnaround final answer
spacex,not_removed,we have already seen one launch aborted after ignition perhaps the throwback is required to provide support for postignition abort of fh
spacex,not_removed,no umbilicals to get destroyed reducing the things that will need to be replaced allowing the pad to support rapid cadence with a design like this the second stage and payload connections can be short and when released can be retracted fully into the strongback and be protected really nice improvement
spacex,not_removed,i feel i remember from a thread long past that the throwback helps the te get out of the way of the angry rocket engines faster reducing the amount of refurbishment required shorter hoses are consistent with this as well
spacex,not_removed,this is just a guess but it might have something to do with planned future manned operations
spacex,not_removed,im sure theres something else but the feed lines do sometimes cause problems exploding catching fire i can see them using this method and forgoing the feed lines and connecting directly to the rocket
spacex,not_removed,stage testing all other answers are secondary benefits
spacex,not_removed,perhaps but it seems odd that the fh could support itself on its thrust structure at maxq but not while its just sitting on the ground
spacex,not_removed,might also be something to support crewed flights that for some reason nasa didnt want the tel gone until the last moment which would imply wed see a similar fast moving white room crew access arm if so
spacex,not_removed,theyve already started or plan to start soon gwynne made comments to the effect last year just doing full integrated core duty firings at macgregor not single merlins
spacex,not_removed,keep in mind that static fire is a test of the people just as much as it is a test of the equipment when you get a new guy working on a launch its nice for them to be able to have a practice run
spacex,not_removed,i know clamps and a thousand other systems have to work just right at but nobody ever said anxiety had to be rational
spacex,not_removed,that was my though too in the event of failure of tel retraction it would likely be set up to continue to restrain the rocket i wonder if the tel retraction is probably based on some explosive pins so that you get guaranteed retraction when the pins go
spacex,not_removed,morning of the takes off almost immediately the te is brought back to the hif echostar is loaded on for static fire static fire is done late on the february the full stack is rolled out for sweet sweet launch
spacex,not_removed,i remember hearing the pad was going to be rebuilt with falcon heavy in mind so does that mean no major alterations will need to be made to the ground equipment for a fh launch
spacex,not_removed,robbak the second stage and payload connections can be short and when released can be retracted fully into the strongback and be protected this would fit with the plate seen in photos separating the strongback from the launcher it would protect the retracted payload connections the vertical plumbing and cables refurbishment would be more pleasant too not having greasy girders soiled by combustion products
spacex,not_removed,if thats the case i wonder why they didnt borrow from the soyuz pad design
spacex,not_removed,very well could be its possible that the crew access arm rests on the top of the te and needs to be available to the crew up until launch so then at both swing away at the same time
spacex,not_removed,dont know what you mean by that could you elaborate
spacex,not_removed,stage can be tested tanking and firing without the need of a new te retraction procedure spacex could fire a first stage by itself on or if they so wanted to
spacex,not_removed,different kinds of forces sitting on the pad in some winds unsupported by the te itd face shear forces all concentrated at the holddown clamps in flight at maxq its facing axial forces mainly at the payload fairing and nosecones
spacex,not_removed,takes off almost immediately the te is brought back to the hif echostar is loaded on for static fire static fire is done late on the february the full stack is rolled out forlaunch i too wonder what keeps launches so far apart and dont believe that the cause is just the size of the hanger on with space for five cores which is not such a big investment so even for the hanger would not have been economized upon at construction time elon has already shown that he anticipates far ahead thus on any slc it would be easy to line up four launchers all being prepared in parallel and ready one after the next to help us understand better is there a url somewhere with a list of things on the critical path between launches also what is automated preparation a term that appeared somewhere on this subreddit
spacex,not_removed,definitely the installation of the on the pad deck possibly the addition of propellant storage to support three first stages
spacex,not_removed,that soyuz design is kind of slick when you think about it the arms supporting the rocket on the pad do so near the points where the boosters lift the central core so added weight for the support points is minimized
spacex,not_removed,i really doubt crew access arm needs to rest on the te that sounds like an added complication without benefit
spacex,not_removed,dont hold your breath for him to elaborate he usually cites his private source makes a lessthannice rebuttal to being grilled for questions after a vague statement then goes radio silent
spacex,not_removed,spacex could fire a first stage by itself on the te didnt have a cradle low enough to support just a first stage so when they static fired after landing they had to use a crane to put it on the launch pad
spacex,not_removed,how many hold down clamps will fh have it makes sense to me that theyd have to move some of the hold down clamps so as to minimise interference with the boosters eg two either side of each core
spacex,not_removed,i think a part of it is of refurbishment
spacex,not_removed,just me being totally pedantic sorry but friendly reminder that theres no space in front of just
spacex,not_removed,these arms have their downside they are holding in place only by rockets weight and retracting as soon as engines reach full thrust so you cant abort after that point or do a static firing
spacex,not_removed,i really doubt crew access arm needs to rest on the te its not that it will need to its more just a result of the orientation of dragon and the te structures the dragon access door will face the te ie on falcon and the main te frame conveniently ends right below dragons trunk
spacex,not_removed,is is anything like the cradle can be moved down they did that with for that tanking test
spacex,not_removed,how many hold down clamps will fh have eight it will look like for falcon launches and httpimgurcomhnncgye for falcon heavy launches the launch clamps in red are on removable inserts
spacex,not_removed,i think a part of is refurbishment refurbishment of the te would be changing hoses and checking pressure lines on the launch pad there would be checking the holddown clamps and equipment connecting to the te all these things would be designed to be declipped and replaced there would be a structural check on the te which could be done quickly with laser measuring any fixed equipment such as and oxygen tanks and water reservoirs could be replenished within a day used first stages are another question entirely and would be dealt with elsewhere with sufficient trained and competent personnel available you could easily imagine a hour turnaround although if there is a test firing without the payload this would imply an extra return trip to the hanger plus the payload integration time in this case a total of four days would seem reasonable to anyone working there this may seem provocative and its not my intention im just trying to understand the basic issues that determine launch spacing
spacex,not_removed,the crew are far safer in the capsule than outside
spacex,not_removed,yes the te does end low enough after going back and looking i couldnt find anything that showed the actual orientation dragon will have mated to falcon though as far as i can tell were just assuming they will follow what they did with dragon after looking closer i still dont think the crew access arm will rest on the te there is more than enough clearance for it to be an independent structure but i do think youre probably right that it will swing over the te from that side
spacex,not_removed,is is anything like thats the problem theyre almost nothing alike is much more like
spacex,not_removed,what exactly are tail service masts where did these images come from
spacex,not_removed,not if the inside of their capsule lights on fire
spacex,not_removed,what exactly are tail service masts are the tail service masts there are two of them and they transfer fuel into the first stage via connections where did these images come from i made based on given to us by a spacex employee who is working on the gse
spacex,not_removed,what the main prevention of that happening again lower by volume
spacex,not_removed,gotcha thanks
spacex,not_removed,thanks thats the first time ive seen the inlet
spacex,not_removed,according to the apollo wikipedia article there were several improvements made they adjusted the cabin atmosphere so that there was lower concentration redesigned the spacesuits from using nylon to using beta cloth added an outward opening explosive hatch that could be opened in five seconds and replaced loads of flammable materials inside the cabin as far as spacex is concerned im sure all of those adjustments made to the apollo capsule are now commonplace in spacecraft design
spacex,not_removed,after my initial excitement and flailing around my bedroom i realized that this may have been better for todays media thread i can delete and repost as a comment uzucal edit nevermind i just refreshed the launch thread and saw it was first posted on instagram sorry for the spam
spacex,not_removed,keep it up the facebook version has controls for skipping and maximizing the video instagram version does not rip
spacex,not_removed,former use of this facility was space shuttle and international space station payload processing maybe this was common knowledge but i had no idea thats super cool i want to work there so bad its insane
spacex,not_removed,this isnt the booster processing facility its not nearly large enough the booster processing facility is going to be the new construction right next to this building
spacex,not_removed,clean room and tile ceilings apparently its a low bar the lunar conference room is cool though
spacex,not_removed,original discussion months ago
spacex,not_removed,why does it have airlocks
spacex,not_removed,its interesting to note that the cleanrooms length is the exact height of the first stage feet im curious to see if spacex will removerebuild a connecting wall for an entire stage to fit or if only portions of the booster will be sent here for refurbishment until the larger hangar is completed or perhaps this building will be used for second stage and fairing refurbishment when those systems are online theyd definitely fit in that room if not all at once and that would leave first stage processing to the larger hangar
spacex,not_removed,oh wow i didnt know this much was already there what other work does spacex have to do to get it ready to process landed stages
spacex,not_removed,considering the limited nature of the market is the fact of publishing this offer just to fulfill a legal obligation or is this kind of workshop a common thing to let and to rent the clean room is said to have a tontonne gantry crane in the main hangar the presence of a crane is not mentioned is this then an implicit assumption edit just a minute seeing ugnonthgol it makes much better sense to build a bigger hangar outside the facility that is actually large enough to house a falcon rocket and then use the clean room for smaller things does this mean that its plausible that spacex will be building a hangar on rented property it seems just as surprising as rebuilding a rented launch pad because the investment would have to be written off over the tenancy period the owners would find themselves with either a valuable or cumbersome building when the next tenant arrives
spacex,not_removed,i think these plans are more of a real estate listing the only plan in the link is the current floor plan of the building
spacex,not_removed,is it big enough for vertical integration of dod payloads that would then be moved out to to be craned on top of the stack seems like that would be possible use for part of this building

spacex,not_removed,its the old httpwwwastronautixcomsspacehabhtml building
spacex,not_removed,this facility will require extensionsrenovations but a lot of things are already there to support processing activities eg utilities offices etc the new squarefoot construction next door will be more appropriate to be used as a storage hangar for the refurbished boosters
spacex,not_removed,yes a class clean room is not that clean look at a class facility and that is much different
spacex,not_removed,there are different levels of clean room this example has a droptile ceiling in this case the tiles arent the typical material you may be familiar with httpwwwcleanairtechnologycomimagescleanroombigjpg
spacex,not_removed,keep the dust out the building runs positive pressure so air flows out through an open door so you need an airlock to make sure all the air entering the building has gone through the filtration system
spacex,not_removed,its interesting to note that the cleanrooms length is the exact height of the first stage feet the first stage is feet with an interstage im curious to see if spacex will removerebuild a connecting wall for an entire stage to fit or if only portions of the booster will be sent here for refurbishment until the larger hangar is completed this building will never house first stages its not nearly large enough and all the entrance ways are situated very poorly for getting first stages in and out
spacex,not_removed,i think feet is the version not the ft version either way they aint going to be able to drive it through the front door and turn it sideways theres simply not enough clearance there are no other big enough doorsairlocks that go outside im pretty sure that the building needs to be modified unless is not actually for the boosters but for something else
spacex,not_removed,from the earlier florida today article this quote the lease includes the former spacehab facility at magellan road on the north side of the port the company also plans to build an adjacent hangar on the parcel makes me think that theyre going to build a separate long narrow garage for first stage core storage
spacex,not_removed,that building isnt suitable theres nowhere whole stages would fit the two largest rooms could if you removed the connecting wall but the only access in is via a narrow parking lot at one end so you couldnt get the stages in this building will likely be used to work on parts from them rebuilding removed engines for instance as well as office space and likely also payload processing in that large cleanroom the actual stage processing is going to happen in the large hangar that they are building and that hangar is going to be huge like big enough to fit stages
spacex,not_removed,there is a lot of dirt being moved adjacent to this leased building so probably a lot
spacex,not_removed,hangars is usually made from a light modular structure and is in relatively high demand so setting up a hangar on a rented property and then selling it after years when the lease is up is not unusual you can even find used hangars on ebay you might want to stick around a bit for one of the size that spacex wants they have been known to source stuff from ebay before so if they see a listing for a rocket hangar at they might bid on it and move it to florida or texas
spacex,not_removed,they get some of the hangar costs back as a rebate on the rent the lease is for years with two five year rights of renewal and no doubt an extension will be possible after that in any case they will have years to write off the cost of the hangar and i am not sure will still be flying in years as it will be a year old rocket design
spacex,not_removed,is it big enough for vertical integration of dod payloads but that brings us back to itar security constraints and authorized personnel that could include a painter a cook or a gardener it may be that spacex needs breathing room outside a security perimeter comparable to the civilian brownsville site
spacex,not_removed,sure this building might be okay for fairings dragons and maybe even second stages i was just clarifying that its not for first stages
spacex,not_removed,i designed an hvacfilter system for a class clean room once for a client we usually just did office residential spaces so i had no idea what i was doing and my boss didnt either i did some research before i designed it and apparently it ended up being way cleaner than they needed i specd a really neat differential pressure monitoring system and now they love to show their customers the cleanroom from an observation window they have one satisfied customer
spacex,not_removed,class and i thought the cubesat clean rooms were dirty for being class
spacex,not_removed,i just figure i see dropped ceiling tiles i see a millions airflow holes to allow unfiltered air inout i had no idea that a numerically lower class is better but that explains why it would have such a high number
spacex,not_removed,airlocks arent a particularly complex feature most calibration labs have them and at their simplest they just consist of a short hallway with double doors on each end the positive pressure is the important thing because it means you dont need to have particularly well sealed doors the cracks around the door just vent the positive pressure which blows any dust away from the doors
spacex,not_removed,buildings are not that difficult to add on to never is a very strong wording unless you have direct evidence that they arent going to modify it
spacex,not_removed,like big enough to fit stages whoa so this will be dramatically larger than any of the other hangars or processing facilities that they already have at the cape right i think their hangars at each pad can hold maybe first stages plus theyll have the dragon facility at this is getting intense
spacex,not_removed,they have been known to source stuff from ebay before i would love to read more about this do you have a source
spacex,not_removed,ugnonthgol might bid on and move it to florida or texas amazing that might make a net economy of say after deconstruction all that glass wool transport concrete slab and reconstruction same as for boca chica itll be interesting to see the decided httpswwwscientificamericancomarticleseasrisingbutfloridakeepsbuildingonthecoast when the boss is a nonclimateskeptic
spacex,not_removed,is an old age for a rocket design im thinking there is a lot of aircraft flying around that are more than year old designs i dont know if thats the same in the rocket world though
spacex,not_removed,it looks to me as if first stage boosters could be fit inside with enough extra room to process them postflight only modification to the astriumatrium door is needed what am i missing
spacex,not_removed,i had no idea what i was doing and my boss didnt either i did some research before i designed it and apparently it ended up being way cleaner than they needed always a nice problem to have
spacex,not_removed,the classification number is the number of particles per cubic meter of air so outside air would be httpwwwcleanairtechnologycomcleanroomclassificationsclassphp the facility has deteriorated since it was no longer in use for shuttle and apparently roof leaks are responsible for the missing and damaged roof tiles
spacex,not_removed,one of the main uses was for spacehab processing and if youre going to be putting people inside the thing when it gets on orbit there isnt a lot of point trying to keep it absolutely spotless you dont want the crew running their finger along the top of a rack and tutting at the grime but they are going to be shedding while they are in the module anyway
spacex,not_removed,and what about the dropped ceiling tiles is it that prevents filters being located in the air vents that goes in the dropped ceiling even high quality clean rooms will have a dropped ceiling to make managing air flow much easier
spacex,not_removed,i see dropped ceiling tiles i see a millions airflow holes to allow unfiltered air inout really itll depend on whats above the ceiling if the area above is within the clean envelope then theres no unfiltered air to flow inoutaround the tiles
spacex,not_removed,you are aware that this number is just urobbak speculating spacex have not published any plans for a new processing facility however a hangar to store and work on several rockets at once is likely needed to service and maintain a fleet of rockets the rockets will spend most of their time on the ground and will require maintenance from time to time that puts them out of commission
spacex,not_removed,rocket families tend to last a long time such as atlas and delta even though the current atlas v and delta iv are only years old the delta iv is being phased out now and the atlas v will be in about years time the classic oldtimer is the soyuz useries which has only just been phased out after years in service in summary the natural life of a rocket family member is about years at least in the west but spacex have a higher innovation rate and are likely to supersede their designs much earlier than this
spacex,not_removed,it looks to me as if first stage boosters could be fit inside with enough extra room to process them postflight im not sure exactly where youre seeing that the integration hall is only feet long a first stage is feet the amount of structural changes needed to make that building big enough for first stages is not worth the effort
spacex,not_removed,the clean room is not long enough to house the entire first stage and the first stage does not need a clean room as dust buildup is not a problem for it however it is a much bigger deal for a lot of cargo and the dragon spacecraft and maybe for single components in the first stage it makes much better sense to build a bigger hangar outside the facility that is actually large enough to house a falcon rocket and then use the clean room for smaller things
spacex,not_removed,not exactly fed std norm which is used in the usa doesnt follow iso recommendations and the class of the clean room is approximate number of µm particles in a cubic foot of air outside air would be class times more dust than in the newly aquired clean room so not that big of a difference httpwwwcleanairtechnologycomcleanroomclassificationsclassphp
spacex,not_removed,spacex have not published any plans for a new processing facility from the earlier florida today article the lease includes the former spacehab facility at magellan road on the north side of the port the company also plans to build an adjacent hangar on the parcel
spacex,not_removed,imagine a world where there was only one international standard and everyone agreed it was good enough an impossible dream i know but a man can dream
spacex,not_removed,it still means a dust reduction of at least potentially even better and you can upgrade it of course
spacex,not_removed,plans to build an adjacent hangar on the parcel so the building area is and including interstage is so allowing at each end gives long x wide as the cores are wide and occupy around on their cradles and allowing working space between cores and to the hangar walls gives cores with plenty of room to work on each one simultaneously that is a serious hangar
spacex,not_removed,we are so so close but theres always got to be an outlier or two
spacex,not_removed,the real world is unfortunately more like situation there are competing standards ridiculous we need to develop one universal standard that covers everyones use cases yeah soon situation there are competing standards fortunately the charging one has been solved now that were all standardized on miniusb or is it microusb shit
spacex,not_removed,assuming no stacking that gives a ton more space question is if they need to edit or just store em upright
spacex,not_removed,ya that one little eccentric country thats a bit quirky but lovable so everyone puts up with them ruining their systems
spacex,not_removed,honestly the worst part of most standards is that they arent freely available governments should maintain and update standards and they should be freely available that would be useful
spacex,not_removed,just store em upright so a building that is high to allow a long x diameter stage to swing into the vertical plus the crane overhead height so ft high in the old money or the equivalent of a story office block
spacex,not_removed,bloody americans and myanmar and libya
spacex,not_removed,the ignition fluid they use is teateb which ignites on contact with oxygen iirc im a bit fuzzy on the details if you want more info please ask it in our ask anything threads
spacex,not_removed,while id also love to see this happen i cant help but wonder if they may just be making sure they have range resources reserved just in case we are ready perhaps if we have causefactorssolution all identified in the next couple weeks
spacex,not_removed,this would be greatid be happy feels incredibly unrealistic thougheven for elon time
spacex,not_removed,my understanding is even nasa has trouble explaining why copvs sometimes suddenly fail so it could be if they have narrowed it down to a copv losing integrity there isnt much they can do short term and nasa is willing to take the risk after looking over the design and test data
spacex,not_removed,making crs the first rtf mission could have several advantages first no worry about a satellite company going out of business if something goes wrong nasa could send a load of useful but nonessential supplies which if its lost would be bad but not catastrophic second following the loss of nasa absorbed a big financial loss but negotiated a deal with spacex where future discounts on launches would pay back a lot of that loss nasa is spacexs best customer and nasa knows that spacex is good for eventual payback if something goes wrong of course spacex shouldnt launch until theyve taken every reasonable precaution against a mission failure there may be some possible causes for which they cant identify which one caused it but they can protect against any of them happening
spacex,not_removed,will this be the first launch from ksc since sts was retired
spacex,not_removed,is spacex officially grounded until the investigation is complete as in even if they wanted to just say fuck it and launch tomorrow they couldnt because the faa wont issue a license i am unclear whether its internal policy or government regulations that would prevent them from flying until the investigation is complete or the root cause identified and fixed
spacex,not_removed,i could see them finishing the pad by then but i am not so sure if falcon is ready again at that time elon at iac that the anomaly has yet to be resolved
spacex,not_removed,a week rtf after that kind of rud would be insane in a good way cant see it personally but its good to be more optimistic than me
spacex,not_removed,the sidebar says what do i believe not that it makes much difference really
spacex,not_removed,is there a reason that spacex could be wanting to rtf with a dragon instead of a commercial sat increased chance that if there was an abort dragon would survive or no commercial provider wants to hop on first granted this is assuming they are right and is next
spacex,not_removed,orbital thought theyd figured out the problem with the oco launch failure when they launched the glory satthey didnt and had another lom nasa has not launched a major sc on orbitals taurus again they opted to launch the replacement on ulas delta ii and ula again got the job after antares lom spacex better get the investigation right or it could be handing its major competitor a huge break
spacex,not_removed,interesting this is a lot different then just saying you hope to rtf in november they are actually planning for this date guess well just have to wait and see what happens
spacex,not_removed,time to update the sidebar uzucaluechologic
spacex,not_removed,was there a date for this resupply prior to happening

spacex,not_removed,i did some quick fact checking on the statement that rockets blow up all the time people just pay more attention to us since rockets have failed of them belonging to spacex that means they make up of the failures in the last or so months
spacex,not_removed,well it cant be super unrealistic because according to nasa is scheduled for november no day given though
spacex,not_removed,very exciting news its impressive that spacex has bounced back from the anomaly this quickly that said i very much hope that spacex isnt falling prey to go fever months seems awful quick to rtf
spacex,not_removed,this is probably just a place holder for schedulingthe best case scenario would be that they are near to nailing down the root cause and are running through the validation testing now
spacex,not_removed,nothing has changed until the decide why the last one burned rtf is indefinitely postponed november is the earliest date they may fly not the likely date
spacex,not_removed,we all know that date wont hold but that does indicate it will be in less than months which is a huge plus i assume this also means they knew what blew up and that it wasnt something that would compromise the entire design for a long time like if an engine had failed on
spacex,not_removed,i am not a fan of doing rtf at if somehow a repeat were to happen of a similar failure while on the pad the damage to the pad will hurt many many times more than now there is a lot more there to be damaged and it means no gto or iss flights for the many months it will take to get a pad back online even if they discovered the cause the very next day at the very least spacex should ship a repaired core and second stage to vandy and do a dress rehearsal for iridium first the loss of the vandy pad will be extremely painful as well yet it is far better than losing and if all goes well you can simply go straight to the iridium flight after
spacex,not_removed,interesting detail at the end of the article i havent seen talking much about it says despite scheduling nov for that they still arent sure if rtf will be out of of vandenberg
spacex,not_removed,a few thoughts that have been floating through my head in order that spacex can be flying by november if we were to consider that the helium storage failed in some yet to be determined way then in order for spacex to be flying again in short order by november a quick and technically sound solution needs to be found it occurs to me that a perfectly sound solution would be to use two copv vessels at a lower pressure i do not have the time to do the maths on this but for a limited increase in weight of the second stage the pressure in the suspected offending vessel could be reduced considerably thereby removing or at least significantly reducing the risk overall pressure is not as far as i can determine the issue for a successful flight it is volume of course if the copv was not the issue then using two vessels also has advantage of reducing the pressure in the pipeworka win win apologies if this has been proposed elsewhere j
spacex,not_removed,i still believe rtf will be iridium
spacex,not_removed,are they really going to have a falcon launch before they conclude the investigation seems incredibly haphazard
spacex,not_removed,also lets recall that if coding was in place dragon would have been fine after the in flight last problem i suppose you couldnt get much more damage than the second stage exploding underneath you i am doubtful it could have survived the fall from the top of the rocket
spacex,not_removed,im happy to see that spacex is getting back on its feet so quickly after the pad anomaly especially since their target rtf date of november is my birthday
spacex,not_removed,any info on what they are going to launch next
spacex,not_removed,do more people agree that they really know the cause already and probably knew a few seconds before the accident and that is why they can predict a rtf so quickly
spacex,not_removed,well did they specify the year but i am skeptical as well due to all the open factors
spacex,not_removed,in some ways elon musk reminds me of the infamous aircraft designer jim bede only hes much more successful at meeting his promises eventually the author richard bach built and flew a he had these comments about jim bede if i were a country set to build a supersecret blackphantom airplane one that would make all the world blink and say o there is one person on the planet id choose to design that airplane and that person is mr james r bede of newton kansas mr bede would design for a while with a napkin and a pencil and with his pocket univac and then he would say in a very calm voice that he can promise me a machine that will fly at speeds of nearly miles per hour with a range of miles that will build simpler and fly lighter than any phantomplane ever built and this machine is only going to cost me per each all the other nations of the world would laugh at jim and me what a pitiful sight that poor little country taken in by a smooth promoter impossible and everyone knows it the man cant deliver an airplane that will fly like that the other nations would build good normal aircraft and say impossible impossible that bede fellow and you know they would be absolutely right james r bede would not be able to deliver what he promised what he would deliver far short of the illusionmachine on the napkin would be a phantomplane that would cruise a mere mph with a range of only miles that would cost per each bare without radios it would arrive three years late and it would fly better than any airplane in history and the other countries would say we told you so your airplane he built for you is miles per hour slower than he said it would be it doesnt have that unbelievable range not by a long shot old fellow and it is costing you times more than he promised you and i would smile and say true how good are your phantomplanes other countries they would sigh and say about half as good my phone would ring then and why its jim to sell me a new design that will fly miles per hour miles in the air id know what those words mean id know from those words how the airplane would really fly and id tell him jim do it but should the man ever say to me hi little country how about me starting a factory for you i want to make simple plain piper cubs on schedule id be forced to stare down at the papers on my desk not look him in the eye and say mr bede im sorry like jim bede elon musk similarly makes big promises unlike jim bede musk eventually delivers hes often years late but he delivers httpsenwikipediaorgwikijimbede
spacex,not_removed,what is the equation for elon time to real time
spacex,not_removed,i dont think its incredibly unrealistic they may know what happened or they will know when their internal test will end with the root cause discovered its called project planing
spacex,not_removed,that seems like a reasonable timeline thats when the new pad should be ready theyll probably just swap out the most likely causecauses of the rud on a falcon already in testingproduction if its the helium bottles they could just swap them out for a more sturdy proven bottle till they fix the existing design in question
spacex,not_removed,can we please stop with this elon time meme its not very constructive there are other better ways to express what you are trying to say without triggering the inevitable elon time chain thanks
spacex,not_removed,the thing that few people realize is return to flight missions are actually fairly lowrisk a failure in flight implies that there was a problem and a return to flight implies that the problem has been solved therefore the rtf mission is threatened less by failure than any other flight before it which were all theoretically threatened by the issue that finally led to a failure thus if the customer considered it acceptable risk to entrust a mission to the rocket before its failure it stands to reason that the customer would also consider it acceptable risk even less risk to entrust a mission to the same rocket after its failure of course it is not always this black and white this viewpoint assumes that the failure was caused by a technical problem which can be addressed by a technical solution if it turns out that a rocket failed becaue of an organizational issue poor qa lazy execution mismanagement the works then you cannot as easily assume that the issue can fundamentally be fixed from one launch to the next this is what worried or perhaps still worries people so much about proton which suffered a whole series of failures that are generally attributed to organizational issues so to sum up my point the fact that nasa is okay with scheduling the next crs mission even before the formal wrapup of the investigation says less about their trust in the as a launch vehicle but rather more about their trust in spacex as a company nasa appears to give spacex the benefit of the doubt essentially saying we do not believe that this company has an organizational problem that led to the pad explosion event we choose to believe that a technical issue will be discovered and a fix will be implemented therefore we see no reason to suspend our use of the falcon launch vehicle
spacex,not_removed,do you have a source for this would like to know more
spacex,not_removed,not sure why the copvs are getting all the press shuttle used them for decades and none of them cause a flight failure was not a copv failure but rather likely a strut failure which caused the copv to accelerate forward due to density difference between lox and he rupturing the he feedlines if i were to bet anything on this it would be a he feedline issuepossibly due to the additional thermal shock of dealing with the superchilled lox and an assembly or material control qa flaw
spacex,not_removed,plus if an exact copy of were to happen again the dragon and its cargo would likely survive the pressurised cargo at least since spacex have updated the dragon software to deploy its parachutes if it survives an inflight rud as it did in until it impacted the water without parachutes this means nasa wouldnt lose anything more than the unpressurised cargo in the trunk
spacex,not_removed,tldr nasa can afford to throw money away but wait who really ultimate foots this risk
spacex,not_removed,from yes the last mission from this pad was
spacex,not_removed,yes first launch since on july incidentally also the last space shuttle flight
spacex,not_removed,my understanding could be wrong is that since the failure occurred on the pad and not in flight the faa isnt the one blocking them from launching again its more the air force and spacexs customers
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomjefffoust musk anomaly investigation still top priority most vexing and difficult thing ruled out all the obvious possibilities this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,might have been a mod typo its fixed now
spacex,not_removed,id be willing to bet reddit gold that or another falcon launch happens within a week plus or minus of november this is an emotional bet and ive lost on an emotional bet before so high stake spacex this is your chance to catch a sucker
spacex,not_removed,dragon is not currently able to abort in the case of an anomaly its only able to deploy its parachutes in the slim chance that it survives rud but i wouldnt classify that as abort capabilities
spacex,not_removed,just because that last rocket exploded doesnt mean just became unreliable there sure are commercial partners that arent afraid to launch on rtf plus dragon cant eject like ublisterduck said
spacex,not_removed,partially but also that a crs mission loss wouldnt be as big a blow to their reputation as perhaps another comsat would if lost government customer dragon produced internally as well as perhaps not wanting to upset nasa further with schedule delays perhaps their reasoning is that if they can launch more or less on time nasa will be more keen to offer them future contracts and keep crs going than if they significantly delayed it
spacex,not_removed,a dragon for iss resupply could be loaded with cargo that is cheap on earth like water and food it has greater value aboard the iss but if it were lost nasa would not be out much money and spacex would probably cover the cost of the booster and the capsule internally this is not standard space industry practice but elon once said something like when you buy a computer and it doesnt work you ship it back to the manufacturer and they give you a new one at spacex if your launch does not work we will give you a new launch for free or refund up to million whichever you prefer that is not a precise quote but it is the sense of the spacex guarantee
spacex,not_removed,just say mods next time and it lets them all know
spacex,not_removed,seems it was updated but to november not is that perhaps a typo
spacex,not_removed,december ish
spacex,not_removed,thats a really small sample size expand it back one year and spacex is then failures soyuz variants had three failures in the same time frame as did proton even that is still a relatively small sample size though
spacex,not_removed,only because not many protons launched in the last months
spacex,not_removed,youd be better using the data for all failures between when first launched for a paying customer and today
spacex,not_removed,no other rocket blew off the pad a loss during flight might be acceptable an explosion during static fire destroying the pad is not acceptable at all
spacex,not_removed,there was a of a chinese long march begin september as well of course the details were not made public
spacex,not_removed,thats been the schedule since before the failure though
spacex,not_removed,even if spacex clears themselves for flight by then wouldnt nasa want to do their own review of the findings and decide if they want cargo to fly again that review could take time i assume
spacex,not_removed,i mean seriously what are the chances of something going wrong at the pad pad failures are rare and yeseven for rockets
spacex,not_removed,i think there are several copvs in there already in any event changing the number of tanks and the pressure is a pretty large engineering change the rocket would have to be recertified to do that
spacex,not_removed,such a change is a substantial modification to the flight hardware probably not doable in this timeframe
spacex,not_removed,iridium likely is demanding spacex risk first in my opinion not because they fear the first set of birds being lost but because if the launch pad is damaged the other birds will be on the ground for likely over a year as will the share price for iridium because there there is little to no reserve left in the existing constellation however nothing is stopping spacex from simply putting a payload lacking falcon on the pad for testing in my opinion even if iridium is pissed it is better than risking on the first tanking test you cant test combined first and second stages in texas the good news for iridium is that means they can get their flight within a week or two of the rocket is already there and had its dress rehearsal it will simply need the payload and fairings attached
spacex,not_removed,i guess this was such a freak accident that it would be fine going forward for now with extra precautions
spacex,not_removed,not really it is theoretical justincasemiraclehappens date
spacex,not_removed,surviving the fall is the easy bit its surviving the landing that is hard
spacex,not_removed,going to tell you this right now nov will not hold dont get your hopes up in the slightest not only is this rtf it is from a that has not been used since the space shuttle oh and it is a crs flight that often gets delayed for reasons beyond spacexs control we will be very very lucky if we get to see this in november at all edit for the downvoters are you really this silly do you honestly believe a date for an rtf not officially announced on a crs flight on a new pad is going to launch on time how about instead of downvoting and moving on you give a reason why you are so confident that nov will hold
spacex,not_removed,its the first line of the article on a mission that would launch international space station supplies from kennedy space center so itll be
spacex,not_removed,it says a crs mission to iss
spacex,not_removed,do more people agree that they really know the cause already and probably knew a few seconds before the accident why do you think at all that they would have known anything before the accident
spacex,not_removed,yeah they did nov
spacex,not_removed,elon is commonly assumed to be working on martian years ie
spacex,not_removed,i have a theory that elon time is his time estimate if all of his employees were copies of him
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,i think musk has their own kind of
spacex,not_removed,theres a lot more to it than just rtf though they need get clearance to fly again true then they need a working pad they need a hangar ready to support rocket integration they need an open window with the range they need to get a customer to agree to fly they need that customer to have the payload ready they need to integrate the rocket they need to test a rocket on their new pad they need an acceptable launch window for the payload they need to attach the payload the customer needs to get their operations crew ready to go there are a lot of moving parts and the odds of all those stars aligning in the time frame spacex is targeting is aggressive to say the least not impossible but hard enough to cast some doubt on such an aggressive timeline
spacex,not_removed,its marginally more constructive than the usual which comes out in discussions like these that arent about spacex im not sure of its predictive power though something for rhighstakesspacex
spacex,not_removed,this is what worried or perhaps still worries people so much about proton which suffered a whole series of failures that are generally attributed to organizational issues like putting a gyroscope the wrong way
spacex,not_removed,i dont think a second pad loss is in anyway acceptable
spacex,not_removed,this assumes that no changes were made to the vehicle that precipitated this failure the and other rockets too has been in constant evolution since its first launch part suppliers get replaced optimizations are made etc
spacex,not_removed,various rupture failure modes of copvs are addressed during engineering design but the longerterm stress rupture failure mode is not well understood to date there have been no failures of copvs in flight or in flight systems on the ground that can be attributed to stress rupture but failures have been observed during testing at elevated stress conditions the relationship between these observed failures during test and flight vessel usage is not well understood but the result of a copv failure due to stress rupture would most likely lead to the loss of the spacecraft because the consequences of a stress rupture failure are significant better understanding is needed
spacex,not_removed,it would be another he feedline issue spacex has said that it only took milliseconds from the first sign of trouble to everything being turned into a flaming wreck a feedline failure most likely could not overpressurize the tank that fast especially when its not yet full
spacex,not_removed,much of the pressurized cargo is time sensitive and would absolutely be considered lost even if the dragon were to be successfully recovered seedlings stem cells mice etc that are used for science are brought up and back on most missions sample manifests here in fact most of the unpressurized cargo is what would be able to be reloaded on a subsequent flight see ida for example
spacex,not_removed,not so much that nasa can throw money away but rather that their payloads are not as expensive as communications satellites its expensive to get the supplies up there yes but a lot of it is consumables like food it has low material value
spacex,not_removed,strictly speaking this doesnt say that the cause hasnt been identified it very strongly implies it but if the cause wasnt obvious it could be known and the statement still be true
spacex,not_removed,i bet someone knows and theyll never fess up
spacex,not_removed,ill take it
spacex,not_removed,dragon is a fairly robust spacecraft there isnt all that much that needs to be left intact in one in order for the chutes to deploy after a rud sure it may sink once it splashes down but id expect it to splash down successfully after any rud where theres enough altitude to clear the fireball prior to chute deployment
spacex,not_removed,id categorize the dragon as having a passive abort capability in the event of a rud the dragon can release itself from the failing rocket and hopefully slide out of the way
spacex,not_removed,not completely unreliable but the explosion certainly lowered it a bit on the reliability scale this is also a brand new issue since the explosion occurred during fueling could be potentially very serious
spacex,not_removed,i wasnt trying to imply that became unreliable just throwing out possible reasons that i could think of if i didnt know why the last one exploded i dont know if i would want to put my nice shiny expensive sat on the first one back
spacex,not_removed,yes dollars wise the loss of tang tshirts and toilet paper might be lower than an expensive comm sat but there would be other negative consequences from losing another nasa mission political ones
spacex,not_removed,nice thats like the internet equivalent of yelling mom from your room i guess it makes sense automod triggers for a lot of other words to notify of bad behavior
spacex,not_removed,thanks didnt know that
spacex,not_removed,wasnt it either october or november cant remember
spacex,not_removed,i think it was httpspaceflightnowcomlaunchschedule
spacex,not_removed,soyuz failed i thought it was an extremely reliable vehicle
spacex,not_removed,and antares is still grounded following their launch failure
spacex,not_removed,you could have worded it differently but i agree a failure like this during fueling hasnt happened for a long time now i dont know enough to say if this is especially bad from a technical side of things but it is worrying
spacex,not_removed,no other rocket blew off the pad probably also no other rocket blew up for a wrongly installed gyroscope it is in the nature of faults that the same fault usually doesnt happen frequently
spacex,not_removed,no other rocket blew off the pad wrong there were other rockets that blowed up on pad granted that was decades ago but you didnt qualify that
spacex,not_removed,arent there nasa people on the board of inquiry that might make it possible for nasa to make a quick decision
spacex,not_removed,iirc nasa is part of the team that is investigating the rud
spacex,not_removed,considering that spacex may have no choice but to fix a copv that they do not fully understand the failure of significant on the first batch of missions and even if they managed to find something they suspect caused the system to fail there is the chance that it is not the true cause or the only cause and the only way to find out is to fix what you can and drag something out to the test stands and eventually the pad that means you have to expect a significantly higher chance of pad failure and if a pad is forced to endure such a failure on the first attempt it should be the vandy pad not there may be no good options for spacex to take just ones that cause the least amount of potential damage
spacex,not_removed,iridium launches from vandenberg
spacex,not_removed,youre probably not getting downvoted because people disagree its the rules after all its more likely that you sound gruff and abrasive in your comment ¯ツ¯ of course i dont think the date is set in stone its the mere fact that theyre comfortable saying that theyre targeting midnovember as their rtf that tells me theyre going to return to flight sooner rather than later even if the launch is scrubbed for a month thatd still allow rtf this year
spacex,not_removed,i thought nasa already delayed that to january before the anomaly
spacex,not_removed,there are sensors all over the rocket there are high speed cameras all over the rocket if there was any type of gas build up it should have been detected if there was any type of pressure loss it was detected well before the explosion but their would be almost nothing they could do about it except recycle they are being ridiculously confident if they really have no idea what happened talking about rtf this year if they really have no idea i dont think they would be predicting a rtf timetable my prediction is this is like the typical plane crash where minor and easily corrected multiple failure points in the rocket combined perhaps with a minor gse failure none of the failures individually would have led to rud so even though they were known well before nothing was done to correct them
spacex,not_removed,assuming this has been phrased the september roughly nov sept days days days sept days dec so in elon time that launch is targeted will as soon as dec
spacex,not_removed,maybe hes an alien from mars thats just trying to get home
spacex,not_removed,seems reasonable
spacex,not_removed,thats a good theory and one that is basically validated by his biography he also sometimes uses an accelerated time frame which is how long the project would take if the only constraints were the laws of physics
spacex,not_removed,so dragon flies in
spacex,not_removed,its usually closer to or martian years except for fh
spacex,not_removed,vandenberg is the only pad currently operational and iridium is desperate to get their polar birds up as their current constellation is falling apart onorbit perhaps this will be the rtf mission
spacex,not_removed,there are a lot of variables but spacex know how to do it they have done it already this is they rtf and they have much more experience by now
spacex,not_removed,and it wasnt just put in the wrong way it wasnt designed to drop in the wrong way there were actually holes that needed to be drilled in order to fit it the wrong way even
spacex,not_removed,i get what youre saying but the that isnt entirely true chance of pad loss isnt possible so if you adopt that attitude youll never get off the ground a second pad loss particularly and with successive failures would be a dissaster for spacex so on that front you are correct so the answer lies somewhere in between spacex has to find the point for the least risk possible while still being able to move forwards
spacex,not_removed,great i wonder if this means copv failures during reflight might be way more likely
spacex,not_removed,yes but the copvs hadnt even been flown yet ive reviewed nasas analysis of the copvs for the shuttle fleet and all of their concerns were focused on making sure the copvs would survive the number of flights expected of the orbitersnot that they would fail on the first use this is why i have serious reservations that it is a copv issueneed to look at the feedlines and other possible demarcation points of the system
spacex,not_removed,second stage in went catastrophic via the feedline copv didnt fail the extremely high pressure he got released uncontrollably via the feedline first getting jerked by the copv breaking free from its struts and then the feedline getting pinched off causing the he pressure in the feedline system to return to normal clearly that sequence was enough to overpressurize the lox tank to the failure point that all said there could be other demarcation points in the he system that may be better candidates to investigate fill attachment points valves etc every time you introduce another part to the system you increase the complexity and possible failure points
spacex,not_removed,well it takes days for dragon to rendezvous with iss and then another days to unpack based on crs trajectories of the first stage dragon would come down within a couple hundred km of shore at worst in a scenarioanything time sensitive would have a decent chance of being recovered in that scenario
spacex,not_removed,the unpressurized cargo would almost certainly be destroyed in a repeat even if dragon splashed down safely under parachutes the trunk where unpressurized cargo is mounted during flight has to be jettisoned before parachute deploy
spacex,not_removed,i dont think something like an ida would handle saltwater really well even with the protective wrapper
spacex,not_removed,seedlings stem cells mice etc that are used for science are brought up and back on most missions i believe the nasa could overcome the loss of those
spacex,not_removed,i know i was an idiot to make this bet but ive never contributed cash to reddit before and this will be fun
spacex,not_removed,dragon is a fairly robust spacecraft so much so that statistically it survived of in flight ruds to which it was exposed
spacex,not_removed,its suspected to be a copv issue the helium system was under full pressure during the test as far as that system was concerned it was in a very flightlike situation and spacex has had issues with helium for a long long time
spacex,not_removed,fairly certain they actually programmed it in its not automatic
spacex,not_removed,iirc it was around november
spacex,not_removed,soyuzfg which currently launches crewed missions and soyuzu the soon to be retired but mostused variant with over launches have excellent reliability records but the newer soyuz based rockets arent quite there yet theyre still very reliable but they had a few issues a while back not ruds but payload losses due to loss of communications and attitude control the progress spacecraft en route to the iss around the same time as the failure satellites placed into incorrect orbits due to freezing fuel lines or upper stages failing to deploy the satellites
spacex,not_removed,soyuz has also flown something like times of is still failures
spacex,not_removed,it is but it still has the odd failure here and there particularly on newer versions
spacex,not_removed,keep it mind it was also redesigned
spacex,not_removed,it is really expensive to fix the pad imagine if it was spacex s only pad it would have been a disaster
spacex,not_removed,i know that that is why iridium most likely does not want spacex to put a rocket on the pad in vandy until one launches from at the cape it is not even about the payload it is about the lengthy time a pad repair will take while their existing constellation is on its last legs and no time to change providers even if they could they were not happy when spacex delayed them a few weeks last time however i personally think is a horrible place to do the first postfailure tanking test
spacex,not_removed,is what echo hinted was moved to
spacex,not_removed,there are sensors all over the rocket interpreting what is going wrong is incredibly difficult and one cannot in general interpret that data very quickly at all the large number of sensors means that one has a better chance after the fact of figuring out what went wrong there are so many things that can go wrong one isnt going to know what happened in those first few seconds my prediction is this is like the typical plane crash where minor and easily corrected multiple failure points in the rocket combined perhaps with a minor gse failure none of the failures individually would have led to rud so even though they were known well before nothing was done to correct them what makes you think this
spacex,not_removed,they will launch on dec and if it blows up they can claim it was intentional
spacex,not_removed,well they are always
spacex,not_removed,years to stated date is year away rounding up so dragon flies in although personally i expect late or early
spacex,not_removed,read this as sea dragon at first glance kind of disappointed now
spacex,not_removed,yes except falcon heavy fh runs on ceres years
spacex,not_removed,source would love to read more
spacex,not_removed,whats so important about the pads are they expensive or hard to rebuild id expect that the loss of rocket payload is more severe
spacex,not_removed,they can swap copvs out without too much issue it could be one of the items needing replaced for reflight
spacex,not_removed,notice that spacex says the helium system ruptured and they dont know why and theyve eliminated all the obvious possibilities as quoted in the article now most people would say that if the copv ruptured then its an obvious possibility that the copv was defective but spacex says theyve eliminated the obvious possibilities which obviously includes the possibility that the copv was defective which means that possibility must have been eliminated so the copv apparently wasnt defective anyway the investigation has not reached a point that we can be confident that failure of the copv is the root cause for the explosion though we do know it was involved in the sequence of events that led to the loss of the rocket
spacex,not_removed,yeah but theyve been cycled several times for test firings its quite possible there was a small defect it doesnt take much for a copv to fail
spacex,not_removed,there was an argument in the original thread that even if there was a complete and instant clean break of the pipe entering the copv with helium rushing out of the bottle at full speed and the pumpedin helium russing out of the other part of the pipe then it would still be too slow to account for the expansion speed that was observed on the video it has to be the bottle it is just not obvious how andor why if blew up
spacex,not_removed,hadnt been flown but if i understand their test procedures correctly they had been cycled through flight pressure several times including static fire in texas
spacex,not_removed,yes but the failure took about longer you just cant spray he fast enough from a hose to have a failure
spacex,not_removed,it would be recovered yes but it would need to be put to active use in its time frame also if its not in space that wont happen so essentially still ruined regardless if recovered
spacex,not_removed,right but youre still at square one getting the science on orbit under the right conditions at the proper time anything recovered in that hypothetical isnt just going to be reloaded into the next capsule
spacex,not_removed,i think thats their point most of the cargo that isnt time sensitive would also be lost
spacex,not_removed,oh yes definitely i didnt mean to suggest that salvaging that cargo would be possible just saying that it comprises a greater ratio of things that are time sensitive
spacex,not_removed,the trunk would probably have to be jettisoned prior to or at apogee any later than that the capsule would probably experience some really bad instability as it and they fall into the atmosophere
spacex,not_removed,his point is that realistically nothing can be reused because unpressurized can be reused but cant be recovered and pressurized can be recovered but cant be reused
spacex,not_removed,haha i havent either this bet is one id be happy to lose i hope they rtf in november
spacex,not_removed,well survived the initial explosion yes i think saying it survived the entire rud is a bit of an overstatement considering the number of tiny bits the dragon is in
spacex,not_removed,the point is the anomaly didnt occur anywhere near the fuel storage tanks they still do not have a definitive idea of where and how the initial ignition occurred helium doesnt just explode like that unless there was a structural issue which is why it could potentially be very bad news to the falcon rocket family itself
spacex,not_removed,soyuzu the soon to be retired but mostused variant with over launches im a bit upset about that if their new manned spacecraft gets off the ground we could see the death of the booster and core design and i really like that rocket design
spacex,not_removed,yes but only because they decided it was needed after having a launch failure so still relevant
spacex,not_removed,i still find it crazy that the pads are so complex and difficult to construct it seems to me like theyre really overengineered for whats necessary but hell what do i know
spacex,not_removed,i am making assumptions not from any information but from the attitude of musk and space x i have seen this type of attitude before from clients and other parties to lawsuits or potential lawsuits i was a legal investigator and worked on hundreds of auto accidents and plane accidents in my career i am of course completely guessing and reading between the linesbut it seems to me spacex is being rather coy about this whole incident that suggests to me they know pretty much what happened and that it was probably not even their fault that could be wishful thinking however the rtf date was a big clue to my assumption the information we have been given smacks of litigants to a claim who are lawyered up to the neck and are being told to shut up by the attorneys second when musk talks about the complexity of the investigation this suggests to somebody who has seen every episode of why planes crash that there are multiple causes more than very unlikely and easily correctedevents happened one of which would not have caused rud but togetherboom again just speculating but i am taking bets there are so many things that can go wrong one isnt going to know what happened in those first few seconds how many things can cause a sudden brilliant flash followed by kaboom the rud followed a very specific pattern of events albeit compressed into a second or less
spacex,not_removed,i dont think you really needed to explain what you meant
spacex,not_removed,the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiseadragonrocket would have allegedly exceeded its in size thrust and payload to leo
spacex,not_removed,this link basically says it the improper installation apparently required some considerable physical effort almost seems that it had to be intentional how could someone be so ignorant
spacex,not_removed,i read this about years ago will try to dig it up tomorrow
spacex,not_removed,pads are actually hugely expensive and difficult to build so much so that spacex isnt building this pad from scratch and are using and upgrading it the biggest problem isnt the cost in this case its what happens when you blow up the pad you put that pad out of commission for months while it needs repairs for this architecture that means no refueling flights which means you could very well totally miss your launch window in the future when there is a second pad location in texas this wont be a big problem in the case of a pad loss the second pad can still launch tankers at the start it ruins the whole launch window even if you are out of launches into fueling the spacecraft
spacex,not_removed,the soviet launch failure was one of the largest nonnuclear explosions in human history the its has the gross liftoff mass of the a failure would turn the pad to rubble
spacex,not_removed,the difficulty will be if its deemed copvs are not worth the risk and the tanks need converted to a different construction not all rockets use copv for their he storage
spacex,not_removed,how easy is it arent they inside the lox tank
spacex,not_removed,it could be that if copvs fail for no reason sometimes ie even when not obviously defective its pretty difficult to pin down the cause of the failure ie copv failure might not itself be considered a root cause
spacex,not_removed,i was about to inquire about this as it has been on my mind for a while in my opinion in basic we can rule out copv failure as it really would seem to fit under the obvious category helium plumbing is on my mind
spacex,not_removed,do we really know that im sure within spacex they must know if a feed line or manifold rupture could cause failure in milliseconds but i dont think any of us outsiders really have access to that level of knowledge perhaps you are a spacex employee who is here incognito
spacex,not_removed,well if you decide to include all subsequencial consequences of the rud in it then yes it did not survive the rud but then youd have to say that rud caused my blood pressure to drop my heart rate to rise and an argument with my wife i prefer to consider dragon didnt survive its high velocity encounter with the ocean
spacex,not_removed,if the helium bottle burst the resulting pressure would very likely have ruptured the lox tank by that time very little extra is needed to light the entire thing
spacex,not_removed,theres still soyuz
spacex,not_removed,yeah considering the amount of equipment needed to support
spacex,not_removed,investigators sifting through the wreckage found critical angular velocity sensors dus installed upside down each of those sensors had an arrow that was suppose to point toward the top of the vehicle however multiple sensors on the failed rocket were pointing downward instead the paper trail led to a young technician responsible for the wrong assembly of the hardware it appeared that no visual control of the faulty installation had been conducted while electrical checks could not detect the problem since all circuits had been working correctly a total of three bdg modules are mounted on a special platform on the body of the rocket all three bdgs responsible for the course yaw axis were rotated degrees since all three bdgs had been installed incorrectly the threechannel flight control system could not filter out faulty data by comparing it to correct information coming from the majority of sensors the improper installation apparently required some considerable physical effort which somehow did not raise any alarm at gknpts khrunichevs assembly plant in moscow investigators immediately looked at already assembled protons including those in baikonur but did not find such an anomaly wow just wow the technician defeated two layers of mistake proofing arrow and mounting hardware and bypassed a tripleredundant safety system and the test equipment couldnt detect the error that is a malicious level of idiocy
spacex,not_removed,in somebody explains that the russian design manufacturing process was very different from in the us instead of designers producing precise specifications that manufacturers would bend over backwards to recreate perfectly in russia the people building it would often take the technical drawings as guidelines because they knew more about how things worked in the real world could be that someone on the factory floor decided to show some initiative when the gyroscope wouldnt fit the way it was supposed to
spacex,not_removed,i recall reading about a series of crashes in chuck yeagers autobiography of the that were eventually traced to some old geezer on the assembly line whose job was to rivet on the aileron actuator attachment point a redesign of the actuator had resulted in the attachment point being repositioned degrees different old geezer got the new engineering drawings decided those idiots got the bracket backwards and kept attaching them the same way as before which resulted in control lockup under certain conditions all it takes is one stupid guy who knows hes right despite what the drawing says
spacex,not_removed,how could someone be so ignorant this launch vehicle must be completed before the deadline i dont care what you have to do to make it happen
spacex,not_removed,especially since there are manuals for everything
spacex,not_removed,shamelessly plugging my own comment there were no extra holes drilled in this accident but ive heard of something like that could be an urban legend though
spacex,not_removed,do some rockets use entirely seperate tanks for that
spacex,not_removed,pretty sure there are hatches they can open to get inside i know theyve changed them at the launch site before
spacex,not_removed,it could have been a defect in the composite a void filled with resin would not be obvious in most composite ndi techniques i am familiar with just enough weakness that the bottle passed its initial hydrostatic testing but that test severely weakend the defect after a few more cryo cycles it unknowingly degraded to the point of rupture as the composite is the strength of the container and the liner is just to seal the container it is a distinct possibility it was just a single bad bottle assuming that it was the copv i am an aircraft mechanic and you would be suprised how many supposedly certified new and refurbished parts we get bad from stock qa from parts manufacturers in aviation can be pretty awful makes me wonder if thats the case here if it was truly the copv would a modification by adding extra bottles to reduce the pressure held by them be a better solution than replacing the bottles with a more traditional heavier metal bottle what impact would the extra weight if metal bottles have versus the slight reduction in tank volume and slight weight increase of extra bottles would better qainspection techniques find defective bottles and prevent another mishap will risk be acceptable until it is adressed and removed in
spacex,not_removed,hahaha no no im not it would be nice to have a job where i was contributing to something amazing im a software guy it was listed in something they wrote dont require if it was on their website or something elon said but they pointed to it being easy to see the difference between the two anomalies because the sensors could see the changes happening over a half second for but this ruptured so quickly their sensors telemetry cut out pretty much instantly think of it this way the copv is designed to be strong around the outlet on the bottlea loose fitting or cut hose isnt going to cause the copv to explode its going to let the helium out as fast as it can get through the hole causing the bottle to go flying when a copv explodes its because the carbon fiber delaminates in a small spot causing a gap between it and the pressure vessel with the pressure vessel instantly bursts as the metal itself cant hold the pressure and blows the whole vessel apart and shrapnel goes everywhere hence the fuel and oxygen tanks rupturing and sensors being lost all at the same time instead of a slow measurable progression
spacex,not_removed,that just goes back to the original anomaly what caused the breach in the helium system this is not a typical failure which are usually the result of errors in launch ignition as you well know people are treating this as if it was when its pretty clear to me that this is something very serious
spacex,not_removed,to be fair that was something like tons vs still there must be a lot more going on there than i realize because its not that hard to support a ton structure i mean you look at it and it seems simple enough rails a pad of concrete the flame trenches presumably some pilings punched into the ground to support the load of the fully fueled craft aside from the strongback none of that seems like it needs any serious engineering or insanely special requirements like i said i just dont get it im sure theres a reason though
spacex,not_removed,a common problem encountered when designing something completely foolproof is underestimating the ingenuity of complete fools
spacex,not_removed,there is an old russian joke about this americans steal the designs for the newest russian interceptor they follow the plans perfectly recreating all the parts and assembling them exactly as instructed and get a train after doing that a few times americans go and smuggle out a chief engineer from the factory that made the plane he looked at the plans looked at the result and said well it clearly says here on the plans file off the unnecessary bits
spacex,not_removed,to be fair sometime engineers make mistakes and production catches it but also to be fair he should have raised a flag and double checked
spacex,not_removed,the story as i remember it was that the old mechanic servicing the wings put in the attachment bolts for the aileron linkages according to established aircraft standards which was and is bolt head on top nut on bottom you can see how this makes sense in most cases because if the nut comes off gravity will still hold the bolt in position in the however there was a clearance issue due to flexing of the wings in highg flight if the bolts were put in in the standard way everything would be fine in level flight but in a high g turn or when pulling out from a dive the wings would flex the bolts would contact a spar or the wing skin and the ailerons could not move resulting in several crashes of airplanes shortly after they had been serviced there were no flight recorders back then and when the planes crashed while the pilots were practicing aerobatic maneuvers generally all the information the pilots gave was a string of curses before hitting the ground a few seconds later so yeager was given a plane with the same service history as the ones that crashed and told to duplicate the problem preferably without dying he cautiously tried all the things the plane was supposed to do takeoffs landings slow flight fast flight and finally high speed dives where he discovered the controls seized up while pulling out so he eased off on the gs and pulled out very gently and then had the plane disassembled to discover why the ailerons locked up after the upside down bolts were discovered the mechanic freely admitted that he had put them in the right way and not the way the manual said to
spacex,not_removed,ive seen this so many times already and i havent even properly started my career rushing to get a job done almost guarantees the job being done badly
spacex,not_removed,they as far as i know still get stored inside the lox typically but can be solid metal spherical tanks or the fancy looking he tanks used on ariane there may be other options im not aware of
spacex,not_removed,if we go back to and the fact that the only nonspacex investigator didnt sign the mishap report we can suppose that there could be a manufacturing or qa problem with their production of copvs which under certain circumstances fail explosively this is just speculation though and yeah they seem to be the only launch provider who have so many problems with the helium system the strange thing is that these rockets went through a full static fire before they test as they fly yet something apparently isnt being caught in mcgregor
spacex,not_removed,i have a feeling that if spacex had built the pad from scratch it would have been somewhat simpler
spacex,not_removed,never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity on december the upper stage and payloads failed to reach orbital velocity due to overloading of the upper stage with tonnes of liquid oxygen resulting in the loss of three glonass satellites it was carrying i cant even on second thought malice shouldnt be ruled out the scale of corruption in russia is such that the exploded satellites could have been fakes with the money to build them stolen
spacex,not_removed,im pretty sure its not some russian soviet production require lite modification with heavy hammer to work properly that develop bad habit to fix things
spacex,not_removed,production misunderstanding drawings is an issue that comes up a fair bit as a draughtsman ive always been told to try and make my drawings idiot proof doesnt always work though
spacex,not_removed,yes thats the story thanks for retelling it couldnt remember and no way i could find my year old copy of yeager to look it up and the internet wasnt helping me
spacex,not_removed,not only that but a work atmosphere where youre given a look of disappointment when asking questions will subtly drive workers to not ask if theyre not sure of something once a culture of its bad to be seen not knowing things is established and i think its often established in homes long before the workplace it can be difficult to change that mindset
spacex,not_removed,ariane uses lowpressure liquid helium though
spacex,not_removed,i suppose thats a possibility well have to see what its like at their facility in texas
spacex,not_removed,ahh didnt realize that it wasnt hot gaseous he interesting
spacex,not_removed,it is heated by the engine like but just stored differently
spacex,not_removed,i was reading the entry on the spacex the first first stage recovered on the barge and elon said theyd run some test fires to determine this specific stages re usability the last line in the wiki article was aiming for a june reuse i dont follow spacex closely so i thought this would be a good place to find the answer thanks
spacex,not_removed,hi your submission was removed from rspacex for breaking our httpwwwredditcomrspacexwikirules submit in a thread if one exists please post simple questions to the ask anything questions thread thanks for understanding this is so we can keep rspacex the very best spacex discussion board on the internet if you feel this removal was made in error please about the removal of my submission
spacex,not_removed,two things first the ask anything thread at the top of the subreddit wouldve been a great place to post this and im sure youll shortly be redirected there by a mod second i think the latest news is that they took the stage back to mcgregor tx for testing instead of just firing it at ksc like they did with the last one and as far as we know they should be reflying a stage sometime before the end of this year but thats scheduled like all other spacex plans with margins for slipping edit httpredditcomrspacexwikicores along with the new ground test qualification booster is the one that went back to mcgregor for testing there should be two cores in the hif
spacex,not_removed,sorry about that i saw it and saw it was days old and thought nobody will see this but looking through it now i see responses to questions from the last hours so ill admit you guys know what youre doing
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,will they really jettison the nosecone i hadnt heard that before this but it makes sense
spacex,not_removed,jettison nosecone interesting
spacex,not_removed,awesome where did you get this
spacex,not_removed,looks like a fullysolar finless trunk if were to believe the slide pictures
spacex,not_removed,i am less interested in the nosecone being jettisoned and more interested in the trunk falcon heavy is powerful enough to launch a pretty full dragon to mars which means the trunk does not necessarily have to be empty i could imagine a small satellite being deployed from the trunk or even the trunk itself being used as it seems unlike spacex to waste such an opportunity a small satellite should be able to provide sufficient delta v to get captured in orbit i imagine its only a question of time until launchresource allocation
spacex,not_removed,that appears to confirm no option for any trunk payloads in mars orbit unless they are entirely selfcontained eg carry their own fuel and propulsion system for capture possible for flyby or impactor tuck a hiad in there missions to be carried though
spacex,not_removed,does this provide evidence of a dragon that berths and thus has a jettisonable nosecone or is it a custom dragon with a custom nosecone
spacex,not_removed,is there any talk about the return sample mission possible used in conjunction with the rover
spacex,not_removed,to be honest this leaves allot of information left out like are the boosters and center core going to be recovered or is it launching in an expendable mode drone ship or rtl how close will the rocket be to orbit after boosters separate how many burns will the second stage do one to get into orbit one for circulation one for earth depature

spacex,not_removed,are they actually launching a dragon capsule or are they planning to send a similarly sized roberover also have they sketched out any plans for what a roundtrip vessel would look like
spacex,not_removed,is there anything stopping them from putting a small rover in the red dragon that could roll off after landing and go do its thing
spacex,not_removed,whats a thermal roll tried googling it couldnt find the relevant info
spacex,not_removed,true
spacex,not_removed,all candidate edl architectures require supersonic retro propulsion is there some sort of official list of nasas candidate edl architectures ive seen tons of designs that dont call for it and i am still not convinced it is the best way for landing large mass payloads
spacex,not_removed,offers flight technology demonstration of critical edl technologies needed for human exploration in the mars atmosphere about a decade sooner and at a fraction of the cost to nasa for a future technology demonstrator mission the benefit of private enterprise leading the way in the space sector concisely put
spacex,not_removed,every dragon flight does this actually its only needed when going up through the atmosphere
spacex,not_removed,they jettison the dragon nosecone too early in orbit the dragon renders show a foldedback nosecone when attached to the iss but since they arent worried about reusability with the red dragon getting rid of any excess weight is a good idea the nose cone is only needed for aerodynamic purposes during launch
spacex,not_removed,perhaps they are looking to put something there that requires the nose cone to be removednot sure what the mass advantage would be of ditching it
spacex,not_removed,jettison nosecone interesting i think thats standard procedure on dragon missions to shed a bit of mass after second stage startup but before the full second stage burn is complete its roughly equivalent to fairing separation on a regular falcon mission its just that the dragon does not have much of a fairing the capsule is so strong that it does not require fairing
spacex,not_removed,screen grab from nasa advisory council technology innovation and engineering committee meeting via cisco webex
spacex,not_removed,presumably to make up for the inversesquare law
spacex,not_removed,not an expert but the trajectory is likely to be a direct entry approach not into orbit considerable fuel would then be required to put anything into orbit as to mass of the spacecraft the dragon is likely to contain quite a large fuel load i would imagine additional tanks may be located where passengers and cargo might otherwise go this could allow for extra decel and hover time since the dynamics of landing a heavy ship are not yet thoroughly understood all speculation on my part
spacex,not_removed,the trunk will be full of fuel and some superdraco thrusters to conduct the first retropulsive maneuver before jettisoning i think dragon simply doesnt seem large enough to make the retropulsive deceleration from to kms on its own reference
spacex,not_removed,yes and such a satellite would likely be a com sat so it already has solar arrays and hall thrusters it would just take a few kg of sep fuel and a long time for braking but if released from the trunk early or if riding as a secondary on the second stage it has plenty of time the limit would be fh capacity fully expendable it has plenty but they want to at least recover the side boosters i really have no idea how much capacity they will have for throwing mass it depends on the actual landed payload inside dragon too if they dont have much there is plenty of capacity if they max out dragon payload with whatever they put in even ballast the capacity for extra payload to mars is limited
spacex,not_removed,way too complicated dragon is landing best use for the trunk if weight allows it is a mars satellite
spacex,not_removed,the dragon capsule is probably not even be capable of entering mars orbit without either aerocapture which would require ditching the trunk or extra propulsion
spacex,not_removed,considering red dragon will be customized for a mars mission including the custom trunk its not unreasonable to think they will jettison the nosecone to save mass
spacex,not_removed,wy circularization there is no need direct departure would be most efficient but a separate departure burn may help with precision at some recent event elon musk has said they land the side boosters they are not sure if they can land the central core honestly i am very surprised they even consider the central core
spacex,not_removed,are they actually launching a dragon capsule or are they planning to send a similarly sized roberover they are sending a slightly modified red dragon capsule also have they sketched out any plans for what a roundtrip vessel would look like elon is unveiling his mars colonization plans in september they may mention a round trip dragon mission at that time just a guess
spacex,not_removed,dragon capsule thats the whole point of the mission using nearly offtheshelf hardware instead of a missionspecific vehicle to most economically test retropropulsive martian atmospheric entry this fall spacex is scheduled to unveil the roundtrip capable bfrmct architecture
spacex,not_removed,crew dragondragon was designed from the start to be able to land on mars or any other solid surface in the solar system this will be a first test of that design at mars thus all the edl entry descent and landing references in the slides nasa has run the numbers and think it can work but has a better chance if they partner nasa gets edl data back for a cost of which is insanely cheap considering that the substantially smaller curiosity rover cost
spacex,not_removed,the rover itself would be a significant separate undertaking it would introduce considerable schedule risk
spacex,not_removed,mostly just time and resources getting this mission ready to go by will be pretty tough as is and a financial loss as well putting together a rover of any size would be an expensive distraction for spacex i wouldnt be surprised to see something like that as a paid government payload aboard a red dragon in or later though
spacex,not_removed,it is the process of puting a slight rolling motion on a spacecraft to managed the uneven heating because the sun only shine at one side of the spacecraft
spacex,not_removed,the other option is increasing the drag coefficient enough for sub sonic propulsive landing but this adds more weightchutes or inflatable heat shields you may aswell just use the extra weight for fuel and start your landing burn earlier during supersonic flight
spacex,not_removed,dragon will have a retractable nosecone though to stay on the entire time
spacex,not_removed,but red dragon is based on dragon which has a recoverable nosecone
spacex,not_removed,mission science sensors andor telecommunications instrumentation would find a convenient location there
spacex,not_removed,yeah i know was just wondering because they showed a hinged nosecone in renders probably to get all the mass they can get in red dragon was just thinking about the extra complication it brings to replace the hinged nosecone with a jettisonable one
spacex,not_removed,i gotta get on that webex
spacex,not_removed,a little ot but can we expect a press kit prior to launch
spacex,not_removed,its for the thermal roll so it can have fulltime solar during coast
spacex,not_removed,you could go for aerocapture
spacex,not_removed,why kms the arrival speed for a regular hohman mission is way lower and theres no reason for the red dragon to hurry in fact optimum energy is desirable here to maximize the payload which is the competitive advantage of a fhred dragon mission compared to other means of delivery
spacex,not_removed,the gto performance of fh is around tonnes by recovering all cores around tonnes by recovering only the boosters doesnt seem enough for the red dragon mission so i guess all cores will splash in the ocean
spacex,not_removed,best use for the trunk if weight allows it is a mars satellite the problem is dragon detaches the trunk before it performs any propulsive manoeuvres or aerobraking the trunk arrives at mars at interplanetary velocities with no way to slow down
spacex,not_removed,have to put a full secondary fuel system in there though and a deployable antenna for comms which adds mass to the entire system and then you run into the issue of you might exceed the earth launch capabilities
spacex,not_removed,i was also wondering why they explicitly mention nosecone jettisoning while glossing over a lot of other standard procedures i therefore presume that the nosecone jettisoning a mission specific detail and not a regular thing
spacex,not_removed,they may mention a round trip dragon mission at that time just a guess its possible they might pursue a very small sample return mission at some point perhaps with nasa designing and paying for the mission including designing the return vehicle which would ride inside red dragon but just to be clear to anyone who doesnt know red dragon vehicles are nowhere near capable of getting from mars surface to earth
spacex,not_removed,someone should suggest that elon plaster ads on the red dragon capsule they can post a few micro cams or something if needed that should pay for the cost of the mission maybe nbc would pay for a ad for one of their sci fi shows
spacex,not_removed,too bad it would be cool if they would at least consider something like putting together a simple sojournerlike rover or using an existing engineering model even cooler would be if theyd make it a challenge project for a university engineering program it looks like all spacex would have to do is make a platform with a release mechanism and some kind of extendable ramp something that would unroll out the hatch for the rover to go down
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,spacex also showed video of the falcon second stage making a powered landing theyve since abandoned that they may have changed their mind on the retractable nosecone as well
spacex,not_removed,its been speculated that they would do a cbm variant of dragon since theres less clearance with a cbm attachment i dont think theyd be able to keep the nose cone attached and the entire top of the capsule will probably have to be different anyway if all of this is true perhaps the red dragon capsule will have more in common with the cbm dragon than the docking version
spacex,not_removed,the dragon nosecone is saved because the dragon is reusable the red dragon isnt i see absolutely no upside to keeping the nosecone even if it means a small change in design to the dragon and compared to the other changes the red dragon needs ejecting the nosecone is the least of their worries
spacex,not_removed,theres probably an option to jettison the nose cone of crew dragons too in the event of a failure to close after undocking for example it would be safer to reenter without it rather than have it disturbing the aerodynamics by flapping around unpredictably speaking of aerodynamics one of the reasons besides reusability for the hinged cone on may be for a smoother ride through earths atmosphere aerodynamics are less relevant in mars low atmosphere and every bit of mass saved helps
spacex,not_removed,i see i misunderstood your comment perhaps its just an old rendering based on an older dragon version or they changed plans and simplified the dragon or as you suggest they are doing a oneoff for red dragon to maximize science downmass
spacex,not_removed,dragon has a retractable nose cone for reusability its that much less you have to do to refurbish it this particular red dragon isnt going to be reused so there is no need to save the nose cone
spacex,not_removed,out of curiosity would it actually be possible for any civilian not involved in these projects to get onto a webcast like this as an observer or do you have some kind of inside route you could employ
spacex,not_removed,for what red dragon probably your asking a couple of years early though
spacex,not_removed,that too but the decreased power near au also makes that a requirement
spacex,not_removed,apollo did this on the way to the moon it was called rotisserie or barbecue mode various sources mention either one or three rotations per hour
spacex,not_removed,its really not going to be doing much that uses power while its coasting
spacex,not_removed,maybe would require extra hardware and careful aim likely not time to develop a platform that could do it i still bet they go for carrying as much fuel as possible
spacex,not_removed,isnt kms the escape velocity from earth httpsenwikipediaorgwikiescapevelocity
spacex,not_removed,when he was asked elon musk said he does not know yet if they can recover the central core but certainly the boosters honestly i have no idea how central core recovery would be possible but with maybe of reddragon to tmi the boosters should be very doable another data given was more than to tmi that too would point to more than to tmi with side booster recovey
spacex,not_removed,could possibly make for an interesting payload as a flyby one more camera with an antenna floating out in the solar system those solar panels arent going to just stop functioning after dragon leaves thats a good bit of power and plenty of space for an antenna which it presumably also already has just judge it out of the way of mars and with a small amount of fuel possibly do a visual asteroid flyby
spacex,not_removed,if they eject it from the trunk early enough a mars reconnaissance orbiterlike satellite could raise its periapsis and then burn into orbit or multiple small satellites
spacex,not_removed,indeed it would be a case of the pressure vessel containing a hypergolic rocket capable of putting a tiny sample onto a collision course with earth or meeting up with an orbiting interplanetary bus acting as a missile silo
spacex,not_removed,it also might be possible that because this is a red dragon mission which wont be coming back spacex decided to eject the nose cone to lower the mass of the vehicle
spacex,not_removed,youre right they mightve but i dont see why they wouldve its not a super complex issue like landing a second stage
spacex,not_removed,does the red dragon even need a docking port
spacex,not_removed,and another reason not to ditch it protection of a docking port since is potentially fully reusable and docking end should be more intricate filled with automatic docking systems sensors and mechanics
spacex,not_removed,the opening mechanism might not work under gravity it is designed to work in space
spacex,not_removed,yeah theyre public and anyone can watch heres the info you need the webex link is on there i caught only the last slide
spacex,not_removed,i asked bc that graphic in the post seemed press kit standard
spacex,not_removed,red dragon should receive like times less power when near mars right
spacex,not_removed,im sorry but what increase in power removing fins reuces solar power half the cylinder is not producing because of shade
spacex,not_removed,reducing charge cycles on batteries is one way to increase mtbf plus who knows what hardware theyll carry and what kind of power needs itll have i mean those martian bitcoins wont calculate themselves
spacex,not_removed,but youd have to custombuild the satellite anyway its not like theres some readily available satellite bus to fit rds custom trunk
spacex,not_removed,it may be but what does that figure have to do with martian arrival deltav requirements curiosity for example had to brake down from only something like kms
spacex,not_removed,mass carried in the trunk still needs to be boosted to mars transfer by the tanstaafl this might only be barely an option and even then for just the lightest of red dragons
spacex,not_removed,also as uoccupuduna mentioned they might not have abandoned it for crew dragon but might for red dragon where mass is more critical i just wouldnt take anything as set in stone because it was in an early animation
spacex,not_removed,only reason i can think of is reliability apollo had problems with the sla opening up then bouncing back so they moved to a design where the panels detached fully instead
spacex,not_removed,its not super complex but its a lot more complex then just jettisoning it and it doesnt even cost that much to make a new one plus it adds a major failure point what if the nose cone wont open then they cant dock and the mission is essentially over or what if it wont close and it fucks up reentry
spacex,not_removed,the purpose of keeping the nose cone is to protect the docking unit so the it can be reused the docking unit has some pretty delicate parts not all of which would survive reentry without some protection red dragon is a useonce mission the mass of the nose cone is a penalty on a use once mission unless it is needed to protect solar cells or some other delicate structure
spacex,not_removed,no but under the nose cone is the most obvious place to position any scientific sensorscommunications instrumentation spacex and nasa decide to send
spacex,not_removed,no but it will have roughly similar structure to the standard dragon and the size of the docking port will dictate how that structure looks
spacex,not_removed,thanks i guess i should expect if any government agency is using technology to efficently share information it would be nasa still blows my mind i guess i have spent too much time at my local department of motor vehicles office to have any faith in government tech savvy
spacex,not_removed,er what i dont understand your question out at mars the solar intensity is far less it takes more solar panels to get the same bang for your buck ergo red dragons distance from the sun means it requires more power even if the spacecraft werent tumbling in transit
spacex,not_removed,youre right mars is not a stationary target it has some speed on its own so the atmospheric interface velocity of red dragon can be as little as some kms anyway i think the trunk will be the stage of the landing burn
spacex,not_removed,i know its not free but back of the envelope math suggests theres some mass available there spacex advertises a capability for on tmi dragon masses are a little harder to come by especially for the unknown of red dragon but wikipedia lists a dry mass of for dragon that leaves available for payload even assuming some fuzziness on red dragon design tweaks of propellants and some scientific payload to the surface well it still seems believable they could fit something mrolike fueled in the trunk granted an mrotwin may be too large for the trunk but a smaller satellite is likely even lighter and we dont need another mro something smaller that just provided a faster uplink andor greater signal coverage for spacex could be a help or get a higher power camera up there so spacex can do their own imagery on possible landing sites at higher resolutions
spacex,not_removed,but what it you design it to jettison and it doesnt youre right jettisoning does seem somewhat simpler than retracting but theres always a failure point im pretty confident spacex can design a robust retractable nosecone system and if it wont open or close just jettison it as a last resort
spacex,not_removed,yes and i would expect these instruments to be protected during edl this is a nasa presentation not from spacex and i would not be surprised if a minor mistake slips in they know the nosecone is ejected in cargo dragon and presented it that way they may just have missed the design change in dragon or the opening mechanism is designed for space and could not open on mars under gravity and that is why they jettison it it could be correct but it may be a mistake
spacex,not_removed,the far side is facing away from the sun puting panels on the far side of the trunk does not increase collection area just the area of panels is increased for the rotation thing just because the far side of the moon shines doesnt make the moonshine in your eye brighter to increase collecting power they would have needed larger fins not removing fins or longer trunk
spacex,not_removed,i read somewhere that the main issue is with upstream they have hirise but only of surface is sent back to earth
spacex,not_removed,but what it you design it to jettison and it doesnt they might have a crowbar on iss
spacex,not_removed,the spacecraft will be in a thermal control roll if half the trunk has panels they will be exposed to sunlight half the time if all the trunk has panels each individual one will be exposed half the time but the power generated will double
spacex,not_removed,im half expecting spacex to use the dsn for the first flight and quickly start dropping their own relays and offering bandwidth back to nasa to upgrade the bottlenecks
spacex,not_removed,why would they roll it im pretty sure ive seen sources indicating that the nonsolarpanelcovered side has integrated radiators making a thermal roll pointless edit yeup dragon trunk already has this capability the trunk also houses the radiator which is integral to the trunk structure with the ability to reject up to of heat i dont see why they wouldnt do this with dragon trunk as well
spacex,not_removed,interesting info maybe it would be lighter or cooling system isnt yet able to function for such a long mission
spacex,not_removed,radiators are to get rid of excess heat they roll the spacecraft to heat it evenly else side gets really hot and the other side gets really cold thermal contractionexpansion would cause a lot of stress on the spacecraft same reason you turn sausages on the bbq else side becomes charcoal and the other side is raw
spacex,not_removed,wow your animation is even better this time i suscribed to your channel also the different versions of the its are awesome
spacex,not_removed,nice video slight mistake i noticed during a launch abort dragon takes the finned trunk with it
spacex,not_removed,great explanation with excellent animation i really didnt like seeing dragon on top of that falcon explosion though
spacex,not_removed,very nice explanation i liked the last image with the its in the nasa russian chinese jaxa and esa colors
spacex,not_removed,this is a great truth that for each type of work there are some people and resources in world and we must not forget about the exploration of other worlds in spite of the difficulties on the earth
spacex,not_removed,i just wanted to say this video is by uthefrek he hadnt posted it here so i did sorry for any confusion
spacex,not_removed,very nice but i preferred your previous animation i thought it had better pacing and a more consistent colour theme and style most of this is very high level but covers a lot for someone unfamiliar with spacex mars colonization i think it might get a skeptical reaction i could be wrong though i just want to give some potential feedback its a great recap imo
spacex,not_removed,these would make some great wallpapers could i get a wallpaper of the different bfr liveries at
spacex,not_removed,my favorite part was countries and organizations all over the world having their own versions of the its and expanding their activities in space
spacex,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters last usagebig falcon rocket see its last usageeuropean space agency last usageinterplanetary transport system see mct last usagejapan aerospace exploration agency mctmars colonial transporter see its jargondefinition last usagereaction between hydrogen and carbon dioxide at high temperature and pressure with nickel as catalyst yielding methane and water decronym is a community product of rspacex implemented im a bot and i first saw this thread at oct utc ive seen acronyms in this thread has acronyms httpdecronymxyz httpsredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
spacex,not_removed,making some really great points i think what people often forget is how feasible the whole plan actually is in the big picture it is not whether spacex will be immediately successful in all its envisioned goals on its first try but setting the first step in learning and trying this necessity of interplanetary space travel what we will learn from both the sucesses and failures in these first attempts will be quintessential in ensuring our future regardless of whether it will be mainly on earth or elsewhere props for the video josh hope you keep it up
spacex,not_removed,as a computer science student i was surprised to see programmer on the list of jobs in high demand on mars while id love there to be a market for my skills there in the future that seems like the one job that could be completed remotely
spacex,not_removed,great overview i think this is an awesome video to show those who dont follow things as closely as most of us here but are curious as to what is going on
spacex,not_removed,great video i will say though that saying spacexs success rate is only lower than the industry standard vs is a little misleading you could easily flip it around and say that spacexs failure rate is the industry standard vs which is significantly less flattering i think in this case the failure rate is probably the more important statistic
spacex,not_removed,an excellent easy intro to musks mars plans small error on your radiation risk narrative the trip will not take months it will take from to months dont think that invalidates your point that it is not all that long though also liked your inclusion of phobos and deimos in your mars surface time lapse animations nice touch that
spacex,not_removed,erm the sabatier reaction is backwards it httpwwwkurzweilainetahighefficiencysustainableprocessusingsolarandcarbondioxidetoproducemethanefornaturalgas whereas this video states that it the exothermic part is the reverse reaction the one that happens when the methane is burned in a rocket
spacex,not_removed,good overview liked the animation
spacex,not_removed,great video it would be a nice thing if you gave updates in the future when you have a lot more subscribers so people keep the interest in space exploration
spacex,not_removed,this is an excellent video
spacex,not_removed,this is a fantastic animation i particularly loved the little guy jumping around in and a great summary of the its system to boot well done sir
spacex,not_removed,the trip to mars in elons plan would not only last about two months like the video incorrectly states try months also thats probably not the optimal trip length you could get more crew and cargo to mars with a longer trip length as individuals like robert zubrin have already pointed out about musks plan if youre going to spend the rest of your life on mars its probably going to be much more important that you can get a sufficiently cheap ticket to purchase lots of payload capacity for cargo to go with you to mars for longterm survival on the planet than that you shave a month or two off the journey a longer trip shaves fuel requirements per ton of payload off at both ends of the trip ejection and capture allowing you to carry more payload to mars with the same amount of fuel and same size fuel tanks
spacex,not_removed,how many and fh launches a year will spacex have to do to make billion in annual profit in order to earn billion development costs for its
spacex,not_removed,tickets might be to i live in california so when i heard that the price would be about the average cost of a house i thought id be paying to
spacex,not_removed,fellow animatorvfx artistfilmmaker here kudos to all that illustration work and making a coherent vector design for everything to fit into some constructive criticism for the future i would try and reduce voice downtime as much as possible when the titles come up it goes from engaging animation to power point presentation instantly search out some more exciting music sound effects are good ways to mix things up and add life to the animation as well as with the title frames killing visual momentum theres a lot you can do to a static frame to make it come alive example of all these things obviously this is top tier animation performed by a team of people but look how alive everything becomes just by animating the dotted lines shifting the colors of gradient backgrounds twinking stars the shine wipe that makes objects look like a pane of glass slowly rotating planets etc all of which are virtually no skin off your back other slightly more complex things such as having new environments assemble themselves wipe in the sky fling in the ground pop in the foreground object are great improvements over simple fades or cuts between scenes
spacex,not_removed,it is not sufficient to make methane they also have to make oxygen water is not the waste product it is a necessary input that gets consumed thats where the hydrogen and part of the oxygen come from
spacex,not_removed,i cant be the only one who hates those nerdy act of intelligence youtube voices these days
spacex,not_removed,thanks dude the its variants were actually my favorite part of the whole thing to draw 😊 glad you liked em
spacex,not_removed,i havent watched the video yet but as i recall thats correct because it needs it to keep from flipping around during he pad abort it carried that then released it at the apex are we talking about the same thing edit i misread your comment i thought you were saying the error was that it took the finned trunk with it during an abort youre right the video shows the dragon leaving the trunk behind and that doesnt match what we saw in the pad abort
spacex,not_removed,how did i forget to fix that after it was pointed out the last time edit meant this in response to the dragon on the exploding falcon but this is true too
spacex,not_removed,yes this was a bit inaccurate hope it will never happen
spacex,not_removed,its a nice thought but it couldnt happen under current regulation no way the us would allow this to be licensed to any other country
spacex,not_removed,thanks for the feedback ill try to get back to some slightly slower pacing next time and see what i can do about a more consistent colour theme 😊 audio has definitely been tricky to figure out
spacex,not_removed,if is ok with that im on it edit
spacex,not_removed,human flight got a boost from the wright brothers but due to technology and other limitations it was hundreds of iterations before modern airliners arrived on the scene the engineering and other technology advances we have now are making it possible to skip from the moon and iss stages and the hundred iterations and get to the airliner version much sooner the difficult part is believing its possible
spacex,not_removed,im a software engineer i actually think it would be hugely beneficial to have programmers on site specifically for robotics applications i say this specifically with agile methodology in mind fast iteration process write deploy observe in real production conditions i think that last part is really important like you can do something similar on earth if you have identical copies of the hardware youre working with but you just cant reproduce the conditions perfectly thats not a big deal if your robot is just puttering around slowly taking pictures and mineral samples but for something like a mining or construction droid those subtle differences in conditions will make a big difference in effectiveness and that will impact the logic these things need so there wont be programmers in the first batch im sure but in the first couple hundred colonists id bet on it sadly all my experience is in web technology really need to change that
spacex,not_removed,i tend to agree yes programmers will be desirable eventually but it is not an early skill on mars now back on earth developing the its and the habitat there will be extensive needs for programming the other unlikely job listed is solar panel cleaner if needed at doubtful this is likely to come under the heading of robotics
spacex,not_removed,would probably need a couple to solve easy problems which can be solved there without having to wait for the round trip also helping to diagnose problems with all the automated stuff probably helpful to have someone there who can try to tell you straight away why the robot has gone berserk
spacex,not_removed,i see that slide as referring to the long term city on mars not the early arrivals the goal is for mars to be selfsustaining and that means everything and programming will be pretty important in the long run we are at a point in history where programmers are needed everywhere for everything and some programmers are going to want to go from that perspective if they go there will definitely be stuff to do but also surely people living in the city on mars will not want to have to beg a program manager on earth to commit some resources to work on their project they are going to want local control over the resources that contribute to their success and survival they are going to be developing new solutions to new problems and the people who are right there living it out are the ones who will be most motivated to get it done and get it done right
spacex,not_removed,but its still not statistically relevant yet there are just too few launches yet you could say that the failure rate is in the same order of magnitude as others but not much more
spacex,not_removed,technically its only the splitting of water to get hydrogen that consumes energy the sabatier reaction itself is exothermic so the video isnt wrong its just a little misleading
spacex,not_removed,if youre going to spend the rest of your life on mars you want to spend as little time in space as possible so that youre not a cancerridden radiation husk by your
spacex,not_removed,its hard to say since their finances are secret but assuming a profit margin of it would take about launches a year to make with reuse the profit margin should skyrocket as it were fh will be more profitable however i dont think musk has any intention of plowing all the profit from spacex into its im pretty sure he intends to find investors for the project also when its is developed it may be a huge money maker since it will truly have unique capabilities
spacex,not_removed,im guessing youll need the rest of that to pay for stuff to live on mars ticket to mars likely will be only a ticket to mars
spacex,not_removed,your comment reminded me of some of the bullies when i was in school who targeted kids they thought sounded smart not sure what you mean but i hope youre not one of the folks contributing to the idea that smart uncool
spacex,not_removed,well i kind of dislike the speed that they make subject transitions with those cuts and pastes very close to each other but not every one enjoys a minute documentary this wayfast spaming ideas they can get the idea to more ppl and im ok with that
spacex,not_removed,it may change one day boeing produce aircrafts and you can buy it so i guess in the future you could buy your own its if you are rich enough if its reusable and if spacex will produce a lot of it us government may think that hey everybody have big rockets with nuke anyway so its okay to sell i know that its military grade technology but there was a time when aircrafts were such technology yeah they still are its is like you can buy and you cannot buy i think it will work simmilar for rockets
spacex,not_removed,it wouldnt have to be a licenced copy once the idea is out there it can be independently replicated working from scratch i wouldnt expect a ship built that way to look so similar and progress would be very slow but it could be done spacex has already shown the world that first stage reuse can be done and suddenly competitors are showing off their halfarsed attempts at reuse adeline vulcan the same will probably happen with mars
spacex,not_removed,looks like it was done by uthefrek
spacex,not_removed,the solar panel cleaner was a bit of a joke was the most menial martian job i can think of 😛
spacex,not_removed,thats true ill put a little annotation to clear it up 😊
spacex,not_removed,also when its is developed it may be a huge money maker since it will truly have unique capabilities which besides going to mars the booster would have very nice lift capability true but honestly is there currently or in near future a market for it
spacex,not_removed,i figured he would seek investors but its good to know there could be a backup plan for relying on revenue only if they can drum up the business if all else fails but i do expect the broadband sat constellation if they work out the kinks to earn more than enough what triggered my question was seeing one too many sneering old guys sneer about spacex needing to do it and thus predicting it would never happen or having to go hand out to tax payers like was all that much in aerospace or like spacex didnt already have in launch contracts
spacex,not_removed,i belive he is talking about the voice dialog and not the idea it has nothing to do with bullies on the other end downvoting him like hell just because he disliked the voice dialog shows ppl here cant take a critique there are a number of videos on the internet where ppl over express ideas with lots of entusiam and they cut and remake the less entusiastic parts in the end you get the entire video with a burst of entusiastic dialogs it does not look natural it looks like ppl just took extasy pills before making the video while i also dont like it i get that it is a way to atract less traditional viewers
spacex,not_removed,except there is an inversion of technology so it is a false comparison military aircraft are substantially higher performance than civilian aircraft and civilian aircraft are unsuitable for most active combat roles in contrast military rockets are far simpler than crewed rockets as all they need to do is carry a relatively small payload not even to orbit while civilian rockets also need to carry passengers over a far longer distance so while a could not replace a an its could certainly carry not one nuke but and given that youre selling physical access to the technology it would be very difficult to avoid technology and knowledge transfer that could be applied to smaller more purpose built and effective military rockets
spacex,not_removed,and if as the video argues spacex were to fail as a company thousands of engineers would be dispersed with its knowhow going to seed as it were
spacex,not_removed,mp sent thank you
spacex,not_removed,how about a replacement for iss this rocket could lift it in one launch then there is other colonies such as on the moon solar power satellites if they are feasible tourism earth to earth passenger flights large scientific satellites such as space telescopes military applications whats the market for a truck
spacex,not_removed,yes is not all that much because spacex is a private company they probably can authorize it themselves the problem is that predictions in aerospace tend to be optimistic what happens if it actually ends up costing spacex probably couldnt handle that alone the good thing is that forprofit companies dont have an incentive to overrun their estimates so it probably wont be as bad as if nasa was running it
spacex,not_removed,if you read his deleted response to my message you might reevaluate your assumption of good faith
spacex,not_removed,yikes good luck in life
spacex,not_removed,whats the most expensive issue life support and testing it if they perfected the carbon fibre and are well on their way with the raptor and only spent tens of millions so far im having a hard time imagining where the rest of the cost is going to be
spacex,not_removed,pm me the reply
spacex,not_removed,you know you can just click on my account its still visible there i was referring to myself when i said i sounded like a faggot but its irrelevant i had nothing important to say and i knew there could be a misunderstanding i guess neither of you knew to just click on my account because youre not used to having your posts deleted i thought chairboy was also referring to voice dialogue and not ideas but yeah chairboy probably misunderstood me maybe you did as well i wasnt clear i was talking about just the way they sound and the words they use but more the words they use more complex than they should be look at all the informational youtube sciency videos from vsauce etc they all have the same sounding voice because people associate that voice with intelligence when i believe its more likely people use that voice in order to appear smart but look at it this way if they talked like a normal person their youtube channels wouldve probably never acheived any mass viewings i was probably picked on more strongly than chairboy was but maybe not but if someones not smart enough to get what i meant theyre probably not smart enough to learn it so why did i post anything at all i was just looking to vent
spacex,not_removed,yea i know what you mean they assume the viewer is a complete ignorant and explain even the most basic stuff like they own all knowledge but again some of the viewers are actualy complete ignorants and this way everyone can understand
spacex,not_removed,spaceflight insider received a report that spacex was considering to conduct a launch from on dec – it was not known which mission is supposed to take flight during this attempt spaceflight insider reached out to spacex seeking confirmation of this we are continuing to make progress with our anomaly investigation and working to return to flight safely and reliably we anticipate launching as early as november but have not announced any specific dates at this time a spacex spokesperson told spaceflight insider so no updates
spacex,not_removed,maybe the launch will slip to december and well have two rtfs on the same date
spacex,not_removed,is there anything preventing spacex from launching from both and vandenberg within a short time frame ie they get the nod to go and they launch within a few days of each other is there shared personnel between the locations or are the fully selfsufficient with the exception of mission control at hq

spacex,not_removed,for people trying to reconcile this against the rtf date heres one possibility the article describes a possible launch from in the middle of december but it doesnt actually say that the launch would be an rtf if they did a return to flight from vandenberg then inaugural launch might be the one in the middle of december
spacex,not_removed,is this because they think theyve identified and solved the september explosion issue
spacex,not_removed,other way at looking at this is how is the progress going to get ready for flight the rtf is also dependent on that too would be great if we got an update on the pads progress
spacex,not_removed,sorry if im not up to date but what is the status on have they started to repair it yet
spacex,not_removed,but elon said november
spacex,not_removed,theyve said all along that they were planning to have ready in middecember i dont know if this announcement indicates when they will launch from there s much as when they can launch from there
spacex,not_removed,the sidebar has rtf no earlier than middecember is this just an estimate or knownbutnotyetofficial
spacex,not_removed,so no updates i dont know why they say was instead of are maybe they know more than a certain subscriber only forum or its a typo
spacex,not_removed,is that even possible in terms of range control from cape canaveral more to the point has there been in recent aka within the past years multiple launches on the same day from that range it is something i hope is at least a possibility so far as the its is concerned that perhaps multiple launch sites could be used simultaneously there were some gemini flights that launched on the same day including two simultaneous crewed missions in one instance
spacex,not_removed,i think theres a launch crew at both sites so yes
spacex,not_removed,i believe they fly a number of ground crew between locations i was talking with an employee who works at vandy and he said he flies out to the cape at times and i understand that a number of cape ground crew fly out to vandy for launches there
spacex,not_removed,no there is no official word that theyve solved anything they are hoping the issue isnt related to the rocket itself but with the way they filled the second stage if that turns out to be the case they could return to flight this year in theory anyway
spacex,not_removed,its the booster
spacex,not_removed,well look what elon got for his birthday last year
spacex,not_removed,i know how you feel mine is the although i am in australia so assuming that you are in the us then we overlap a successful rtf of my favourite space company would be an excellent gift
spacex,not_removed,we are literally running out of room and need to get our sc into orbit who is we and does sc mean satellite constellation
spacex,not_removed,get ready for flight the rtf is also dependent on that too vafb is still good to go although iridium may not wanna play ball on being the rtf flight
spacex,not_removed,yeah of all the things elon says dates are especially not to be taken too seriously they tend to slip
spacex,not_removed,it was delayed so its now december
spacex,not_removed,its a bit of an awkward situation middecember came from elons nro speech which the subreddit had to remove but the information is out there as seen in this article so its not like were going to post outdated information in the sidebar when we know better
spacex,not_removed,i dont know why they say was instead of are the title of the article is currently spacex to launch from before years end the was is from the subject line entered by the person who posted the link
spacex,not_removed,he means orbcomm last year and then the flight this year are both rtf on the
spacex,not_removed,the cape range takes two or three days to reconfigure between launcher types it could be quicker for two identical launches but even the gemini double flight had a considerable and dec delay between launches
spacex,not_removed,they meant the december rtf
spacex,not_removed,if the shared crew perform the same job at both locations and they need to be there for the entire duration of these jobs as opposed to showing up for the last two days of a sixday job for example then this determines what relative timings of the two launches are possible for example if an employee needs to be at both sites for a task that starts at days and completes at days then the launches have to be at least three days apart or maybe four days to allow for travel time for the example given the employee works at site a sundaytuesday for a saturday launch then on wednesday travels to site b and works thursdaysaturday for a launch on wednesday of the next week and if that task for the earlier launch turns out to take a day longer than planned then the later launch schedule slips at least a day if the presence of a particular employee is not essential lets send a bunch of guys to prepare the flame trench then the timing constraints are less critical
spacex,not_removed,no there is no official word that theyve solved anything no official word but theres some pretty strong rumors that they are finalizing the report now and that this rtf date is based on that
spacex,not_removed,would they return to flight before solving the issue
spacex,not_removed,the article itself shows the image but for whatever reason the thumbnail shows an image from the mission
spacex,not_removed,oh no just looked it up i was expecting something nice it wasnt
spacex,not_removed,probably iridium they are in a world of hurt and need their birds to fly asap
spacex,not_removed,if it is delayed again it will be january thats how delays work
spacex,not_removed,i think this might be based on newer information
spacex,not_removed,gotta wonder why spacex pr is saying november if even elon is saying itll be later doesnt honestly seem like good pr to me unless november really is still possible
spacex,not_removed,doesnt really make sense to post a net date substantially later than the net date actually publicized if were going to do that we might as well just label them speculative dates
spacex,not_removed,which the subreddit had to remove can you elaborate on the specifics of this
spacex,not_removed,the was is from the subject line entered by the person who posted the link but its also in the article itself spaceflight insider received a report that spacex was considering to conduct a launch from on dec – english is not my first language so i might be reading it wrong
spacex,not_removed,right from the article emphasis mine spaceflight insider received a report that spacex was considering to conduct a launch from on dec – it was not known which mission is supposed to take flight during this attempt
spacex,not_removed,iirc both use eastern range assets which may not be able to reconfigure quickly enough to handle two flights
spacex,not_removed,but gemini was planned to launch from the same day that they launched the target vehicle from the target vehicle didnt make it all the way to orbit so they scrubbed but at least in they were able to launch two vehicles on the same day
spacex,not_removed,what does it mean to reconfigure the range
spacex,not_removed,the best solution would be if they are able to find a fueling sequence that replicates the events observed in the anomaly including the explosive failure of the copv and then find a fueling sequence that avoids the explosion and any of the suspected symptoms leading up to it for multiple copv tanks and for multiple runs of the sequence for each tank but its possible that the explosive failure was a one in a thousand or one in ten thousand event even with the fueling sequence that was used on september if that turns out to be the case then they may have to be satisfied with a solution that involves less than complete replication of the failure for example they could use the september fueling sequence on a batch of copvs monitor them during the sequence maybe repeat multiple times then analyze the copvs and maybe find degradation that could have led to breach if it had gone further or find that measured stresses on the copvs exceeded safety ratings and could have led to failure then they could try other fueling sequences multiple times on multiple copvs and find one that never leads to symptoms consistent with the anomaly or any other possible failure modes
spacex,not_removed,report will be done and shared with nasausaf long time before going public feedback also so its indeed possible
spacex,not_removed,absolutely not and thats a big reason we dont have a concrete returntoflight timeframe in spaceflight its a huge nono to return to flight without giving the accident investigation absolutely everything youve got if the same accident were to occur again thats hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain because of a lack of rigor perhaps though after a few months if spacex is still not certain of the cause they could just remedy the two or three most likely failure scenarios
spacex,not_removed,not under normal circumstances like were in now during a time of war or an emergency maybe but not this flight spacex has had major failures in flights they need to prove to everyone that they can reliably fly then they need to prove to everyone that they can reliably refly used boosters
spacex,not_removed,yes if they think there is nothing they can do to make progress on it they will just go ahead and fly again this is not unusual in engineering sometimes you just dont have enough information to solve a problem
spacex,not_removed,its possible that they edited the post after the reddit post was made and the thumbnail cached the old version
spacex,not_removed,excuses excuses id like for elon to be accurate on a date at least once
spacex,not_removed,might be newer information without a new date its still over months out that we are talking about so plenty could change id be more interested in hearing about when they plan to sign out the investigation
spacex,not_removed,doesnt really even seem to be a might the article is quite clear that its a new report but its not official
spacex,not_removed,bad pr would be publicly updating every net date every time they slip a month theyre just maintaining the party line since gwynnes first november mention in midseptember presumably theyll update it once december is actually firm
spacex,not_removed,elon might not be as informed on rtf as gwynne shotwell i counsel patience as yoda once sort of said there is no try there is only do or not do the rocket will fly when it is ready
spacex,not_removed,not really unfortunately the mods basically just that they
spacex,not_removed,elon gave a talk at the nro someone cant recall if they were associated with nro or spacex gave a text summary of the talk nothing too earthshattering sabotage was listed as unlikely but still being investigated if i recall the info about solid forming inside the copv tank overwrap and as the helium pressure crushing it into the cf and spontaneously detonating as the most probably cause for the incident came from this post as well a few other tidbits that i cant recall now the poster said that they had cleared the post with security but evidently that wasnt good enough shortly thereafter the entire thread got deleted at op andor nro andor spacexs request the mods apologized and said that they couldnt say more about it i havent looked but im sure theres reddit mirror sites that still have the discussion up if its a burning desire for you tbh it was interesting but nothing that was particularly mindblowing hope the poster didnt get in too much trouble over it
spacex,not_removed,id think that that is largely because of the semantics of reported speech namely that it should be in past tense which makes was the correct word to use
spacex,not_removed,ok note that the use of was there is different to what we would assume when we read it in a title was in a title pretty much states that it no longer is was in that quote simply recognises that the report came from the past was goes with received as both pasttense words but anyway post titles cant be changed so there is no point discussing it
spacex,not_removed,again he means the rtf last year and then the rtf this year two separate years but both on the of december
spacex,not_removed,id forgotten the original gemini mission was due to launch an orbit after its target i suspect the fact the two were heading for the same orbit helped and by the tone of the accident report there was probably much less equipment needed resetting in the
spacex,not_removed,i imagine theres lots of settings for avionicstrackingradaretc that are specifically tuned for each vehicle
spacex,not_removed,pointing radars and cameras in the right direction moving the mobile units to the appropriate place for particular pad being used swapping telemetry decoders checking communications to the vehicle and so on
spacex,not_removed,in what fields of engineering is that common and can you please tell me so i can make sure to not drive on those bridgesfly in those planes
spacex,not_removed,elon as a rule is not accurate on dates he has said his dates are what is possible if his staff worked like him which they dont hence his dates are most always wrong its not excuses his estimations just dont line up with reality double whatever he says and you get a bit closer to the true date
spacex,not_removed,that is very true and as always considerations or net dates are subject to change regarding the investigation if they truly plan to rtf in december i think we will know a lot more about its outcome well before that fingers crossed at least
spacex,not_removed,i don´t think there´s a single important thing about spacex on wich elon may be uninformed
spacex,not_removed,thats a huge stretch i cant imagine how either the ceocto or president of a company would have less information than the other for any significant period of time – especially for something that important
spacex,not_removed,elon probably made it a condition of doing the ama
spacex,not_removed,thats how i read it the was in the title of the post implying no longer is and when i read the article my brain autocorrected the line quoted to report that came from the past and didnt make the connection thanks to ulockstocknl and uoldsellsword for pointing it out
spacex,not_removed,that would definitely make sense also gemini was launched using a modified titan ii which likely required far less analytics and tracking than modern launchers considering they were designed to be launched en masse during or after a nuclear strike
spacex,not_removed,and hardware itself is pretty obsolete sadly so ill not be surprised if many of their systems may require reconfiguration literally by hand
spacex,not_removed,well it certainly happens in software other types of engineering are simpler so maybe it doesnt happen in those as much but i know that several airplane crashes were never solved now that we have black boxes it is less common
spacex,not_removed,possible if his staff worked like him kind of a shot to your workforce isnt it his workforce trying to work like him is probably why theyve had a couple of failures in the last few years very easy to miss the little details when you are running on fumes if someone from quality makes a mistake that could be the end of your rocket elon is not the one doing the critical inspections and engineering analysis so its not really fair to compare how hard he works vs everyone else in his company
spacex,not_removed,moreover elon errs on the side of optimism always even when hes in the loop if hes out of it hes surely going to say something impossibly soon
spacex,not_removed,no and there was something else that came out in the comments of that thread i think its reasonable to assume that was what caused the mods to delete any mention of it
spacex,not_removed,the quote is not exact i dont remember what he said exactly but that was the general gist of it
spacex,not_removed,now you have my curiosity
spacex,not_removed,aye gotcha i guess for now ill stick with the rule of pi then for most spacex dates multiply the estimated date by
spacex,not_removed,personally i think multiplying by pi and then by e is more accurate it is certainly more scientific entrepreneurs like musk are always wildly optimistic if they werent they would never try the impossible trying to do the impossible is what drives progress
spacex,not_removed,so will be the first this is great hopefully everything will go well
spacex,not_removed,there also was no material change in the insurance rate compared to using a new falcon rocket indicating insurers confidence in the launch vehicle halliwell said this is huge news paves the way for future customers
spacex,not_removed,id be interested to know how much the refurbishment for the first stage cost this time i imagine its a lot as they probably inspected everything as its the first stage to be reused but it would be interesting to know if the use of this rocket will provide cost savings for spacex already
spacex,not_removed,very very exciting this will probably be the first launch ill try to watch live i havent been as engaged lately but the first reuse of will be fantastic especially if they land it again cant wait i hope it happens in october
spacex,not_removed,cant wait till first reused get off the ground
spacex,not_removed,im so excited see this and i can only hope everything goes perfectly looks like im going to have to fly down to photograph a launch for the second time this year
spacex,not_removed,im quite surprised i thought shotwell was pretty insistent the first reflown booster be an rtls perhaps i remembered wrong that or the customer didnt materialize

spacex,not_removed,does anybody know what an agreement like this might look like from a liability standpoint does spacex or its underwriters insurers cover costs of lost payloads does the customer accept some risk liability
spacex,not_removed,is it true that spacex is sending all the engines from each flight to texas for testing edit i know theyve already sent one booster to texas for fullduration burns but i hope they dont have to send all engines from every flight
spacex,not_removed,i wonder is launching a satellite from a reused falcon cheaper for companies
spacex,not_removed,see also about the same subject edit thanks for a random downvote
spacex,not_removed,using my phone i got some quite suspicious popups not sure whether this page despite its content is a good source
spacex,not_removed,the article seems to be hinting that the lunch will be an expendable one
spacex,not_removed,another way to look at it would be insurers see risks in a reused rocket flight as no greater than the first time it flew
spacex,not_removed,i seem to remember this being said some time ago soon after one of the earlier landings and talk shifted to reuse that was back then so i can only imagine confidence has improved further with each success
spacex,not_removed,the article says they did individual engine tests in texas and now are putting them back in the booster it makes sense for first time studies but long term that would be expensive for every flight and doesnt seem be the plan i think the exciting part of this mission is that this is the first booster likely to be recovered twice it makes the point of just how far ahead of the competition spacex is
spacex,not_removed,right now its probably quite expensive to refurbish the rocket however as more of them will be fixed up it will become clear which parts need to be replaced or redesigned in order to make sure that they are reusable this refurbishing process should become cheaper as time goes on not only will less parts need replacing the time and effort it takes to refurbish the rocket will also decrease the process of checking the parts for any significant damage might even become automated pretty cool
spacex,not_removed,current date is no earlier than october so extremely small chance it actually happens in october
spacex,not_removed,its going to be more nerve racking than the rtf though
spacex,not_removed,hopefully well get to see the first reused land as well
spacex,not_removed,whered you shoot from the first time
spacex,not_removed,that mightve kept them waiting nasa probably wouldnt want to be first with a crs mission and most other customers are gto
spacex,not_removed,its going to be launched from cape canaveral you can see the launch from anywhere at the kennedy space center but the best viewing for the public is gantry ive watched from there and it was spectacular and ill be down there for this flight as well
spacex,not_removed,i imagine its very similar to a launch agreement using a new booster
spacex,not_removed,the article seems to be hinting that the lunch will be an expendable one i find that highly unlikely if they manage to land this core then it will allow them to see what two trips to space do to a booster that information is very valuable at this stage
spacex,not_removed,i disagree the article simply doensnt mention a landing attempt big difference heres why they will perform an attempt theyre spacex they push boundaries musk frequently stated the boosters have the potential of nearly flights in them why not worst case rud not like we havent seen that before returning a booster twice will give the public way more faith in the plan to move to full and rapid reusability not trying a landing attempt would imply spacex has no faith in said plan edit formatting
spacex,not_removed,my hope is that insurers will rate future launches on flown hardware at a lower cost at some point as the flight vehicle is then proven
spacex,not_removed,i consider no material change to be sort of weasel words so there might actually have been a greater cost but it wasnt significantly greater or it could have been slightly cheaper the words arent clear enough for us to know
spacex,not_removed,but long term that would be expensive for every flight and doesnt seem be the plan yet even that would be an improvement over the current status quo and the shuttle winwin either way
spacex,not_removed,i think it was said by musk that the plan for the future will be to do a static fire at the cape to verify all engines at once and to then assign the rocket a new payload and a new second stage presumably there would be a second static fire just a few days before launch as there is now
spacex,not_removed,my bad i havent been following this sub as closely as i used to thanks for the correction
spacex,not_removed,im actually pretty surprisedstoked its happening so soon after the first successful landing was expecting to have to wait more than a year for them to do their rigorous test and analyses to make sure all is good
spacex,not_removed,which gives me a thought if there was a loss of vehicle on a reused core flight like this would there be a hold on all missions or only a hold on reused core flights
spacex,not_removed,if they manage to achieve both goals in the same flight that will be a big leap
spacex,not_removed,ganty and the view was amazing
spacex,not_removed,plus just think of the tweets launch a payload to orbit land repeat
spacex,not_removed,requiring them to not save any fuel for an attempted landing would go against spacex offering a discount and it would really have to come from the client ses is actively and vocally pushing for achieving reuse of rockets they are the last customer that would require spacex to abandon attempts at reuse i cant think of a better story than if spacex is successful launching on rocket and then manages to recover the rocket again
spacex,not_removed,well after many flights it will ultimately depend on whether or not the failure rate of flight proven hardware is lower than that of new hardware so more pressure on the engineers than the insurance companies to make that change
spacex,not_removed,that will depend on if rockets follow a bathtub curve most failure models or perhaps better phrased failure rates for items decreases to a minimum after x number of uses and stay there for most of its life before increasing at the end of its life cycle the bathtub curve essentially says that at the beginning of the life manufacturing defects cause failure and once those settle out failure is low until end of life when repetitive stress induced mechanical failure but to me since rockets are inherently nearly perfect and rid of manufacturing flaws when first flown it is unlikely for failure rates to decrease much
spacex,not_removed,well we know the stage is already at the launch site
spacex,not_removed,no problem all the current information is in the sidebar so you can follow it more easily
spacex,not_removed,probably a hold on all until spacex eliminated design flaw from investigations and could at least show that it was an incorrectly refurbished or worn part
spacex,not_removed,probably all cause of loss could affect new vehicles as well
spacex,not_removed,nice shots i hate how that tower almost blocks the rocket though
spacex,not_removed,i cant think of a better story than if spacex is successful launching on rocket and then manages to recover the rocket again does that and then launches that same rocket again in under a month
spacex,not_removed,it still shows as net nov in the sidebar
spacex,not_removed,is there some way to acess the sidebar in the app
spacex,not_removed,yeah i kind of do too i didnt notice it until i got back but ill take what i can get
spacex,not_removed,each app will be different theres also a httpswwwredditcomrspacexwikilaunchesmanifest in the wiki
spacex,not_removed,you need to work on getting that fax machine certified p
spacex,not_removed,well officially the fh demo flight is scheduled in dec
spacex,not_removed,why is fh listed for when we know it is officially still how about adding an inofficial date behind the official date like this nov spx
spacex,not_removed,yeah i have a spacenews app that has the launch manifest just a bit annoying because it sounds like the sidebar does more than just launches everytime i go to pull up the full websote on my mobile browser it crashes time for an upgrade to both app and phone p
spacex,not_removed,the screenshot is pretty hard to read plus only a part of the text is visible so heres an attempt at a transcript the missing bits were filled in by me based on guesses marked with bold letters a series of tankers to are used in preparation for earth departure requires inspace cryogenic propellant storage and transfer also considering transfer of cargo on orbit at least in the longer term mars ship waits for departure window performs transmars injection from leo mars ship contains sufficient propellant to subsequently land on mars delivering at least mt of usable cargopeople ship then refills on mars using locallysourced propellant and returns to earth with smaller payload some ships may stay initially although important to provide return capability this appears to be an interim version of the mct architecture dated around new pieces of information not mentioned elsewhere i think tanker shipments to refill the spaceship this suggests that tankership sizing was not pinned down precisely up until the final months from the its presentation we know it that the tanker can ship up tons of fuel which refills the spaceship from almost zero to fuel in trips payload back to earth is smaller than payload to mars this is because the return trip is some initial ships may stay on the surface of mars makes sense if propellant manufacturing is too slow or if storage capacity for propellant is too low the date at the bottom left corner is this suggests that the increase from tons of payload capacity to the surface of mars was raised from to tons sometime during the last year as well the text in the bottom right corner is spacex proprietary i think edit more information
spacex,not_removed,although its nothing new its still cool to see the behind the scenes
spacex,not_removed,maybe the first ship doesnt deliver the isru fuel plant maybe it is the isru if you think about it a plant large enough is going to be bulky do you want to store all of the components and force someone to put it together in a mustcomplete operation to return from the planet instead the ship could have it preassembled functional and tested when it leaves and could use its own tanks as storage tanks
spacex,not_removed,some ships may stay initially is totally different than some initial ships will stay because that makes it sound like they wont ever be able to return because theyre early versions
spacex,not_removed,soz likely duped in the other thread on this hadnt loaded for me screenshot here if needed feel free to remove mods
spacex,not_removed,cargo transfer was briefly mentioned on one of the iac slides it makes sense bfrits can lift tons to leo but a fully fueled its can fly tons from leo to mars surface if you want to fly the maximum payload mass you need another launch to bring the rest of the payload to the ship

spacex,not_removed,video deleted
spacex,not_removed,where is the video
spacex,not_removed,i was able to watch on my appletv with the natgeo app there was a great video after the episode that was a bit of a back story for one of the astronauts in the episode it was fantastic
spacex,not_removed,i watched this tonight and i must say damn theres some spacex money shots plus the heartbreaking mission control reaction almost made me tear up while the dramatization side has some weird vehicle control things similar to the martian i was iffy about i still cant wait for episode
spacex,not_removed,id think youd want to leave a few there initially just as emergency habitation life support etc just in case of a problem with the initial structures that were built initially maybe you have dome that dome springs a leak or some major life support component fails you have a problem there is also the issue of wearandtear sitting on the surface getting blasted by the occasional dust storm and large temperature swings unclear how much sit time the lander would have before it needed serious inspection refurbishment before launching again i assume the initial landings arent going to be ready to refuel and head straight back
spacex,not_removed,that it says mt of usable cargopeople suggests this is such old information that we shouldnt give too much weight to any of it in his talk the figure was
spacex,not_removed,i was actually thinking of posting a question about them keeping some of them there if you ship all them back then your refinery isnt doing anything during the time it takes for you to get the next one it might be possible but the process would have to be scaled up to deal with the smaller window pluss first ships might need to be cannibalized and the early ships will probably be phased out after design improvements are made
spacex,not_removed,some initial ships may stay on the surface of mars i mean this makes sense regardless as those ships wont have the luxury of any preexisting hardware on mars whatsoever they may have to stay until the propellant manufacturing capability of the mars base catches up with and surpasses the demand from the ships coming from earth at which time they can be refueled with the extra propellant being manufactured and rejoin the rest of the fleet in shuttling cargo and people to mars
spacex,not_removed,payload back to earth is smaller than payload to mars this is because the return trip is more likely because the mars vehicle has to get to martian orbit without a first stage and they cant refill the vehicle in mars orbit
spacex,not_removed,instead of eg used please use u in line with common editorial practice of supplemented text
spacex,not_removed,that last point is kinda important really excited to see what spacex can do in the next years
spacex,not_removed,mars ship waits for departure window performs transmars injection from leo how sure are we that transmars injection will actually be from leo obviously that is logistically simplest but you could significantly increase the payload capacity by performing transmars injection from a higher or more eccentric orbit like gto i could also see this varying a lot from mission to mission depending on how much mass they are trying to land
spacex,not_removed,some initial ships may stay on the surface of mars also provides a ship to cannibalize parts from
spacex,not_removed,bottom right corner text could also be spacex preparations or spacex progression
spacex,not_removed,the text in the bottom right corner is spacex proprietary i think oops spacex natgeo
spacex,not_removed,it was genuinely cool to get a small peak into the types of meetings that birthed the its also incredibly depressing watching those reactions to
spacex,not_removed,according to elons ama the first two missions will deliver parts for the isru plant which will need to be assembled by the first colonists
spacex,not_removed,i think someone messed up with an early tweet i guess asking for mirrors here would just get your comment deleted so i guess im waiting until mid november edit heres a usonly direct link from natgeos site httpchannelnationalgeographiccommarsvideosnovomundo
spacex,not_removed,also available on amazon for free at least in the us
spacex,not_removed,on twitter apparently the service for text messages and minute videos
spacex,not_removed,episode is available for free on itunes amazon
spacex,not_removed,and being discussed
spacex,not_removed,for leo for mars
spacex,not_removed,the alternative is robotic deployment of isru and power infrastructure the easiest route is just to leave the first ship or two there but thats a big sunk cost someone has to pay for either a customer like nasa or spacex
spacex,not_removed,how dangerous is the dust on mars to a space ship i remember reading something about the dust on the moon being really abrasive and causing problems would a ship on mars for or ten years still be able to function properly after being exposed to the elements for so long
spacex,not_removed,worst comes to worst the colonists will be able to tear it down for parts or scrap if they have to if they have basic metalworking capabilities it could become necessary to use the ship to effect repairs on colony things
spacex,not_removed,called all of this in the thread after musks speech also the initial man crew need someplace to live
spacex,not_removed,on the other hand mars gravity and the mars gravity well are very different from earth which would tend to increase the return payload so thats at least three factors affecting the difference in payload between earth to mars and mars to earth it also suits elons interests because he is more interested in sending things to mars than in bringing them back though he also said its very important that people have the option to return to earth though he expects that over the long run most people will not use that option
spacex,not_removed,is there any obstacle to refueling in mars orbit with a tanker sent there or is cost the only limitation to that
spacex,not_removed,they cant refill the vehicle in mars orbit i dont think thats true sending a itstanker to mars would be an excellent way to further increase payload masses and mission robustness this was its tanker for mars duty question the its tanker is amazingly low cost with a would it make sense to dedicate one or two tankers to the surface of mars where they could refill its spaceships in low mars orbit this would give returning its spaceships an additional δv of kms and it would also give arriving its spaceships an additional δv of kms and would thus allow an increase in cargo downmass of future optimization
spacex,not_removed,how sure are we that transmars injection will actually be from leo obviously that is logistically simplest but you could significantly increase the payload capacity by performing transmars injection from a higher or more eccentric orbit like gto i could also see this varying a lot from mission to mission depending on how much mass they are trying to land the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiobertheffect is very significant in low earth orbit as it reduces the δv by about so i believe all major burns that can be done in leo will be done in leo
spacex,not_removed,bottom right corner would be spacex proprietary
spacex,not_removed,probably not proprietary any more
spacex,not_removed,yh i commented on another post how heartbreaking it was to watch was graphic enough to watch at the time seeing the employees reactions just made the emotions even more real you can see how much it meant to them i thought i felt bad
spacex,not_removed,if somebody wonders link to the full episode
spacex,not_removed,would they not want to make sure the ships can return fuelling kinda needed before they send anyone
spacex,not_removed,this seems like a risky gamble to me yes the colonists will accept the fact that they probably will never return but isru is a huge part of the mission architecture regardless so it is incredibly bold to only start testing it on mars after you start sending people
spacex,not_removed,might as well try mirrors

spacex,not_removed,wait wasnt it going to be premiered in the middle of november
spacex,not_removed,sorry that page doesnt exist
spacex,not_removed,says tons to mars and that agrees with
spacex,not_removed,its only a sunk cost for a synode or two after which those loitering ships can be refueled and flown again also each spaceship has a targeted unit cost of million dollars which while certainly not cheap in absolute terms is extremely cheap for a vehicle of such scale and would by no means break the bank for spacex elon musk could finance a one way flight to mars of the first spaceship by himself even compared to something like the curiosity rover which cost billion dollars the price to pay for putting one of these ships on mars permanently would be pocket change a bad strategy to continue doing if your goal is to make mars colonization happen but doing it a couple of times in the beginning to get the ball rolling is well within reasonable strategy robotic deployment of such a system seems to me to be highly unlikely due to the extreme difficulty and complexity for all the complexity that is involved in keeping humans alive humans are so versatile that it will probably end up just being easier to send the equipment and have people set it up rather than send a ship and the robots necessary and design the equipment to be able to be moved and handled by those robots and set up into a functioning system a huge thing to remember is that with a robotic system if something inside one of the machines is broken or even just stuck and your robot isnt specifically designed to work with that problem youre pretty much out of luck with a person you could conceivably fix almost any problem that didnt total the machine i work in a factory here on earth and trust me you would not believe how often some little belt or bearing works itself loose that takes ten minutes for a person to fix and yet i cant think of a way any of our current robotic technology could fix the problem two guys can climb on top of a locked out conveyor to pull and stretch and wrestle a belt back onto place i challenge anyone to build a robot that can do that job alone which doesnt cost over a million dollars per unit and require years to develop now imagine needing a different specially designed robot to fix every likely to occur problem in a propellant factory set up by other robots on another planet where theres an average of minutes speedoflight delay finally even if we had the robotic technology to set up a mars propellant and storage factory that wouldnt change the fact that its probably gonna take more than two years from landing to actually producing several thousand tons of propellant thats the real bottleneck unless you had a way of landing on mars and setting up your entire power plant and fuel factory and having it fully operational in a couple of weeks you wont be ready to send your whole landed fleet of ships back by the time you have to leave the first unmanned ships will carry everything needed to set up the propellant factory and maybe even unload their cargo autonomously the first manned ship will be the first ship to be able to launch from mars as the crews number one priority will be to set up the power plant and fuel factory and refill their ride home thisll probably take them all the way to the next launch window at which point theyd leave behind every other ship as well as the propellant factory the next mission however will already have their factory setup so they could focus more on working on the mars base itself while keeping the factory running and producing propellant for the ships already parked on mars which would probably number unmanned ship one empty cargo ship from the first manned mission two more cargo ships and the current missions manned spaceship theyd probably only be able to make enough fuel for or three of the ships but itd be an improvement eventually the mars base will need to be able to produce enough fuel over the time between launch windows to resupply dozens of landing ships to allow for samesynode return flights which means producing multiple tons of fuel per day constantly long before they reached that pace they would have the capacity to refill every landed ship on mars including the first ever ship but it may be that enough time had gone by that the first ship simply wouldnt run anymore
spacex,not_removed,i am asking myself the same however nasa plans call for predeployment of the mav one synod earlier they seem to think it is doable the martian dust is not nearly as abrasive as moon dust it has been blown around for a billion years or more it should be well rounded even in the thin martian atmosphere
spacex,not_removed,moon dust is very jagged mars is much more rounded dust from millennia of wind and water flows earlier on mars dust is not a big problem at all
spacex,not_removed,well heres an answer from someone without a science background opportunity has been running pretty good for years so the dust cant be that mechanically abrasive
spacex,not_removed,martian dust is probably much less abrasive than say the dust produced when mining stuff on earth in a mining operation rock gets freshly pulverized so it still has sharp edges on all the tiny grains on mars the only dust thats blowing around has more or less been blowing around fro billions of years smoothing down more and more as time goes by moon dust on the other hand is formed when meteor impacts create brief clouds of aluminum oxide vapor which condenses into crystals and rains down onto the surface it is exposed to minimal erosion and worse the grain structure is like sharp jagged lumps of glass shards its actually worse than that because aluminum oxide is a much harder material than glass and is also known as sapphire the level of abrasiveness of moon dust is truly incredible
spacex,not_removed,im sure that mars dust is potentially problematic for machinery but despite that the nasa rovers seem to be doing alright in it i imagine that with humans around who can wipe off important parts daily dependability would be further improved moon dust is jagged and sharp at the microscopic level because it was all formed by pulverizing processes with no erosion to smooth the edges martian dust isnt so shrapnellike which is better but much finer which is potentially worse it will probably find a way to get absolutely everywhere and afaik the real problem is that its also full of perchlorates which are apparently trivial to rinse out of soil but also toxic to humans and i dont know if any sort of mass perchlorate scrubdown technology has been proposed by anyone yet
spacex,not_removed,metalworking capabilities are pretty useless if your ship is made of carbon fiber yknow p
spacex,not_removed,early on it would be extra risk and more difficult to perform a rendezvous without extensive ground tracking equipment later on it should be easier though
spacex,not_removed,there is not enough delta v to send a taker there with fuel in it not enough fuel to slow down to reach mars orbit tanker vehicle is not designed to land on mars to refuel
spacex,not_removed,having a tanker is mars orbit would be great i just cant see how to get it there with fuel onboard the mars ship uses tankerloads of fuel to get to mars and a big helping from the atmosphere to slow down scheduling four bfr flights just to get more return mass doesnt make sense im not sure that fuel is the only constraint on downmass
spacex,not_removed,yes but the oberth effect is at least as strong at periapsis of an eccentric gtolike orbit
spacex,not_removed,ah ok
spacex,not_removed,especially as theywere so excited about that landing attempt amos must have been terrible aswell they were going so well

spacex,not_removed,i guess not but they plan to demo isru with red dragon and if things go badly worst case they can wait until more hardware arrives
spacex,not_removed,typical mars expedition plans would only have a short surface stay so they need the return vehicle to be fueled before they land the people this is fine for nasa but not for a business spacex will want to start earning revenue asap if the mission is bringing colonists or longterm residents why worry about the return trip the fuel plant can probably be more productive and cheaper if it isnt weighed down by a bunch of automation hardware besides automation adds failure modes making it more likely that something will not work and spacex will have to send somebody to mars to fix it anyway
spacex,not_removed,it is not terribly risky even if they are stuck for a while with recycling to take care of water and oxygen they just need food which is not particularly high mass pounds per person per year assuming half a dozen people on the first mission that is of extra food to be prepared for an extra synod in case it is necessary and as more food would be needed eventually anyway it would not even be a waste so while it would be annoying if the isru plant didnt work properly and they had to wait an extra synod if you trust your hab there shouldnt be any actual problems
spacex,not_removed,darn c was really hoping to watch it does anyone have any information or backups of the video edit httpchannelnationalgeographiccommarsvideosnovomundo
spacex,not_removed,sorry that page doesnt exist
spacex,not_removed,theyve pulled it on twitter now
spacex,not_removed,odd its working on chrome on a windows desktop anyway in the us maybe a geoblock
spacex,not_removed,it was deleted recently it wasnt deleted when i posted it
spacex,not_removed,i guess they did not think onorbit refueling would be used back then
spacex,not_removed,personally not a fan of the seeming lack of ability to deliver large cargo modules with the its process equipment is generally more efficient in a larger form and breaking everything down into smaller components in order to fit out a small hatch and be handled could be problematic keeping everything for a prop plant on board removes a huge amount of complexity of on surface construction ops plus the tanks are already there and im sure having a complete spare set of components of an its would be a welcome comfort for future missions it will be interesting to see how they propose to break up the process though will spacex try and draw all the required out of the atmosphere via a wavar seems challenging to meet the production requirements and is very location dependent or ice mining from soil if ice mining from soil they would obviously need a lot of mobile equipment do they crush regolith on the surface or haul it up to the its the more processing they can do on the surface with distributed mobile equipment the less vulnerable they are to single point failures but at the trade of reduced process efficiency by the smaller scale dust contamination will no doubt be a major consideration ideally they would only need to bring water up to the its for the sabatier reactors on board but if using an evaporative process to extract water this places the surface equipment in a poor thermal environment dealing with heat management of all the different processes will be a really big challenge what with needing to provide heat possibly to evaporate ice from crushed regolith condense cool electrolyze feed into sabatier reactor an exothermic process and then compress and chill gases to cryogenic liquids to store which would need constant cooling to keep in liquid state while some of the waste heat could be used to evaporate ice they would still need to dump the rest so the challenge is dropping a line for on surface coolant loopsradiators or maybe they do it all on board lots of considerations and some big challenges would be extremely exciting to be a part of
spacex,not_removed,just a quick response on mobile but i didnt mean to imply that i thought robotic deployment was more realistic there are just too many unknowns about what it will take to get the propellant plants up and running i have always thought with spacex plans that the first crew should be people that dont want to come back for this reason give them plenty of supplies to survive from earth while they build the base of operations remove reliable isru production from the critical path of survival and make it a cornerstone for future growth instead with large ships and tonnes of cargo you can give people a hell of a lot to work with
spacex,not_removed,the main bootstrapping problem to samewindow turnaround is getting enough tank volume propellant tanks are bulky anything that could fit inside a normal lander would be about diameter maybe each since methalox is roughly ton per m³ we need about m³ or tanks for each shipload you can only fit in each level so you need levels of cargo for one full propellant load there are only two cargo levels on each ship even a cargo variant wont bring this below about four trips for each shipload of propellant capacity that means delivering a oneway ship is a great way to get four or five trips worth of propellant storage in one trip if they were to deliver a tanker with its capacity that would be even better four tankers could store propellant for five ships in the long run a different storage method needs to be considered at first that might be expandable deployable tanks so the shipping is masslimited instead of volumelimited i havent seen anything like this for cryogenic propellants but its not explicitly forbidden by physics beyond a dozen or so ships though we need to think bigger large storage cisterns seem to be the best option this would be something excavated with a tbm or mining equipment perhaps during ice excavation reinforced insulated and lined with an impermeable membrane with no diameter constraints we would be free to dig two huge storage tanks or a series of smaller ones whatever fits the available equipment best pressure from the mass of rock and regolith above would help balance the internal pressure of the tanks so no extreme structural materials would be needed
spacex,not_removed,edit i mixed up spacecraft with the whole stack each spaceship has a targeted unit cost of million dollars do yall think this is super optimistic or insanely optimistic im leaning toward insanely but i might be too negative lets say that a raptor costs only as much as a merlin you still have as many engines the fairing ive heard costs a few million dollars the its is about the height of the fairing and the diameter so thats the surface area theyre surely banking on massive reductions in manufacturing cost which theyre already making big progress on with the but million still just seems like crazytalk to me ill be delighted if they prove me wrong
spacex,not_removed,a human is a robot too just a very good one ai will explode in the near future due to a positive feedback loop a human needs time to perform actions which cause reactions from which he can learn a machine can perform millions of actions and learn from millions of reactions per second just think about google you type something and it tries to predict what you want billions of people do that i can imagine it wont take long until this prediction will get very spooky almost mind reading like i am curious how google will fix that because it would be very unbeneficial if people would start to fear their search engine i bet breaking mechanisms are allready in place to not make google too good based on search input google could pretty much predict anything happening in the world sudden interest into a certain stock could indicate a rise in value and so on at this point im not sure if they just dont use it or if they only use it for themselves secretly
spacex,not_removed,certainly not abrasive enough to prohibit familiar machinery from being an option in most cases lower gravity probably lowers power requirements too
spacex,not_removed,well you could make screws and attach the panels to something right
spacex,not_removed,yeah i wonder though about having marsbased tanker later on for departing deepspace missions it seems that the lower gravity and distance from the sun would make mars a good place for refueling missions to the outer solar system
spacex,not_removed,having a tanker is mars orbit would be great i just cant see how to get it there with fuel onboard my suggestion is to base the itstanker on the surface of mars so that it can lift isru manufactured propellant to mars orbit this is possible very cheaply as low mars orbit can be reached from the surface of mars with a δv of about kms as opposed to the kms required to reach leo from earths surface this means that the itstanker could lift about tons of propellant to low mars orbit in a single launch
spacex,not_removed,yes but the oberth effect is at least as strong at periapsis of an eccentric gtolike orbit yeah indeed and i suggested such eccentric launch options in the past as well i misread your question the main problem with eccentric orbits is that they involve multiple passes through the van allen belts by staying in a leo orbit the spaceship will only pass through them once on the outbound leg
spacex,not_removed,true although amos happened during the static fire so apart from mission control and some passers by there probably werent many people watching im sure the news spread instantly though
spacex,not_removed,looks like it was deleted the bot showing it indicates the link is good so deletion is the only thing i can think of
spacex,not_removed,im getting a regular old sorry that page doesnt exist even when vpnd to the us and a content not found on uevlmnkeys link seems they took it down
spacex,not_removed,i dont think it would be that hard to do all the water mining would be done by large machines anyway no hand digging so you might as well use advanced autonomous tech and try to get it done
spacex,not_removed,not to mention the first crew might not intend to come home at the first chance anyway
spacex,not_removed,my thought is the first manned ships will be minimal humans and lots of extra supplies now have it set up so one of them can be a return ship in case of massive colony failure vital materials are already there to keep them going during repairrefit for the return journey this is only for use in a worst case scenario
spacex,not_removed,does anyone know how to get it to work outside of the us
spacex,not_removed,did you try to view the tweet inside the twitter app i was unable to watch video in browsers had to actually stream from twitter mobile app
spacex,not_removed,working in ireland on firefox on windows firefoxs spellchecker thinks firefox isnt a word edit ah no they deleted the tweet that i watched it through last night that must have been an error on their part no geoblocking with twitter videos i guess
spacex,not_removed,working in australia
spacex,not_removed,payload to leo is listed as tons so i dont think they can haul tons up to orbit re the ama theres a very good chance the question wouldnt have been answered
spacex,not_removed,the projector slide in ops image says a series of tankers to are used in preparation for earth departure requires inspace cryogenic propellant storage and transfer
spacex,not_removed,i envisage everything isru specific being installed on the its or in component form to build in a habitat either way the prop could easily be pushed to the tanks via pipelines can enough energy be sourced to cool the propellant thats something ive always been curious about also where is the prop stored while the production is underway
spacex,not_removed,the iss provides a good example of the difficulty of making reliable eclss let alone prop production work in the long term without maintenance they say by adding a seventh crew member to the iss made possible when comm crew vehicles enter service theyll be doubling the amount of time spent doing science on the iss think about that by going from to crew you spend twice the amount of time on science it gives you an idea of how much time the current person crew spend just keeping the iss functioning a mars crew will have to do all the same stuff plus work on isru prop production plus contend with planetary weather systems eg removing dust from solar panels and other machinery we simply dont have robots that can do this kind of work yet
spacex,not_removed,expandable liners would be a great path thin red line aerospace for example has worked with bigelow nasa and builds compressed gas storage balloons some considerations for spacex in planning additional storage beyond a single ship would be what phase they store propellant in gas or liquid and the trade considerations for each
spacex,not_removed,just a small observation using tanks with a radius inside a diameter is only efficient the most optimal packing with tanks is with a larger radius from if one goes up to tanks with a radius the efficiency goes up to i imagine it would also be easier to make and move the smaller radius tanks the higher efficiency should also reduce the number of levels of cargo needed by one
spacex,not_removed,i believe million is only for the spacecraft ie stage not the booster
spacex,not_removed,search engines and generalpurpose ai for use on mars robots are very different problems
spacex,not_removed,based on search input google could pretty much predict anything happening in the world sudden interest into a certain stock could indicate a rise in value and so on this data is publicly available and trust me if predicting the stock market were that easy everyone would be rolling in cash
spacex,not_removed,well musk did start openai probably concluded that the ai explosion is near and he wants it to explode in a good way if hes right then by the time its is flying regularly ais will be changing the game
spacex,not_removed,i think it will just make more sense to use the preexisting crew cabin as a habitat module and use the propellant tanks for storage even if the engines cant operate the ship itself can serve as a propellant depot for the next ship to land allowing for the people to come back to earth much faster than they could otherwise
spacex,not_removed,ive looked into this and its a really interesting option sending a tanker that lives on mars and using it and a ship in martian space would be very doable without any special development there are two major problems the first is that colony expansion will be largely limited by fuel production getting enough power to mars to run the reactors to fill up a ship is not easy it takes a lot of power to create all that fuel were talking massive fields of solar panels or nuclear reactors with this in mind that means every tanker flight takes away one return flight for a spaceship to go back to earth which is a limiting factor in the reuse of the system the second is that while mars is closer in terms of deltav to the outer solar system it doesnt have that great of a benefit in launching to the outer planets its not going to be cheaper or easier to launch from mars for a long time all the extra infrastructure that supports space missions doesnt exist there yet sending all the hardware to mars to then send beyond mars is not easier than just sending it directly where its supposed to go this is extra true if you have multiple super heavy class rockets and distributed lift on earth sls bfr new armstrong there are a lot more compelling arguments for just having an extra bfs on hand that is still flight capable bfs can already transfer fuel and on mars could be enough of a tanker if you really wanted to use it that way near mars operations could benefit a lot from having a mars launched bfs you can deploy and service satellites easily you can send whole missions to phobos from mars easily elons semi crazy idea of using the ship as a ssto suborbital transport is a lot less crazy on mars with how much easier it is on mars you would have huge range for there and back trips on one fuel load you could make trips all around mars to retrieve samples set up additional hardware transport to another base and gather raw materials for manufacturing until there is a supercharger network on mars suborbital rocket flights are the only near term long distance transport system
spacex,not_removed,interesting that it can also be used to faster return trip i wonder how fast mct will be given full tank refill while in in lmo
spacex,not_removed,its up on the nat geo website
spacex,not_removed,episode is available for free on itunes amazon
spacex,not_removed,visit the bay friendly to all outlaw sailors
spacex,not_removed,or a usbased proxy would probably work
spacex,not_removed,try itunes
spacex,not_removed,nothing confidential or even new on the board
spacex,not_removed,id be surprised but i guess its likely talking its meeting or something else
spacex,not_removed,my bad
spacex,not_removed,not everything for isru could be kept on the its at least some things for harvesting ice would need to be on surface then it becomes a matter of mining which is a very dusty harsh environment dust gets everywhere is hard on seals needs to be cleaned off other surfaces or fully isolated might be better to keep more parts on the ground most logical place to store prop would be the same its that is the dedicated propellant factory would obviously have enough prop to refill a single its i assume a full load of propellant is required for tei return to earth throughput of the propellant factory would determine how many subsequent itss can be refueled in a single departure window if the production rate is high enough then stored pure ice reserves could provide for bursts in production for refueling multiple itss or unmanned itss loiter in mars orbit so they can accumulate in between departure windows to maintain a more constant prop production rate or additional storage on the surface of pure and either gaseous or liquid form there would be lots of trades to be had in terms of constant energy production vs accumulated but yeah lots of energy to run heat pumps but all that waste heat needs to go somewhere
spacex,not_removed,it gives you an idea of how much time the current person crew spend just keeping the iss functioning i heard an astronaut speaking about this a few years ago he said that a common story was that manufacturers of equipment on iss would present nasa with two options a the equipment will run without maintenance b the equipments mass can be reduced by if an astronaut jiggles a knob every two weeks option b sounds better since its a minor inconvenience but results in a increase in the amount of science you can bring up but now iss is filled with a thousand systems that need knobs jiggled every two weeks all the astronauts do all day is move from one system to another performing maintenance
spacex,not_removed,the iss has been a great learning experience in a lot of ways about what not to do and where we need to improve technology part of what has been going into orion is a lot of new work on better life support systems its a very under discussed topic but spacex life support systems are going to be one of the cornerstone technologies its not as flashy as giant rockets and vertical landing but just as important spacex has been spending a lot of time already learning about spacecraft life support systems on purpose dragon had life support even before it needed it providing years of head start on hiring qualified engineers and experience with it in use dragon program obviously requires a mature system with proper redundancies that can operate sufficiently long enough to serve as a leo taxi just like with all of their other design choices what they are doing now is going to include how they plan to scale it for mars its been mentioned in the past that one of the reasons we dont hear about the life support systems is because its their own proprietary tech that theyve been developing spacex is aiming for the ships to not require any regular maintenance during missions the passengers arent supposed to need to be crew members for the ships well see how close to this level of systems they have ready for the early trips when the first crews are trained personnel
spacex,not_removed,a manhour increase results in more science where does this come from specialization
spacex,not_removed,yep yep youre totally right
spacex,not_removed,this was my understanding as well
spacex,not_removed,i believe million is only for the spacecraft ie stage not the booster the estimated fabrication costs are vehiclefabrication cost so the boosterspaceship fabrication cost would be this probably excludes rd costs
spacex,not_removed,i dont think so a neural network like our brain is nothing but a search engine seeking for a response that leads to the maximum beneficial outcome your brain iterates a lot you could do based on your knowledge in a brief moment but of course does not maximize it so your decisions are never really optimal a robot could do the same you tell him get me a hammer the computer first searches his library to understand what you want from him and then goes on with its search to find a combination of servo motor movements to get you the hammer i believe future robots wont look like anything we imagine they will most likely consist of very simple components with a large quantity like a swarm of ants it could change its shape to do every task with high efficiency it could form a sphere to roll arround than a pyramid to be very stable on the ground grown an arm to grab something get the something on the inside and form a sphere again just as an example i personally believe an ant colony would be the perfect robot actually what these little guys can achieve with swarm intelligence is just rediculous the can even build a boat out of their bodies and float on water imagine thousands of tiny robots climb on you to build an exoskeleton in case you need one that would be so awesome
spacex,not_removed,also on the natgeo website
spacex,not_removed,only in the us im not able to see it
spacex,not_removed,ah yes scallywagharbournet
spacex,not_removed,yeah got a vpn for firefox and it works now just finished before mars im freaking hyped always get twice as much done for a week after i watch something like this
spacex,not_removed,its been mentioned in the past that one of the reasons we dont hear about the life support systems is because its their own proprietary tech that theyve been developing interesting do you have any sources i could read also interested to hear dragon has life support i know it has pressurised cargo but thats obviously not necessarily full life support again source thanks
spacex,not_removed,that twice as much science refers to only the nasa contingent the calculation is that presently of do maintenance with the increase to still only do maintenance but now and not can do science
spacex,not_removed,if they spend of their worktime on running the iss and only the rest on science in that scenario a additional member can double the time spent on science
spacex,not_removed,i guess its basically saying that it takes full time astronauts to maintain the station on average when they have on board one can be working on the science a seventh would double the science work getting done
spacex,not_removed,i dont have a good source on the first part just what others have said so take that one with a grain of salt the dragon life support has been confirmed from a bunch of sources namely elon in interviews hes often said that if someone were to hitchhike up to the station on a dragon they would survive with its life support even if it wasnt a very fun trip
spacex,not_removed,ah thanks for the clarification
spacex,not_removed,is there a breakdown of what they do in a day wonder if spacex could automate a lot of that away similar to how modern warships have much smaller crews
spacex,not_removed,yes a lot of it can be automated mostly there just needs to be hardware designed that requires minimal servicing long duration life support systems need to be far better for manned deep space missions than what we use in leo
spacex,not_removed,before bot this one doesnt seem to have legs like the months ago past
spacex,not_removed,i hope that they sell a model of the falcon with legs on their website they sell the old version
spacex,not_removed,judging by the size of the drone ship thats more likely to be a model of the bfr
spacex,not_removed,whats smc
spacex,not_removed,i gotta score me one of those ocisly luggage tags
spacex,not_removed,i want one tempted to build one out of pvc piping
spacex,not_removed,since the recipient was smc this falcon model must be representing for usaf httpspacenewscomusairforcehailsspacexreturntoflight mission right
spacex,not_removed,that would be a great day for spacex when finally flies with usaf logo on the fairing
spacex,not_removed,i want one
spacex,not_removed,wonder what scale it i bet it costs a scary amount to make wonder if its made inhouse or outsourced
spacex,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commentautonomous spaceport drone ship landing platform used in this commentbig fu falcon rocket used in this commentof course i still love you atlantic landing barge ship decronym is a community product of rspacex implemented im a bot and i first saw this thread at jul utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
spacex,not_removed,this one doesnt seem to have legs thats probably because they are out of frame p edit yep its painted incorrectlyfor that version as is only right and proper for spacex compare that to this
spacex,not_removed,i put a relatively detailed model on thingiverse it was modeled by eye from photos i learned that every single launch the rocket has a lot of changes i took bits from several to combine into my model i am still working on it but if you have a printer you could use the model to make a scale model the size of the one in the pic that would look as good it is free for all to use non commercially edit
spacex,not_removed,even then the scale is not right but i can imagine they didnt want to carry around a scale model of the drone ship it wouldnt fit well through doors
spacex,not_removed,space and missile systems center says wikipedia why its not smsc is beyond me
spacex,not_removed,really wish they could start selling it at official online store
spacex,not_removed,currently they sell for a pair on the employee store id have to assume that when they make it to the public store they will be closer to a pair
spacex,not_removed,ive been thinking of doing that too i would do the landed version in pvc w printed grid fins legs and engines and paint and decals
spacex,not_removed,the discovr mission flew with one already
spacex,not_removed,looks roughly to me
spacex,not_removed,somehow these pictures always cut out we really want to see the model less of the people they are still important
spacex,not_removed,i like it but i dont have a printer but serious the falcon change for every launch i like the news
spacex,not_removed,pretty awesome would love to see a stage landing config version d
spacex,not_removed,would make a good floor mat to sit the model on
spacex,not_removed,so that later they can turn it into the space marine core
spacex,not_removed,they probably added the word systems after then made all the cool badges
spacex,not_removed,i would not be surprised if it were a case of an acronym lasting longer than the original or concept development name
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,every single picture i found was slightly different each mission had different bumps and pipes the grid fins have undergone substantial changes
spacex,not_removed,i am working on an idea for a smaller version to show off a landing currently printing a six foot tall version for fun
spacex,not_removed,here is the work in progress of the model it has way too much detail to print this small the goal is to put an acrylic rod through the base and the flame to support it then in the base i want to place rgb leds for the flame as well as the smoke then to use an arduino nano to control the lights so they cal flicker and change color to make it more dynamic this project is going to take a while though i am putting some of it off until i am employed so i have some money to buy the pieces i need
spacex,not_removed,an asds carpet sounds like a great idea also great for transportation just wrap it around the model
spacex,not_removed,yea they are doing it hope they keep upgrade the falcon after each fly is the change maximize the change of success or it minimize friction we never know
spacex,not_removed,thats gonna be awesome id love a foot landed stage sitting on the legs somewhere in the house with the soot marks and all im considering making something out of foam core and using the paper model prints as a painting guide or something would love to print parts and do it that way but dont have a printer and in aus paying for prints is pretty pricy for huge stuff haha definitely like your idea of having it mid landing with arduino controlled lighting etc though id be tempted to have micro servos moving the grid fins very slightly back and forth too to give that making final adjustments look damn i need more money and model making skills im good on the arduino side though
spacex,not_removed,i put a lot of thought into how to articulate the legs and the grid fins my conclusion is that if you keep everything proportionally correct there isnt any way to make it structurally sound in a reasonable way i have a design that would rotate all grid fins with servo and extend the grid fins with one servo and all landing legs with a third the issue is that if you make the body of the rocket a large enough diameter to fit even tiny servos and mechanisms it becomes more than feet tall the next problem is that the hinges for the legs at that scale would have like a paperclip diameter pin for an axle also the segment hydraulics are problematic you can get telescopic tube starting at diameter and spring load the piston but making it so the tubes stay nested and limit the extension so it doesnt fall apart when fully extended is something i have not figured out a solution to i abandoned the idea of actuating it all i want to make a swap able bottom for the tall one so i can pull stage off and swap the engine segment with one that has the legs unfolded
spacex,not_removed,just a heads up tvd is without internet for the next few weeks so he probably will be unable to respond until hes back with us edit to not break my own rules my source is tvd directly via the moderator slack thats it for me for the next weeks boys tvd
spacex,not_removed,theres enough information edit actually not since these are apparently a simulation as well oops to calculate actual drag coefficients assuming the numbers are authoritative im in no mood to actually do the math at the moment but you seem more than ready to do the required calculus in order to figure out the drag coefficient with a margin of error based on the lack of precise pressure or wind data for the exact altitude of each point in the flight path based on known mass and the rate of deceleration in the ballistic phases of these descents sorry i cant help more but im half drunk and still have to analyze three more lc filters
spacex,not_removed,ive been told thanks for the heads up
spacex,not_removed,i feel thats like a bit of blind leading the blind if you know what i mean i ran the sims in order to verify a similar simulation cant really be checking it up with another one like that
spacex,not_removed,are you sure that was a sim i thought it was a rendered plot of the actual flight data
spacex,not_removed,its late here tonight but i have a solidworks license and would be happy to make a model how much detail are you looking for
spacex,not_removed,its a simulation theres no public first stage telemetry for obvious reasons
spacex,not_removed,only flight data is the timing of the events at first it seems like its a good way to fix your states with the times but the issue is you have no idea what kind of loads are actually imparted on the vehicle when the various landing burns are done you have no idea what thrust level they are done at and at what altitudes having done at full thrust vs some throttled burns changes the altitudes of the events meaning the drag could be smaller or bigger while still meeting those timing constraints edit also keep in mind even at full throttle the individual engines have variations in them that changes the thrust level slightly so every engine is unique
spacex,not_removed,id just need fins in life size including the actual grid pattern wont need to articulate so it can just be a solid piece at the neutral angle give or take a couple inches finding actual measurements for them will be tough thanks
spacex,not_removed,well in that case ill redact my statement for obvious reasons
spacex,not_removed,thanks the first model took a lot of finagling with to get what i needed but it was much easier to work with than my last model ill just need to set up the simulation and run it should take a day or two to finish
spacex,not_removed,updated my main post with new results as expected the cd is around significantly more than with the fins stowed
spacex,not_removed,a risky mission like red dragon would be another example of spacexs key contribution to the space community restoring technological darwinism to an industry that had stopped even recognizing the possibility of strategic sacrifice the early history of robotic space exploration is incredibly darwinian httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofsolarsystemprobes of probes were flung into the unknown by the us and soviet union in shotgunblast programs to tease out the requirements of the environment but the reverential atmosphere of the space community ironically undermined that approach leading to symphonic multidecade probe projects that absolutely had to succeed seeing the rest of the cosmos as a cathedral to tiptoe into has been counterproductive to say the least spacefaring civilizations can only be built on mountains of flaming wreckage
spacex,not_removed,spacex is defined by high risk
spacex,not_removed,more on red dragon gerst says nasa spending to support red dragon is jim reuter in talk tuesday said in line with previous estimates gerst well support spacexs red dragon mission with current staff capabilities dont have to add to nasa workforce to support it nasas bill gerstenmaier to nac red dragon nice merging of nasa and spacex capabilities highrisk mission and highrisk schedule for
spacex,not_removed,i think these kind of partnershipsmissions are great for nasa which as a government agency must be risk prone but affordable and high risk often go together at least the first few times you do something so nasa gets the best of both worlds here if the mission succeeds nasa can take credit for helping make it happen but if it fails it was spacexs fault because it was spacexs mission i like it
spacex,not_removed,what are the long term economics behind this strategy a private company cant keep sending million missions off forever
spacex,not_removed,will spacex arrange to use the deep space network dsn really enjoyed a tour of the nasa goldstone site in california earlier this year dsn now is a great status page ref httpseyesnasagovdsndsnhtml i think there are about spacecraft utilizing dsn including juno which is now in orbit around jupiter using solar panels for power as opposed to other craft out there like cassini in orbit around saturn which uses a radioisotope thermoelectric generator plutoniumpowered nuclear power
spacex,not_removed,i keep flipping between confident and worried about the launch window really depends on cadence and when they finally get falcon heavy off the ground i wonder to what extent the might sideline commercial falcon heavy launches to make sure theres one ready to go for red dragon do we know which number fh launch this might be
spacex,not_removed,so for the launch how many chances will they have
spacex,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commentbig fu falcon rocket used in this commenthttpswwwnasagovcots commercialoff the shelf used in this commentdeep space network used in this commententrydescentlanding used in this commentindian space research organisation used in this commentlow earth orbit used in this commentmars colonial transporter used in this commentnondestructive testing used in this commenttransmars injection maneuver used in this commentunited launch alliance lockheedboeing joint venture decronym is a community product of rspacex implemented im a bot and i first saw this thread at jul utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
spacex,not_removed,high risk indeed i think theres a very real chance they will not make the launch date and then a pretty good chance they wont succeed at the landing on their first attempt that will be very sad if it happens but delays are better than sending a mission if youre not ready especially one youre spending so much on
spacex,not_removed,to be fair to nasa the curiosity landing was also incredibly high risk they had more than a dozen pyrotechnics and im pretty sure i remember reading that they hadnt quite finished the qa on the supersonic parachute that it used
spacex,not_removed,even so this is entering a new chapter for them spacexs previous risks overlooking falcon have been demo flights or postmission experiments expected risks not strictly vital to the companys survival this is a highprofile highpublicity primary mission the eyes of the world will be on spacex like they were for curiosity not for in other words this is where the real frontier starts
spacex,not_removed,as a government agency must be risk prone dont you mean averse
spacex,not_removed,a private company can do whatever it damn well pleases until the money runs out a public company well thats another story
spacex,not_removed,yes they do plan to use it as part of their partnership with nasa on red dragon
spacex,not_removed,maybe theyll refurbish the fh demo mission boosters and use them it would be the third launch at the very least
spacex,not_removed,optimal launch window is i think in may theyll be able to make several attempts during that time but eventually the alignment of earth and mars just wouldnt be very good anymore so theyd have to launch in
spacex,not_removed,there is a short window every months for a month journey there are other trajectories that can be taken and some that are faster that mct is likely to utilise but this trajectory is the most fuel efficient
spacex,not_removed,whats with all the failadversity i dont know but i think you guys need to do more software giant fails happen there every single day but eventually you get it right wont be sad consider the very worst that can happen a giant explosion following uncontrolled hypersonic descent leaving a smoking ruin inside a huge crater on mars will still be spectacular waiting again until though that will be tough
spacex,not_removed,the difference is the loss of curiosity would have been an apocalypse for nasa exposing it to every budget vulture in congress multiple red dragon losses are already built into spacexs expectations like the drone ship landings theyll try until it works if anyone at nasa publicly uttered the words try until it works they would face the spanish inquisition on capitol hill
spacex,not_removed,wait so are you saying a private company is pushing the space frontier i wonder what neil degrasse tyson thinks of that
spacex,not_removed,all of that is true but honestly this mission isnt nearly as high risk as nasa is making it out to be for spacex they would be sad and cost a good chunk of money if it fails but this isnt a decade long nasa mission theyll throw another dragon at it the next launch window making improvements based on what happened last time spacex has already protected themselves from blowback by self funding this mission and keeping nasa in only an assistance role its only a test tests that fail are ok its part of development the only true failure is when you get no useful data from the test
spacex,not_removed,well lets pray they make their schedule and the mission runs smoothly this is the first step on the spacex mars agenda and i cant wait to see what will come next september cannot come soon enough for me
spacex,not_removed,it is pretty neat to think people will be looking to a company to perform what has been for all of history a government task not only will they be the first private company to pull off all technical hardware for landing on another solar system body but it will be the first full atmospheric retro propulsion and the largest unmanned mass ever landed on a body that is all pretty awe inspiring if it works
spacex,not_removed,yes
spacex,not_removed,that was the question though how is musk going to stop the money running out
spacex,not_removed,that would mean even more variables for which would be a little scary
spacex,not_removed,failling at a million dollar mission that has no commercial application to begin with could put them back a lot farther than they arent made of money they need this to work so that people will pay them for future missions
spacex,not_removed,fair enough ill definitely concede that scientific failures almost inherently need to be more acceptable than they currently are
spacex,not_removed,i hope september changes his mind
spacex,not_removed,you know hes actually not as anti as everyone paints him you all should listen to his pod cast star talk when he has elon on he basically intros it with his talk with the man who is changing the world bill nye is with him too basically its a nerdgasm star talk is a great listen regardless especially when it comes to space
spacex,not_removed,i am a fan of both tyson and musk tyson as a scientist is by nature a skeptic he has also stated that we need more people like elon musk pushing the fronter of space exploration i hope tyson is wrong but i respect his sober opinion on the matter both men are extremely brilliant
spacex,not_removed,theyre vying for a government contract for their mars architecture so hes exactly right
spacex,not_removed,the problem with ndt is that hes not a historian and he has spent most of his professional life in the realm of government funding he doesnt have the context to understand his ignorance of history and of commercial enterprise and he has all the leeway in the world to continue peddling his line until hes proved blatantly wrong
spacex,not_removed,its only a test tests that fail are ok its part of development this cant be understated mars missions have an incredibly high failure rate just ask the russians or europeans only one program currently has a mars success rate isro people have their optimism skewed by the success of opportunity curiousity and isros mom hope for the best but plan for the worst and gather as much data as possible no matter what happens
spacex,not_removed,thats assuming failures have zero pr impact which isnt true depending on the failure mode it decreases confidence in the crew capsule in future red dragon missions and in the mct architecture my point is that for the first time the test is the primary mission which heretofore has only been the case for launch vehicle demo flights
spacex,not_removed,pretty sure everything spacex does is as broadly utilitarian as possible dragon rd is largely paid for by nasa contract but it can also fly to marsother places falcon heavy can launch larger or more numerous payloads into orbit but its main ability is to boost early missions to mars so far they find ways to earn as they go from the tech that they build while ensuring that everything takes them one step closer to their ultimate goal they dont and wont function like a normal company because of this underlying agenda but that wont stop them making as much money by any means that will assist them to the goal and im with urocket i think mct and bfr will be no exception the platform will have the flexibility to launch leo lunar interplanetary and asteroid missions as well as just ferry fuel to earn some money from ula and it will launch screeds of satellites for less than it costs on it will become their next main launch platform it will do this to pay its way for the real purpose mars colonisation
spacex,not_removed,the goal is to establish capability with this one then get nasa to pay for science payloads for the next one or two in or at least that seems like the logical path sort of like how falcon proved capability to nasa to award cots
spacex,not_removed,it seems like spacex would want to use a refurbished booster for their own mission kind of hypocritical for them not to trust it
spacex,not_removed,i doubt it if nothing so far has september aint gonna do it
spacex,not_removed,i listened to this a while back with great excitement only to have ndt talk over elon at every opportunity hes a truly terrible interviewer
spacex,not_removed,thats assuming failures have zero pr impact i am not making that assumption everything has some level of pr yes a failure hurts but because of the way they have framed this mission it really wont matter itll be just like the failed landing attempts plenty of garbage media reported on the failures but at the end of the day the driving narrative is that spacex is doing awesome stuff and the people that matter nasa usaf dod customers investors understand reality literally the only group to succeed with a mars mission first try is isro and they have a high orbit probe not a lander if spacex succeeds it will be an incredible milestone if they fail it will not mean anything but a delay long term
spacex,not_removed,not to mention it reduces the financial risk of red dragon
spacex,not_removed,hes going to have to come around eventually though im not a huge fan of him personally but then again i havent seen any of his talks or content so i cant really take a stance he comes off as smug and arrogant to me anyway he should probably get a factory tour sometime that would likely change his mind on things
spacex,not_removed,well the format is talking points from interviews that he discusses with his cohosts so thats sorta the point he only has the full interview in a select few episodes he definitely likes to talk
spacex,not_removed,youve said this mission isnt nearly as high risk as nasa is making it out to be spacex has already protected themselves from blowback tests that fail are ok while simultaneously saying if spacex succeeds it will be an incredible milestone so is this a risky mission or an easy one the part i take issue with is you saying that this is equivalent to the failed landings those were nonessential secondary objectives and every anding failure had the silver lining of the primary missions success my entire point is that when the primary mission is the risky experiment the pr game changes
spacex,not_removed,hes going to have to come around eventually though my cynical take no matter what spacex does hell always maintain his stance and will fall back to yeah but nasa funded them at the beginning or yeah but they have suchandsuch nasa contract that is funding them right now he comes off as smug and arrogant to me thats why i worry that he wont change his mind
spacex,not_removed,i think his oft spoken analogy about frontiers states and return on investment is reasonably apt theres a reason boeing isnt doing its own version of red dragon the part that i think neil doesnt get is that you can have an anomaly like elon and space x where an independant visionary is pushing on the frontier as well
spacex,not_removed,i dont like him either but he is absolutely right there is no profit in space exploration the government paying spacex for launches is not private exploration
spacex,not_removed,so is this a risky mission or an easy one i think weve discovered our disconnect there are a lot of different types of risk im not saying i think there isnt risk of failure for this particular dragon landing im saying that the program and company risk is very low because of how different spacex is from a traditional agency this is essentially my whole point nasa looks at the risk very differently than spacex for spacex a landing failure is not entirely a failure they have structured themselves to take lots of risks that have small impact but big potential return red dragon is just another step in that progression i wasnt actually referring to failed mars landings i was referring to the fact that successfully sending any kind of mission to mars is something isro is the only one to do first try the landing component was just referring to how spacex is going so much bigger on their first attempt on anything to mars with a primary mission of a lander
spacex,not_removed,it can be a very difficult but nonrisky mission you could argue that even if the odds of success are low spacex does not lose much from a mission failure its not like the primary mission is to land a valuable scientific payload on the surface spacex just has to keep emphasizing that the goal is to gain data about mars edl and a successful landing is more of a bonus than anything
spacex,not_removed,in risk management you look at likelyhood vs consequence the likelihood of something going wrong is pretty high but the consequences differ if they arent able to launch in time its not a big deal they will go again in years if something goes wrong at touchdown they will still get experience in longduration flight and reentry just hope it doesnt go wrong at launch or tmi
spacex,not_removed,yeah but nasa funded them at the beginning or yeah but they have suchandsuch nasa contract that is funding them right now he would say that because its absolutely true without the initial commercial resupply contracts spacex wouldnt be around anymore im not arguing that spacex hasnt done amazing things on its own but a lot of that has been with massive supportboth financial and technicalfrom nasa and ndts argument tends to be that scientific expeditions are the realm of governments spacex wouldnt be opening up their cargo route to mars if they didnt see an eventual business case for it and while eventually we may see the mct taking humans and cargo by the thousands to mars with no assistance from nasa id be willing to wager the first few flights will have a lot of assistance from nasa if not also from other governments so hes not wrong neither is he antispacex hes just making an argument based on historical evidence and also an argument that advocates for more public spending on the sciences i think thats something we should champion while we watch spacex continue to make advancements on its own
spacex,not_removed,to his credit unmanned to mars is not new ground is not the frontier this is spacex following in the footsteps of what nasa has done doing so more cheaply in a more sustainable way maybe
spacex,not_removed,i do see your point but i also think mine stands a failure to land does harm spacex and their schedule to a degree not usual to national space agencies youre correct that a failure might not set back spacexs technical progress all that much but it impacts their reputation more so than it would for nasa a company is vulnerable where we agree the most i think is that spacex needs to emphasize that the goal is the edl data they need to play it like its a first stage landing despite the reality
spacex,not_removed,the only thing is ndts tone in a spectrum leans more towards casting spacex in a negative light rather than nasa in a positive light
spacex,not_removed,ndt is very clear on the politics culture and economics that have disrupted space travel and his views are almost identical to those we share he understands the need for ultra heavy launchers is paramount in any effort to explore space and getting the cost down to avoid congress bipolar budgeting nasa is going to be involved heavily on at least the first few exploration trips to mars they have the resources facilities knowledge on many fronts that wont require spacex to reinvent the wheel on especially when it comes to manned space flight i wouldnt be supprised if nations were sold tickets for their astronauts and scientists on the first few mct runs if say somebody like china plops down a few of billions along with other support that might wake up our politicians who want to make america great to start cutting checks as well ndt is always using china as his motivator for further spending in the us on space
spacex,not_removed,it may be true but it doesnt support his claim which was quite strong the delusion is thinking that spacex is going to lead the space frontier they have already broken significant new ground and the red dragon mission will go even further being the heaviest payload ever landed on another celestial body by a decent margin even compared to the venera missions that they couldnt do any of this without nasas support doesnt change the fact that they are doing it
spacex,not_removed,ndts argument against spacex though has an issue in that the things he usually lists as governments doing first has already been done by governments over the past few decades with mars so by his logic a company could develop a plan deem the risk acceptable enough to try
spacex,not_removed,true but a fully powered precision landing is new territory and its required for future human missions thats what spacex is doing
spacex,not_removed,sure unmanned isnt but putting a couple tons of cargo and ship onto the surface of mars definitely is new this is going to be by far the biggest thing ever to attempt a landing on the planet
spacex,not_removed,maybe one day but even then that is not exploration
spacex,not_removed,so lets compare these two rockets taking into account their capabilities specifications and the history of their development and see who comes out on top heres your comparison the first stage of the saturn v is way heavier than the entire falcon heavy
spacex,not_removed,hi your submission was removed from rspacex for breaking our httpwwwredditcomrspacexwikirules removed as this is redundant information please check through rspacexnew before submitting thanks for understanding this is so we can keep rspacex the very best spacex discussion board on the internet if you feel this removal was made in error please about the removal of my submission
spacex,not_removed,very cool perspective
spacex,not_removed,this tickles my brain suppose we have established a city on mars what twoplanet experiments eg telescope array quantum something are waiting to be done and could make huge leap in their respective field of science
spacex,not_removed,happy elonweek happy rspacex just passed subscribers to see some more numbers the first successful landing in december also landed us in the top biggest subreddit rank the current rank is around in the sub convinced users to join monthly average in we have grown by already monthly average conclusion the sub is growing faster and faster we havent reached the inflexion point on this curve yet we can easily hit by end of september but i would bet it will be in early october and a reused booster or fh could easily push it to this year httpredditmetricscomrspacex
spacex,not_removed,what are the reasons they keep all the bfrmct details secret no official numbers no renders almost no mention of it i see reasons why they keep their manufacturing processes satellite network plans or actual flight hardwere details secret as they can
spacex,not_removed,i know launch cadence has picked up but isnt the once a month they are currently doing still slower than anticipated shouldnt they be launching every weeks at this point to complete all the launches they have to for the year
spacex,not_removed,hey mods would it be possible to have this stickied for the benefit of mobile users when there are no other stickied threads such as now
spacex,not_removed,is there a way we can use the wiki to begin to stash in a single place all relevant stage photos and vehicle data collected from here nsf and other social media
spacex,not_removed,i have three questions do we know how spacex intend to stop the fh side boosters colidinginterfering with each other during rtls these things will be travelling in close proximity to each other at hypersonic speeds with periodic burns disrupting the atmosphere around them wouldnt it be better to send them to seperate landing pads a couple of miles apart rather than landing them within a hundred meters of each other how can spacex up the launchlanding cadance from ccas with the current turnaround period of ocisly without leasing more very expensive hardware i believe ocisly was only in port for around days between thaicom and eutelsatabs launches if thaicom had rud on the barge spacex would have had big problems providing a servicable barge for the eutelsatabs landing attempt will spacex have trouble getting required permisions for propulsive landings on terrafirma i would have thought landing a capusle returning from orbit acuratley is quite a bit harder than landing a first stage i would imagine it will have to land in the desert somewhere this is my first post and im a massive spacex fan i really want to see elons vision become a reality as much as the next guygirl on here please dont take my questions as a negative they have been niggling me for a while
spacex,not_removed,after reading the is anyone else thinking theyd pay money to watch a tv show featuring uechologic and urocket argue and others am i the only one its really refreshing to me to see this kind of debating going on intelligent logical respectful passionate generally optimistic earth needs more of this its like visiting a coral reef whereas watching american politics is like scubadiving in a sewer and not a storm sewer either
spacex,not_removed,how will spacex pay for the mctbfr ive seen people throw out a seat price but i find it hard to believe that million will be enough to pay for the amortized cost of the launch considering a reused rocket is going for million not to mention the supplies that will have to be sent for free the initial setup of the base and the fact that if you only send those who can and choose to pay you will end up with a certain type of individual which wont include the brilliant young phds you will want to be sending only other options i see are hoping that a government will foot the bill for at least a while which considering spacex couldnt get nasa to chip in cash for the red dragon doesnt seem easy or spacex just paying for the whole thing which im sure the vcs who invested would love
spacex,not_removed,not a question just a massive thanks to i watched from a pier and my hat went into the banana river a few minutes after landing but they fished it out mailed it to me and after a mile journey httpiimgurcomebfxonqhjpg all of yall make up one of the best communities on reddit
spacex,not_removed,i dont necessarily have a question but i will say this even as an engineering student i learn a ton reading these and thanks to people sourcing their stuff learn even more reading those articlespapers thanks rspacex mods for doing these
spacex,not_removed,will dragon have solar panel covers to cover the trunk on ascent seems a bit risky to have the panels go through the extreme conditions of a launch without some sort of protection
spacex,not_removed,just a reminder ula is launching a national security payload for the us national reconnaissance office atop an atlas v in a little over one hour am edt utc on july theres a over at rula and you can watch the livestream beginning at am edt utc on or httpwwwulalaunchcomwebcastaspx
spacex,not_removed,has anyone seen this looks like a longer video of the onboard footage that spacex released on youtube
spacex,not_removed,im really desirous of raptor testing stand updates how about another drone flyby please pretty please
spacex,not_removed,rather than future launches what do yall think of changing one of the links above to a subreddit shoutout there are plenty of newspace companies oldspace companies national space agencies solar system bodies etc whose subreddits would certainly benefit from the attention one example is the httpswwwredditcomrjunomission subreddit their layout is a bit similar to rspacex and gives a shoutout to a smaller lesspopular subreddit at the moment rexomars
spacex,not_removed,hi just a note to fellow european fans liftoff currently scheduled for july utc this is cest monday morning so perfect to watch before schoolwork yay only thing worth waking up to early on mondays
spacex,not_removed,just noticed that copenhagen suborbitals are launching their httpcopenhagensuborbitalscomnexo httpswwwinstagramcomcopsub and httpstwittercomcopsub
spacex,not_removed,from rmars the year is and mankinds first manned mission to mars is about to become reality this is the story of how we make mars home told by the pioneers making it possible mars a global miniseries event premieres this november on national geographic follow our countdowntomars at httpmakemarshomecom
spacex,not_removed,spacex the future of space travel is this their official slogan now yesterday utmahlman noticed this new sentence added in spacexs social media bios their description copied official twitterinstagramvineflickr account for spacex the future of space travel spacex designs manufactures and launches the worlds most advanced rockets and spacecraft exception seems to be facebook google and also on their official site httpwwwspacexcom it cannot be found at the moment only spacex designs manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft one year ago there was a thread about the lack of an official company slogan have you seen it anywhere else could this be their slogan from now on will it be printed on their stationery etc
spacex,not_removed,ill likely be stopping by hawthorne tomorrow or the day after to check out is the booster still visible from the street whats the security situation like are dslr photos allowed
spacex,not_removed,today i managed to stumble upon the site of httpwwwpmdtechnologycom which designs propellant management devices or pmds which are used to manage propellant in tanks in microgravity ensuring that no gas makes its way to the engines and gathering fuel from all around the tank these are why solid ullage motors are no longer used a sponge pmd uses surface tension to soak up enough propellant for the beginning of the burn to drive the rest of the propellant to the bottom of the tank if you know that the payload is going to always be vertical then the pmd can be made simpler lighter cheaper and more reliable having it be tolerant of transitioning between horizontal and vertical requires more complexity and obviously a redesign overall i found it absolutely fascinating and a cool insight into why you cant just plop any old satellite onto a falcon
spacex,not_removed,ive been out of the loop lately has spacex been catching up with their backlog of launches from last year they seem to be doing a better job of staying on time this year
spacex,not_removed,did anyone see that there were some spacex empoyees on season of battlebots this year on abc their robot is named escape velocity and theres a couple videos on youtube however they didnt make it very far since they went up against a finalist from season in their first round
spacex,not_removed,so apparently solar city will soon be part of tesla some people appear to think the the next step will be to get spacex as well or maybe having a super corporation such as alphabet for google that would regroup all the elon musk ventures would that be a good thing would it make things easier for tesla and spacex to exchange ip or such eg solar panels battery pack
spacex,not_removed,will spacex be launching mostly from the new texas location or split btw florida
spacex,not_removed,does anyone know if theres a way to still come by the spacex license plate frames ive been seeing a ton around orlando lately and i know they used to sell them but i cant find anyone reselling or even a good knockoff online
spacex,not_removed,we talk about in situ production of propellant and oxygen all the time i get the chemistry involved in the air reacts with hydrogen catalyst yes not really a catalyst but you can use the energy the reaction produces to make it using water electrolysis then whats the difference makes methane and water so you drink the water burn the methane and fly back home on the cheap its a simple reaction whats the problem i can think of several and none have been addressed to my knowledge for one you get water in your gas you get methane and from the in the atmosphere dont you need a gigantic refinery to separate the two constituents water in the gas is never a good thing how big does the refinery need to be to produce and store hundreds of thousands of gallons of liquid methane the longest running reactor sucking in simulated martian air ran for httpsenwikipediaorgwikisabatierreaction and produced a few kilos of methane the mct expected boil off rate is estimated at so you need to be able to produce pounds of methalox every day just to compensate for the boil off assuming of pounds of fuel over days to fill the tanks in an entire year you need to produce and store almost pounds of methalox every single day is this even remotely feasible can all the equipment to reach this level of production even be delivered on a single mct
spacex,not_removed,my biggest problem with this sub is there is too much good discussions seriously the long posts are the really interesting ones but i often lack the time to read through them and only consume some links news tweets simple questionanswer threads im sure im not the only one who cant afford to spend here hours daily so what are your tricks spend a day each week to read through everything not good cant contribute use some text to speech to listen to it while doing some boring housework maybe possible any podcast option i would actually pay to be able to listen to the best discussions or summary weekly or daily any other ideas
spacex,not_removed,are there any shots of the te the day after launch was it marshmellowed
spacex,not_removed,uthevehicledestroyer what is going on with flight club httpimgurcomalysvl i dont think an orbit like this is even possible without interference of an invisible moon
spacex,not_removed,this is probably a very stupid question and is totally hypothetical so if its not technically on topic mods feel free to delete it im curious about total integration time lets say in my spare time i built a whole satellite and had everything i needed to control it here on earth if i sent elon a fax saying i have a big bag of money with dollar signs on it for you how fast can you get my bird in the air assuming that they have spare rockets and have to build everything new how long would i be waiting we will also assume that my satellite follows all of the typical conventions and standards in building it so there isnt anything special about it just your everyday regular old satellite
spacex,not_removed,as far as i know red dragon will jettison its trunk with solar panels before mars edl do we have any information on how itll get power on the surface
spacex,not_removed,did you guys ever see this landing footage from cutoff section its a section from the presentation that hans koenigsmann did after the landing on neaf we saw the last seconds from that onboard camera but there is waay longer footage including how the camera breaks i never saw it on this subreddit since is old already i wont post a new thread incase its new not sure if everyone would want it either now haha
spacex,not_removed,just passed an on just west of shreveport louisiana it was headed east any idea which one it is
spacex,not_removed,on the big interwebs it is possible to find a website where one can follow an assembly of an aircraft ie could this be possible with the cores of i know this would require an inside person to update and maybe this is not possible however it would be a very nice feature also when will we start seeing the first cores for fh trailing away towards ksc since there has to be some assembly of the fh inside the hangar
spacex,not_removed,if ft cores are already sustaining some damage on gto missions how does that bode for mct reusability given the increased mass and surface area wont the issue be exacerbated which is a greater concern heat from boostback burns or heat from reentry
spacex,not_removed,i want to see launch and land where would be the best place to see both also any recommendations for what to do at kennedy other than the main tour thanks
spacex,not_removed,did anyone else ever hear of the saturnshuttle it apparently was going to do rtls with a saturn first stage httpsenwikipediaorgwikisaturnshuttle
spacex,not_removed,can spacexaccredited photographers set up remote cameras on to capture landing
spacex,not_removed,will we ever have a daytime land falcon return cant wait to see the rocket during the whole landing instead of just whenever its lit maybe falcon heavy i guess if the first launch is a demonstration it would be advantageous to be daytime
spacex,not_removed,ive heard that the falcon heavy will reduce its thrust of its center core to while the boosters are attached i imagine this is to keep the accent profile similar to the falcon ya dont want to much speed in low atmo my question is could it be possible to actually make the center core shorter by and add that to the second stage by the time the boosters separate the falcon heavy will be near or already in space so using vacuum engines may increase performance i think this would only be possible with a raptor upper stage because of the need for added thrust
spacex,not_removed,i will be attending the iac on the to of september where spacex will present the mct architecture does anyone know on which day the spacex presentation will take place i have to leave on the evening of the already so i hope i wont miss it edit in case anyone else is wondering you can find the date in the upcoming events table on the right
spacex,not_removed,any info on will it be a reflight of the test fh hardware or newly produced fh did some googling couldnt find an answer only shred of evidence in my memory is talk years ago about coreyear production being made up of x number of fh launches which implies a steady production of new fhs counter point would be the public pricing of fh which is very clearly reusable pricing i cant really imagine them only making a single fh and then reusing that for years just doesnt seem reasonable although building new cores again would take a lot of current production while seems to be getting busy and production is needed for
spacex,not_removed,how big is fh compared to nasas sls in terms of thrust and possible max payload elon keeps saying fh will be the biggest rocket when coming into operation is this still valid edit sorry for being too unspecific and thanks a lot for still answering and for the comparison link

spacex,not_removed,bos new florida factory which they just broke ground on is supposed to be around square feet does anybody know how this compares to the spacex hawthorne factory
spacex,not_removed,i am a fan and do art in the style of van gogh could i and how would i post my paintings of launches test stands landings workers etc very well received on spacex fb group i think that this kind of art as opposed to computer generated or illustrative would expand interest
spacex,not_removed,mct reusability might bring the seat price down to to enable mass colonization but im afraid that the bed price for the housing unit and its life support needed for each new colonist might cost many times more than making mass mars colonization impossible the price of the bed would not enjoy the benefits of reusability since a new one would have to be built for each colonist is there a way out of this some thoughts about the price of martian housing the price of the iss habitation modules or the future bigelow modules is many times higher than the price of the launchers they launch on these are not massproduced however the housing units would not enjoy benefits of reusability but could enjoy the benefits of mass production is supposed to be the price of a large home in the us about sq ft the new colonist will probably need at least sq ft on mars unless the price of constructing a pressurized radiationshielded ultrainsulated closedloop lifesupported martian housing and doing it on mars is less than more expensive than our primitive terran housing more than will have to be added to the ticket price local materials only help by not having to transport the highmass parts from earth
spacex,not_removed,i have a question are there already any specific dates for launches in august i am on my first usa trip then and would love to see a launch but i only have limited time available thanks a lot for any answers
spacex,not_removed,what does the vehicle is in self align mean is it referring to orientation or something else also is the falcon actively or passively balanced on the launch pad after strong back retract
spacex,not_removed,regarding the sonic booms this headline got matt drudges attention as a pr effort would it be possible reasonable to robocall the residents who live in the counties nearby and inform them when a rtls launch is imminent if nothing else it would help alleviate pressure on the system due to unnecessary calls from spooked citizens
spacex,not_removed,is there a website or other resource that allows the crs missions to be tracked im surprised that spacex doesnt provide data on their site about the mission progress a ground track of the dragon the iss would be nice along with orbit info for both status and planned actions should be published such as the next burn timeduration berthing etc the best that i could find is a satellite tracking site httpstrackingferraraspace where you can search for it doesnt let you track the iss simultaneously but you can open two tabs and click back and forth dragon is also called in the norad catalog anybody want to build a website that does this
spacex,not_removed,i was just thinking about the fact that both returning side boosters from a falcon heavy will create sonic booms at about the same time so now im wondering if the resulting httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinterferencewavepropagationmediafiletwosourcesinterferencegif will be obvious to listeners on the ground for example will one person hear both booms combined while another person near by will hear neither
spacex,not_removed,more of a statement than a question but i think its interesting that we havent seen any pictures or video of the landed stage yet aside from the nighttime shot either from spacex itself nasa or third party media
spacex,not_removed,i remember seeing a few comments now and then about how it would be bad for a rocket engine to run out of fuel not for the obvious reason of no more thrust but because it is actually bad for the engines health can anyone go into depth on this
spacex,not_removed,do we have any updates on is it still vertical
spacex,not_removed,what is this cable for and why is it not straight there must be some reason for this seemingly random cable placement
spacex,not_removed,would it be possible to dissolve hydrogen into the the densified kerosene more hydrogen more isp right just something i thought of on the way into work and obviously im sure this genius idea has never occurred to an actual rocket scientist so i figured id put it up here and find out why it wouldnt work
spacex,not_removed,why has nasa not given a name to the sls rocket neither the full name nor the acronym are very appealing as opposed to a name thats epic and majestic like saturn v which it nearly rivals the power of
spacex,not_removed,do we have an idea of when jcsat will launch havent been able to find anything yet
spacex,not_removed,not really a spacex thing but how many of yall are headed to the antares rtf next month
spacex,not_removed,you guys are all so damn smart can anyone tell me why the ssmes had to be rebuilt after every shuttle flight but the merlin on the falcon has just hit its long duration refire what key design innovations allow the merlin to do that any why the hell is nasa wanting to use the ssme then for sls wait politics dont bother to answer that last question
spacex,not_removed,would the first stage fit in the antonov i tried to look up the dimensions of each the best i could and it seems like it would what does mars transit look like early on and in the future does the craft go straight from earth to mars or is it more efficient to transfer to a different vehicle in orbit or on the moon how would these vehicles be taken up assembled and fueled how would cyclers be assembled and fueled what if you miss the window for getting off the cycler to land on mars maybe for the aldrin cycler this isnt so bad your time in space goes from months to years approximately off the top of my head and time away from earth would be much shorter than expected what about the cycler that does transit in months could those be like first class transit could we build of them so theres always one doing transit at every opportunity if i understand correctly how these things work what if you miss mars in one of these can it exit its cycle and take you back to mars or earth is there a vehicle that can come rescue you from spending years in meaningless orbit
spacex,not_removed,is spacex launching satellites as fast as the market can provide them or is there a holdup on their end
spacex,not_removed,thanks to uarijun i have a related question different enough i feel to deserve its own toplevel comment when they claim a price to fly on the mct do they really mean or or is the number devoid of meaning let me explain given the mct passenger price therefore in revenue per flight consider inflation the purchasing power of million today should be rather less than the purchasing power of million years from now mctbfr wont fly missions until late so lets use according to the first inflation calculator i came across it would take in dollars to equal in dollars or conversely the value of in is the equivalent of today assuming a average inflation rate from today to therefore is a futureproof number only if they really mean either the equivalent of today or actually when the time comes i would speculate they mean the former if they assume reusability and innovation will bring down the price counteracting inflation the latter if they figure its too unwieldy for todays conversations to say at least a decades inflation for all the thought they put into their effort im confident theyve already thought about this so i suspect one of these two numbers is what they have in mind im sure curious which one it is though third possibility it could very well be they know its so far in the future that a real number given today is nigh meaningless due to the unpredictably counteracting forces of all of the above and so is merely a realisticenough placeholder and nothing more than that come to think of it when i consider elon time fhs initial projected launch date being several years ago i suspect this might be the most likely scenario elons goal is for the first human mission to launch or so lets use as ridiculouslybestcase scenario for a mission the past few decades havent given precisely but near enough for a ballpark figure here
spacex,not_removed,it is my dream to go to space i have a phd in microbiology and study infectious disease can anyone thing of a way of reconciling the two aside of waiting for space tourism
spacex,not_removed,to more seasoned launch photographers what kind of sequence do you usually go through during launch both times so far ive found myself spending most of my time looking through an enormous pair of binoculars my family owns only taking pictures on the pad and for a brief period after take off edit also is it worth bringing anything to protect the camera from wind during when i was miles away on route the wind was shaking the cameras and absolutely ruining my ability to get in focus and take any good pictures
spacex,not_removed,i was thinking about bfr logistics and realized that if they setup big solar powered sabatier reactors at the launch site they wouldnt have to pay for fuel at all once the capital cost of the reactors and storage tanks was paid for even if it wasnt cheaper than buying fossil methane it might still make sense to do as a verification of the scale of methane production needed on mars
spacex,not_removed,are there plans to reuse the booster that was flown on the thaicom mission
spacex,not_removed,any one knowwant to speculate why ps why is this not stickied this month makes it hard to find
spacex,not_removed,hello i was recently thinking about the reentry burns of the recent gto to eutelsatabs except i did some math using spaceflight and various threads on this subreddit and nsf for specs and and for reference as these two flight were very close the limit of ft one on the right side and not the other i came to the conclusion that the first stage needs around tons of fuel to do a landing without boostback which translate once we substract the delta v needed to do the landing burn around ms for a engine landing that the reentry burn is between and kms of dv is it normal that i found a result so high with that much delta v you could kill the first stage velocity at meco kms for about what i found for this flight meco happened for these launches at km and as we know blue origin can land their rocket after a free fall from km without any reentry burn and with minimal damage and there has to be a more efficient way than killing the speed at meco what am i missing is it normal that it needs so much fuel to land
spacex,not_removed,rumors ive been seeing here for the bfr say it will have over engines could someone give me a layman explanation of why having so many engines is necessary as opposed to having fewer larger engines the saturn v had only five engines so i thought the falcon was being weird for having almost double the engines for a much smaller craft
spacex,not_removed,has the raptor been designed yet is there a single functional testbed raptor engine in existence today
spacex,not_removed,so i was reading new article about darpas reusable space plane but a huge thing that stood out from the quotes by darpas project manager was that it didnt have to be a spaceplane theyre aiming for test flights by and a payload of pounds to a degree orbit at nautical miles is it possible for spacex to bid on this i did see that they were leaning towards a lifting body whereas the falcon is nearly fully propulsive in that residual fuel is needed for any kind of landing heres the requirements for the launch vehicle the project carries four prioritized goals the design of a reusable booster system with launch costs traceable to to fly the booster times in days to demonstrate an immediate payload to orbit capability with cost traceability to the operational system and to enable routine lowcost space access
spacex,not_removed,so i think the subreddit is pretty well settled on the fact that the fh center core is significantly different from stock cores enough that you couldnt interchange them or use reused first stages but what about the side boosters could a reused side booster be flown as an or vice versa
spacex,not_removed,if i were to watch a launch in florida after flying from the uk what would be the best way to do this ive been to kennedy space centre before and a few other activities l but i was wondering if there was any assistance to organising this also as a uk resident is it possible for any tours of the spacex facilities im by the way
spacex,not_removed,do we have any idea how much does the dragon trunk cost since it burns up on every dragon mission
spacex,not_removed,what does august mean as the net date for half so the first half of the month
spacex,not_removed,i saw a neat graph that showed the launch profiles from a few launches to scale i thought it was really neat because it showed the difference between leo and gto launches and how tight the tolerances for gto were compared to leo now i cant find it does anybody know the link
spacex,not_removed,have there been any updates on the fairing recovery program havent heard about it in awhile
spacex,not_removed,dragon hatch open already this looks to be a legitimate source but isnt this a lot earlier than planned like hours
spacex,not_removed,so in the pokemon go tidbit at the end of the hosted webcast the dragon capsule had a cp of is this a reference to the planned date of the first manned mars landings
spacex,not_removed,something i was wondering lately is there any public info about how often that redundant computervoting system corrects errors especially in dragon while its exposed to radiation is it a just in case or is it something that is actually regularly triggered
spacex,not_removed,whenever we see pictures of rocket engines they seem to always have a complex cats cradle of mini pipes that arent discussed in elementary treatments eg in the pic of a viking in the wikipedia rocket engine page what do all those extra little pipes do or at least the main five or so
spacex,not_removed,in and others of the i hear three distinct sonic booms how can that be accounted for
spacex,not_removed,question for software engineers at spacex i wanted to know how long the average work week is for software engineers at spacex ive heard hours is pretty normal with day weeks so thats about hours per day so is that normal since you guys have launches every few months im guessing it gets more hectic towards those right
spacex,not_removed,how far could a dragon carrying person go on earth if launched from the ground to another place on the ground in place of a car or helicopter how far on mars if someone needed to get from one location on the globe to another with extreme speed think eastwest coast or americaeurope or even opposite sides of the world if they jumped in a dragon atop a fueled and ready how quickly could they reach any of these destinations could the first stage always rtls if rockets were considered safe enough to fly over land could this be some form of expensive but extremely quick transportation could the second stage be controlled to burn up or crash into a safe place like the ocean on almost any given trajectory
spacex,not_removed,elon musk has pushed for a carbon tax would this include the carbon made by combustion
spacex,not_removed,when do we get to see the spacexsuit will it be a conventional air pressure suit or a mechanical pressure suit
spacex,not_removed,sometime people talk about pressurize the tank of falcon i am not sure that i understand all about the pressurize can someone help me anyone know how high is the pressure atm atm or higher during flight and during transportation
spacex,not_removed,with the last static fire from the recovered booster whats the status of them all is being prepared for being explosed on hawthorne is supposedly the first one that will be reused but has it gone any static fire if not why did one do the static first aka the most damaged one is doing static fires now before one which had damage on the crush cores when landing is still on the hangar or its going to be used for damagecontrol like or to refly like is already on the hangar not sure if spacex is going to post images from the hangar after every core now that they have less than the last image there to show thanks
spacex,not_removed,ive been reading spacexs dragon by erik seedhouse in which he mentions the dragon having a trunk adaptor to take the unpressurised volume from to cubic meters does anyone have any pictures of a trunk with and without said adaptor i wasnt aware there were two versions
spacex,not_removed,little late for july thread but is it a pretty much generally accepted fact that you will not get an internship or more or less a job offer unless you are a brainlet grad from mit with reptilian dna i mean i know i dont have a gpa im not gonna go to some big school but i still wanna help humanity get to mars i mean i did do high power model rockets for a while got a level but then lost the rocketyes i know there are sae racing teamsdesign teams but in all honesty i dont really like dunebuggys and cars that much currently going to a year college and have roughly credit hours im taking classes this fall and im retaking precalc and taking a bio course as well as another humanity i know ive also been volunteering my time with this one guy who is trying to restore a to flight i dont really do much except drill out rivets but i am starting to get a general knowledge of what aerospace may feel like any tips that could get me an interview or atleast a phone call with someone i cannot accept the fact of staying in retail any longer i swear to god if i have to use one more plastic bag someones gonna get their skull caved in just saying
spacex,not_removed,well that would explain a lot mostly that i am an idiot thanks for clearing that up
spacex,not_removed,did spacex show any interest for venus or out of our solar system missions
spacex,not_removed,re red dragon how would it slow down at mars afaik it has a smallish reserve of propellant which will be used for landing with the superdracos so how will it slow down from interplanetary cruise to get into mars atmosphere will it go straight from interplanetary trajectory to air braking to landing is it even possible idk much about interplanetary navigation and dynamics but i thought any probe will need some sort of active braking to slow down even including air braking before attempting to land how will the brakinglanding phase work for red dragon
spacex,not_removed,dragon the recent photos of dragon on the structural test stand showed it to be significantly taller than the dragon it also appeared to be significantly taller than the mockup shown by elon a while back any word on the chnages dragon has had since being unveiled look at this still from the unveiling video look at the hatch position compared to the bottom now compare that distance to the pictures released last week httpsimgurcomaqoqnc it looks like they have added about a meter to the area below the hatch follow up question it looks like there is pressurized area below the crew area of the capsule what will be in this area will it be usable area for crewcargo httpsslimgnoocit
spacex,not_removed,what types of raptor engine components are being tested also what components still have to be tested
spacex,not_removed,any reason why mct has a planned capacity for seats just a convenient round number or because the designers read httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimarstrilogy
spacex,not_removed,i know its still early days but does anyone know if therell be a stream of the iac conference in september i couldnt get the time off work to fly out there
spacex,not_removed,on what basis are we assuming that the spotted fh core is a test article and not actual flight hardware
spacex,not_removed,quick q what does the mean for ofc
spacex,not_removed,hey guys i came along those spacex caps that you can order in their merchandise shop and thought damn they look pretty sweet but later i saw that you would have to pay to ship one to germany my question now is does someone know any alternative to order merchandise from spacex i have read that some tesla stores sell spacex tshirts but i dont know if that is true i know that there are severall shippment services that i can mail the cap to but those services would also cost around so if some of you know any other way of getting those to germany please tell me i dont mind if it takes weeks for them to arrive i just want it to be as cheap as possible also if anyone of you lives around munich we could make a bulk order or something like that to split the shipping costs thanks in advance
spacex,not_removed,random watching a nova documentary on earthquakes anyone know how well spacexs manufacturing facilities are protected from earthquakes how about tesla
spacex,not_removed,anyone know how the ida will be mounted will it need a spacewalk
spacex,not_removed,how would the economics of the mct spaceship bfs be impacted by the fact that it can only be reused once every two years after returning to earth from mars flightrate is critical to bring the costs down through reusability by the way this also means that the colonization fleet could need maybe or times more spaceships bfss than boosters bfrs
spacex,not_removed,is there an issue with the career website most companies ask for creation of a usernamepassword and saves the informations associated with it i have applied with spacex before but now when trying it is prompting me to reinput prior jobs references schools etc for everysingle job which i am trying to apply for doesnt save my previous info did this change recently there doesnt even seem to be a login area where i can create a profile or maybe i am missing it if it is in an area im not looking at i apologize also i was just curious i was offered a position about months ago but decline because of the paylack of benefits etc the hiring agent said most of the people working here are contractors i am completing an ms in mechanical engineering and am looking to get into an aerospace field will be seeking a phd in aerospace engineering after ms currently i work in telecom doing it work at a company making about an hour i was offered a position at an hour i have heard pay at spacex being fairly low while requiring an extensive workload can anyone corroborate
spacex,not_removed,does a page about the droneships exist in the wiki i know that there are two questions about them in the faq here httpswwwredditcomrspacexwikifaqreusability but what do you think about having a page similar to the cores one but with the dronships i know that the mods are always busy moderating the subreddit but if you create the page im sure that many along me can contribute to creating it and updating it what do you think
spacex,not_removed,i havent really researched this enough but when the ida and ccp are in full swing will the cargo dragon still need to be berthed or will they dock it
spacex,not_removed,hi everyone i have a very short question regarding software engineering spacex so as you all know there is an avionics section and a software development section i was just wondering if we apply for a job listed under software development can we still be a member of the flight softwareor avionics team im going to make a decision between aerospace engineering and computer engineering so your thoughts are really important for me thanks
spacex,not_removed,tried this as a post but it got deleted so trying again as a comment on this thread there has been a lot of speculative discussion that we have been having recently regarding the nature of bfr and mct and whether the combination could be used for other purposes this morning it occurred to me that the mct as it probably exists will be capable of lifting enormous payloads including humans pressurised unpressurised cargo and fluids to low earth orbit it also would have to have enough deltav and manoeuvrability to berth at a space station in leo this would make for a magnificent resupply vehicle for the iss and other large space stations imagine you could deliver more than the entire crs contract around tonnes in one launch it would also be cost effective since all component are reusable does this sound like another money making idea to help them on the way to mars
spacex,not_removed,how does spacex get a rocket to vandenberg air force base i live in santa barbara and was thinking they would take the north from texas after the static fire then though la but the road has a tunnel next to gaviota beach thats too small and the would be too steep and curved i could not find any info on the internet and was wondering if someone could help me out
spacex,not_removed,so i have a question about iss resupply missions the last crs mission and the upcoming one both have a russion progress mission within a few days docking at the iss is there a good reason to have both coming so close to each other i figured it would be better to spread resupply missions out but admit i dont really know the different in cargo between the two
spacex,not_removed,is there a difference between and httpsshopspacexcomtshirtswomensspacexpolohtml im a male that wears size medium and its breaking my heart that its not available in size medium was curious as to whether i can get the female version and if the sizing is still the same thanks
spacex,not_removed,can the mods post a summary of some of the best questions from the questions thread at each ones end i feel like im missing a bunch of great questions that get lost in here
spacex,not_removed,any plans to pave the landing pad with steel plates the kind of surface the drone ship pad provides since the reinforced concrete had chunks of it blown off the last time they landed on concrete and there was speculation if that kind of shrapnel could lead to debris ingestion issues and possibly linked to the thrust fluctuation reported in one of the engines during the subsequent static firing of the landed core
spacex,not_removed,the windows of the dragon capsule seem to light up with orange light when the superdraco engines are running what is the source of the light perhaps the engine components are glowing orange hot and they are not covered in the test articles se perhaps they fill the inside of the capsule with light
spacex,not_removed,many comments that the landing looked very smooth or slow to me it looked like the downward velocity was very nearly constant for much of the time that it was visible on the spacex coverage slowing down and stopping only near the ground if the rocket can move downward at a slow and constant velocity then it could have hovered though there wouldnt have been any point to hovering hundreds of feet above the ground because the thrust needed to drop at constant speed is nearly the same as the thrust needed to hover except for air resistance i compared to several previous landings where it appears that the rocket was visibly decelerating for all the time that it was vertical so it appears that spacex may have improved their throttling capability or maybe the fact that there was more propellant remaining than the recent gto launches helped or maybe a combination of both factors does it appear to anyone else that the landing was at more nearly constant speed than the previous ground landing and the recent gto missions or even better does anyone have video analysis tools to measure the relative speed during the descent
spacex,not_removed,later this year the falcon has even more thrust what wil you think spacex will do with extra energy they can achieve meco speed earlier on gto missions will they use this power to land on one engine on asds or kill more speed before renetry
spacex,not_removed,can anyone confirm that is still streetadjacent and visible at hawthorne will be heading down in an hour to sightsee and get some shots of the booster display pad preparations
spacex,not_removed,i havent found anything else on this and this seems like an appropriate place for the question is the bluegreen flame behind the engine nozzle at due to exhaust gases from both stages interacting i have never seen that effect before and it seems to start as soon as relights for boost back
spacex,not_removed,does anybody know if well see video from the onboard camera for like from thaicom
spacex,not_removed,im sorry if this has been answered before but i was unable to find one do we know if the red dragon mission in will be launching from florida or texas either way i plan to go see the launch but things would be easier if it ends up being texas
spacex,not_removed,on the premise that not everything can be fully tested on the ground what risks does the fh launch face that could result in a rud i assume we will be looking at features not included on a launch eg side booster separations attitude control of boosters
spacex,not_removed,sorry if this a stupid question but i noticed that in the last falcon landing the legs where deployed just a couple of seconds before the touchdown i remember in the previous landings that this happened many seconds earlier is this correct if so do we know why it happened
spacex,not_removed,are we already in extinction level event safe status imagine a situation where earthlings discover an astronomical event that is going to wipe earth´s animal life in some more or less short period if this event is discovered today it´s almost certain that we could do very little about it obviously this has been so for all our history but we are not so far from a date when such a discover could derivate in a worldwide effort to save humanity trough establishing colonies outside earth and this will be accomplished once we know how to build the necessary hardware as the means and resources will be supposedly available in an ele situation no need to have those colonies established obviously this has always been elon musk´s goal from the foundation of spacex and that´s why i´m asking this question when can we say we have the knowledge the technology and everything needed to build that hardware assuming we have all the means and resources we need will it be the day when spacex presents the mct architecture this sept or the day the red dragon teach us how to land in mars or when the definitive mct designs derived from red dragon missions data are finished perhaps we have to wait until bfr or bfs are built and functioning or the first manned missions to mars i don´t know but we should anticipate the day and celebrate it because that day even if it takes a century to build a mars colony spacex goal will be achieved and i would like to recon that day and celebrate it as the years pass note sorry for the spelling error in the title english isn´t my native language feel free to show me any other
spacex,not_removed,if i stowed away in a falcon interstage byo space suit what are my chances of surviving a ride down on top of stage i understand that stowing away would be virtually impossible but i was joking with a friend that i would take a ride on falcon stage if i could and its an interesting idea in itself from my readings and looking at pics there is enough room in the interstage the gforces seem survivable though boostback burn if using rtls would be harsh but what about reentry heat i figure inside the interstage should be well protected but would i have issues with radiant heat
spacex,not_removed,if elon musk says he needs hundreds of this one part by the end of the week but the supplier needs months to make it what do you say to elon
spacex,not_removed,i heard that the magic number for space commercialization to really take off is when the price to launch things into orbit is falcon heavy will be able to launch close to lb at a price of bringing the pricelb to what exactly would we see if this is accomplished are we going to see different things besides satelites gov space exploration missions be sent up as well or would we just see an increase of what they are currently sending up so more satellites mars robots
spacex,not_removed,sravanthi sinha one of our ex google summer of code students on network biology is now hunting meteorites for nasa using machine learning approaches the story is httpwwwtechrepubliccomarticlehowonedatascientistwentfromcodingcamptodefendingtheearthfrommeteorites this is only general space related and not even directly connected to space flight so i hope it doesnt break the rules i could of course make a question out of it like could a falcon be used to hunt down meteorites and somehow save us from them but to to be honest i just think it is exciting to see how students can move into this kind of work and hope you will enjoy reading about it
spacex,not_removed,we have a list with designated ids for cores but what about dragons from to is there any id pattern used for them i cant find that on the wiki not sure if it does exist but being dragon an spacecraft i guess it does
spacex,not_removed,when is next landing expected to happen in florida
spacex,not_removed,how does spaced decide who gets to stand behind mission control is anybody allowed to go watch for example can the cafeteria worker get there first and beat out one of the actual guys who designed the rocket
spacex,not_removed,more of a general launch question but what is the significance behind clearing the tower is it a safety thing or a historical call that a rocket which clears the tower is like one that clears maxq its probably going to be ok
spacex,not_removed,if i somehow managed to stow away on a cargo dragon launch would i survive conversely in an extreme emergency situation could a berthed cargo dragon be used as an escape vehicle i know they have heat shields and are used to return things from the station
spacex,not_removed,i recently learned that this makes me wonder if other resupply vehicles cygnus progress and htv have freezers in them dragon is often known as being the only resupply vehicle currently capable of returning payloads back to earth but it would be funny if dragon is also the only resupply vehicle with ice cream delivery capability
spacex,not_removed,currently riding in a car from omaha to robstown tx any chance of seeing an on the road tonight
spacex,not_removed,what does aug mean in the sidebar
spacex,not_removed,the link to the book ignition from the recommended reading list is flawed does anyone have a new link where you can read it this is how it looks like for me
spacex,not_removed,i asked this on another thread but got no responsethe landing burn on rtls in may was about seconds long while the july rtls landing burn was about seconds long why
spacex,not_removed,got a general rocketry question im not an expert in any sense so forgive the simple languagenaievety but i was watching a few videos talking about how the exhaust expansion improves the engines performance at higher altitudes so i was wondering would it be possible to design an engine bell similar to a fighter jet exhaust nozzle whereby its articulated and can expand or would the complexity of such a system offset any potential performance gains
spacex,not_removed,has anything been said about getting nuclearrated i saw that the rover is getting launched on an atlas v explicitly because its the only nuclearrated launch system or is this sort of stuff fall into the sizeable bin of were going to do that sort of stuff on mct no sense wasting design time and certification on
spacex,not_removed,future dragon tests i want to see it flying up and down in a video but we just have one
spacex,not_removed,shower thought with falcon heavys booster and core stages being planned to land back at ksc last i knew of may have changed would it not be more advantageous to have the core stage land on of course i still love you or just read the instructions i would think that that would be preferred so as to minimize the deltav that would have to be reserved for the boostback burn or would the added difficulty and other factors such as weather in the asds location and so on make it not worth the savings
spacex,not_removed,does the falcon fairing create a low pressure zone after liftoff i was think it would about the size of the interstage
spacex,not_removed,as this is ask anything i was pondering ai and asi on mars three levels of artificial intelligenceai narrow ai artificial general intelligence agi and artificial super intelligence asi each will have its place on mars artificial super intelligence asi is something elon musk has pondered even though he warns that of asi as a possible existential threat elon musk is well placed to understand the need for ai and is funding research in to ai robotics open ai project also as ceo of tesla with its goal of fully autonomous carsnarrow ai musk says that maybe within years the ai in cars will be so safe that maybe we be required not to drive by law the mars city will see a great deal of autonomous ai robotic mining and construction agi mining supervised by humans or an asi local computing power is important as there may be black out periods with earth at time when mars is furthest from earth behind the sun also when the communication delay times are at there longest a core database of knowledge that we take for granted here on earth will be essential for day to day living on mars by the mid vast amounts of data will be able to be stored in small a light weigh modules and be able to easily be transported to mars ultimately asi based systems will be needed on mars an asi on mars would require super computing one near term possibility before quantum qbit computers are still very much in development would be to use the mars colonial transport mct in place of people to send cabinets mars super computer made from advanced technology and each additional flight to mars expanding its capability enabling a growing ai and eventually an asi based system to be implemented as the colony on mars increases an asi environment control and also defence system will be required ironically partially to protect mars from attack form possible earth based asis i would be interested to see elons take on this and yours
spacex,not_removed,does anyone have information pertaining to bfrbfs manufacture and transportation are roads large enough will they build on site then launch how will the logistics of such a large rocket work
spacex,not_removed,mcgregor testing do you guys think a recovered stage is there will they light one up soon on the test stand
spacex,not_removed,if spacex keep growing like this will it possible to see they are run out of satellite for launch is there any guess about how many launches contract have they signed until now i heard that they have more than launch contract is it true is it possible that the people who want to launch satellite feel confident about what spacex do as we know that there are a lot of companies want to launch satellite but they cant because of space launch bottleneck if the space launch bottleneck problem is solved will thousands of companies will own a satellites for them or we will have satellite production bottleneck i am worrying about the satellites production bottleneck
spacex,not_removed,on the mct what sort of weight could be dropped enroute we have people spending months i wonder if they could do one or two midcourse dumps i thought about human waste but then realized that might be important for future farming any other midcourse droppable weight edit dropping stowaways would probably save mass
spacex,not_removed,do we have any more info on the dragonfly testing have they done any droppropulsive landing tests yet do we expect to get video of that
spacex,not_removed,when did the falcon heavy demo get pushed to
spacex,not_removed,so would a mission to jupiter jovian system be an orange dragon and a saturnian system mission be a yellow dragon
spacex,not_removed,this upcoming mars half documentary half scifi tv series looks great and elons on it
spacex,not_removed,on all the statics fires being done on third one today theres any info on what engines are they using for the stage original ones original ones refurbished new ones for all the static fires new ones every static fire the static fires of the landed stage are interesting but its not the same if theyre doing it with original engines than with new ones
spacex,not_removed,ive been wondering for a long time do you think the need for orbital refueling opens oportunities for non rocket propulsion like harp or slingatron they seemed quite doable for fuel if the market exists
spacex,not_removed,in the past ive seen an image of a table detailing deltav penalties to different orbits ie leo gto does anyone have a copy of it
spacex,not_removed,anyone know what kind of tech stack the enterprise software team is using nowadays i know that since their ama they switched from knockout to angular but are they using or and with or without typescript also what version of net and sql sever
spacex,not_removed,was thinking about the fuel margins on launch and thinking about the hundreds of things that can cause minute variations to the fuel usageefficiency im sure they dont do meco until the first stage hits a bare minimum height which is why weve had stuff like running out of fuel midhoverslam but what about the opposite if engines perform at the top end of the margin will they burn for say a halfsecond longer to give the second stage a bit more margin or the they always cut off at a specific maximum and just take the extra fuel as a bonus for landing edit i guess since even a slightly longer than nominal burn means more dv to cancel for landing and going further downrange than expected they probably avoid this
spacex,not_removed,would falcon survive a bird strike during landing
spacex,not_removed,has a timeline of junos arrival and capture at jupiter tomorrow night but does anyone know if it gives the times based on when the events happen or when well get the signal for example the article says the burn is at edt but light takes about minutes to reach us from jupiter right now so does the burn start at edt and well get the signal at edt or does it start at edt and well get the signal at edt
spacex,not_removed,no landing vid this time either and now its not that they needed to recover the barge or anything
spacex,not_removed,so lets say mct can indeed land to mars then how much it can transfer to other planetary bodies ie titan callisto or europa
spacex,not_removed,ive been doing some research and discovered rockets named falcon x falcon x heavy and the falcon xx will spacex actually make these or were they abandoned concepts edit i found this picture
spacex,not_removed,httpsimgurcomaiaxpm created in flightclub and manually syncd axes it clearly showed the boostback timing difference and total stage mission time difference also can see was aiming at a higher altitude and more straighten up approach
spacex,not_removed,hi im trying to think of a cool instagram caption for one of my rocket photos httpinstagramcomcraigvg and im wondering what is the size of the spacex logo on falcon im trying to give people a sense of scale
spacex,not_removed,according to inmarsat will be launching on a protonm in the manifest says its launching on fh in december which obviously isnt happening are they still planning to launch on a fh
spacex,not_removed,when going to mars would the fh need to gain any horizontal velocitydistance since its not going to orbit if not would that facilitate all three cores being rtls
spacex,not_removed,it looked like there are grid fins on the latest soyuz they just stood up are these solar or some thing else
spacex,not_removed,i thought only missions carrying light payloads would come back to but how come during the falcon came back with a dragon did spacex use an upgraded ft version
spacex,not_removed,hey i dont know if i can post this or not but here goes i really want to know about jobs at spacex as an engineer im in my first year of mechanical and aerospace engineering in the land down under and really stressing out about what i need to do to land a job at spacex or similar organisations i know just a degree wont get you a job you need experience upon experience in the field im just not sure how to get that experience i have never had even a part time job so this is pretty daunting you could say for me im assuming there are many employees in engineering roles here from spacex and other organisations so i ask you how did you work through university to be able to get where you are now
spacex,not_removed,those who attended spacex interviews how much importance do the interviewers place on gpas for a candidate with years of relevant experience and a masters degree in the relevant field
spacex,not_removed,so this isnt directly aerospace or spaceflight relevant more of a popculture thing but could anybody else not help but think that astrox in sharknado was based almost directly on spacex especially since it was run by an energy conscious eccentric billionaire
spacex,not_removed,i understand that rtls costs more in fuel than a downrange landing on whatever surface mostly because of the boostback burn what about letting the first stage perform one full revolution around the earth and then braking just before reaching downrange if the first stage speed at separation is not enough to maintain even one full revolution maybe the same trick could be done to land the second stage without a boostback it should only take of waiting
spacex,not_removed,hmm let my try warning speculation ahead i am not too sure on the benefits of experiments combining resources of two planets also we are asuming now that we are that far in colonising mars that we can do non essential construction work telescopes on mars might benefit from a different atmospheric window compared to earth discusses the absorption of the martian atmosphere regarding use of solar power especially lower wavelength red nirir observatories would benefit from the thin atmosphere dust is a problem though it causes a lot of light scattering a huge marsground based ir telescope would be awesome though combining data from two separate observatories on mars and earth that observe the same part of the sky would give parallax information at the same time as timedependent photometry this could be useful for research on pulsating stars or multi star systems the benefit based on what i know is not huge though there is also httpsenwikipediaorgwikiverylongbaselineinterferometry but the technology is in no way good enough yet to work on marsearth baseline i am not sure this will be technically possible at all but it is theoretically possible the implications would be huge with this technique you could resolve structures that you would need a delescope with a diameter of the marsearthdistance for quantum something if you could launch the necessary equipment today i think you could demonstarte quantum communication on a marsearthbaseline today httpwwwiqoqiviennaathomeresearchgroupszeilingergroupspacequantumcommunication edit formating
spacex,not_removed,quantum entanglement would be a good one the effects of gravity on bodies would also be interesting
spacex,not_removed,very long baseline interferometry radio astronomy also doable with spacecraft though if you can deal with such large distances and velocities in the first place quick parallax studies of stars or asteroidskuiper belt objects rather than waiting for months at a time to determine their position or orbit again also doable with spacecraft comparative geology depending on what is found there comparative biology
spacex,not_removed,effect of reduced gravity on various lifeforms should keep biologists busy for a while mars could be good for super long term experiments if something needs to run for a century and you cant have some random political turmoil interrupt it maybe better dont do it on earth super dangerous stuff like nuclear propulsion if a way to safely transport the materials there can be figured out much depends on the legal framework thatll be in place if mars is a somewhat selfgoverning or extraterritorial place it could be a place where some of the rules concerning biohazards or genetic engineering or radioactive waste are different which allows experiments that wouldnt be legal on earth
spacex,not_removed,gravity wave observatories would benefit short arm length detectors like ligo and virgo on surface to complement earth ones and long arm detector somewhere near mars orbit to complement future elisa experiment
spacex,not_removed,i think the biggest one of them all will be observing our offspring
spacex,not_removed,i always think the numbers are neat but havent focused on expanding the sub in a long time now we have enough people the goal for the past year or two has been to keep the quality high despite our size increases thanks to the tireless efforts of the other mods weve kept the worst crap out the main adulation however must go to all of you guys for expecting quality comments and making them too these ask anything threads are always filled with interesting questions and quick informative answers that has been great to see thanks everyone and keep up the good work
spacex,not_removed,omg can you just imagine all the new subs when fh launches landing all three boosters congrats rspacex this is by far my favorite sub and the most well run and organized
spacex,not_removed,i believe they have said a few times that they wanted their plans to mature before the reveal ie they are still working on it the plans are likely to look somewhat insane anyway and if they have to start backpedaling in some areas its going to look bad for them also its likely that whatever they are planning there is going to be a lot of skepticism and they want their plans to hold up to scrutiny after all they will likely end up asking for funding from someone outside their organization and their unveiling will essentially be their first pitch to whomever that might be
spacex,not_removed,maybe they aim to stay in the headlines regularly the big deal now is landing and possibly reflying boosters at the end of the year there will be the maiden launch flight of fh mct announcement in september is there to fill the gap or they are simply still refining the design
spacex,not_removed,welcome to spacex theyre running at about the same pace they were at this point last year this is also the point in the year when sploded resulting in a month pause will be what could have been and spacex will continue their gradual ramp up of their launch cadence right now it seems like payload and range availability are their major bottlenecks
spacex,not_removed,seconded maybe sticky this and campaign although maybe wait until we have a launch discussion for that
spacex,not_removed,i think echo is trying to do that with spacex stats
spacex,not_removed,not possible really there are tight limits on how many images can be hosted for a sub well just need to hold out until uechologic gets spacex stats mission control working
spacex,not_removed,i think they intend to have them land a bit apart at least a kilometer or two ideally far enough that one ruding doesnt endanger the other also imagining they circle back in different directions theyll prob be approaching from different angles so will be far away for most of the rtls flight there will have to be more barges at least another for boca chica but theres been to word about the barge company building anything and idk if spacex wants to make a custom bigger barge themselves theyve commented that currently if the barge is out of service theyd just do a practice water landing yes it will be hard to get those permissions but theyll get them theyve stated that at first theyre just doing dragon water landings so we have years before dragon land landings however not sure accuracy is much worse than a stage yes youre coming for orbit with a higher speed but dragon shape provides more lift i believe the regular dracos will be enough to target as accurately as the grid fina and cgts were welcome to the sub it took me months and months to make my first post dont be afraid of being wrong people are usually polite about correcting you
spacex,not_removed,do we know how spacex intend to stop the fh side boosters colidinginterfering with each other during rtls these things will be travelling in close proximity to each other at hypersonic speeds with periodic burns disrupting the atmosphere around them wouldnt it be better to send them to seperate landing pads a couple of miles apart rather than landing them within a hundred meters of each other rtls landing time can be controlled very effectively by offsetting the boostback burn time of the cores the burn can probably be delayed by up to minute with comparatively little effect on total fuel use one core would have a boostback burn seconds early the other seconds late which would mean that the two cores could land close to each other on very similar trajectories minute apart without interfering with each other note that unlike airplanes whose lift can generate httpsuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsffeairplanevortexeditjpg that can be stable for over a minute descending rockets wont generate long lifetime turbulences so theoretically the trajectories might even cross each other but to play it safe spacex would likely keep the trajectories separated in a direction perpendicular to the high and low altitude wind direction vectors or further upwind
spacex,not_removed,how can spacex up the launchlanding cadance from ccas with the current turnaround period of ocisly without leasing more very expensive hardware i believe ocisly was only in port for around days between thaicom and eutelsatabs launches if thaicom had rud on the barge spacex would have had big problems providing a servicable barge for the eutelsatabs landing attempt i think one launch a week is possible with one asds on average a lot of flights will do rtls they need to space them to optimize asds use permission for propulsive landing is not the problem imo they can get it see how few landings it took to get permission for falcon which is much bigger and has more fuel what they need is approval of nasa to declare it safe for astronauts that will take time they will start with cargo flights then switch to crew
spacex,not_removed,regarding point the first stage landing is incredibly difficult because a single merlin engine has so much power that it would effectively launch the rocket upwards if ignited for too long this means that there is a very precise sequence of engine ignition burns that must happen in the last few seconds so that velocity can be decreased as close as possible to precisely at the height of the barge all of this while managing lateral velocity and staying upright the term hoverslam is often used for this type of landing dragon should have an easier time landing it can hover due to deep throttling capabilities and the smaller engines and therefore has more room to correct for orientation target landing and decent speed
spacex,not_removed,one goes left one goes right dont pay attention to the pr video of them all landing at the same pad likely center will land at sea and the boosters at two different lzs if they want week cadence theyll need a lot more rtls or more asdss elon hopesintends to increase capabilities such that theres fewer sea landings its all about the worst case and capsules are smaller and have a short ground track so its not too hard to find a place where its vanishingly unlikely to kill anyone boeings going to drop theirs on a parachute in one of several different areas in the west dragon should be no different probably theyll have to use large desert areas or land at sea though just in case
spacex,not_removed,hah i fear id get my ass handed to me urocket is demonstrably more knowledgeable than myself
spacex,not_removed,no you are not the only one i recently had similar thoughts youtube channels and podcasts mostly cover news and not these discussions speculations analyses would be great to have more of those
spacex,not_removed,how will spacex pay for the mctbfr by making it cheap enough that the seat price pays for it at least thats elons plan as he has explicitly said that price is based on what he thinks people will pay and the hardware will have to make the case close comparisons to the are not particularly fruitful since its still partially expendable and the new architecture is intended to be full reusable the other answer is that spacex wants to make a lot of money in other areas to pay for their crazy mars schemes creating and dominating a much larger space launch market and making their satellites the main backbone of the internet will they hope generate a bunch of profit
spacex,not_removed,the current answer appears to be in any way they can ie by making profit on their launch business and possibly the satellite internet business some people me included were sort of expecting the mct announcement which is planned for september to include some information on the funding picture but spacex may be trying to temper such expectations by describing that event as a technical presentation
spacex,not_removed,internet satellites they with a reasonable number of subscribers at a cost of as little as billion thats optimistic but theoretically possible
spacex,not_removed,considering a reused rocket is going for million isnt going to be fully reusable at least in the nearish future second stage and possibly fairings are a decent chunk of the price the parts that are reusable will probably be harder to reuse than bfr methalox engines at least in theory should survive more cycles without refurbishment than kerolox engines and its likely that they will make several other design changes based on lessons learned from and supposedly that million dollar figure includes a fairly significant profit margin which will be put towards further development they have no competition on price so they can charge much more than their actual costs without losing customers it doesnt seem terribly unreasonable that bfrmct could cost less than and have a total cost for each launch campaign launches not much higher once they get a decent cadence up anyway
spacex,not_removed,if spacex can send an mct to mars for times that estimate then i expect that they will be able to get paying customers to fill those seats at that price per seat per launch nasa could have an mct all to themselves every launch window for of their budget jaxa could have an mct all to themselves every launch window for of their budget it would cost the esa if one ton of cargo is interchange with one seat then thats per kg and universities could afford to send research projects even crazy schemes like mars ones start to become a possibility
spacex,not_removed,i remember your comment its awsome that you got it back
spacex,not_removed,will dragon have solar panel covers to cover the trunk on ascent nope a cover would eliminate all the advantages to be had by moving away from the method dragon uses a cover adds another point of failure if it fails to deploy or only partially deploys static panels dont need to in the first place it also adds extraneous mass that might have to be dropped in the event of an abort
spacex,not_removed,there isnt a lot of things that would damage the exposed panels vibrations gforces would be the same as internally housed panels and airpressuremax drag isnt that much on the nonleading edge any extra protection weight would be offset by the elimination of the moving parts no debris or object strikes would occur at the top of the rocket as opposed to hanging on the side like a shuttle
spacex,not_removed,i like the idea i am new to the reddit game and would like a visual cue to leo and beo subjects
spacex,not_removed,that was a fantastic launch to watchuntil it wasnt nice reminder that space is hard better luck next time for them
spacex,not_removed,so its basically the martian but with interviews from musk et al
spacex,not_removed,yes it is right behind a fence please get photos of the ongoing concrete work for the base it will be put on there seem to be no photos of that yet
spacex,not_removed,this discusses spacexs backlog in depth
spacex,not_removed,no spacex being a publicly owned company would significantly jeopardize the mission colonize mars
spacex,not_removed,it would make it easier for elon to shuffle capital around between his various concerns and he has thought of this in the past but adding spacex to a public corp would be a strategic problem
spacex,not_removed,i think no they already help each other in many ways for example spx buys sc bonds but they are entirely different industries diffefent business models etc one is ipo the other not one is heavily itar related the other not they probably cant be merged
spacex,not_removed,iirc spacex has a launch per year limit from texas so most launches will probably be from florida or vandy
spacex,not_removed,in addition to the mentioned limit boca chica has a limited number of orbits that can be reached they wont be launching to the iss from there for instance
spacex,not_removed,probably mostly from florida considering they have two pads there and only one in texas
spacex,not_removed,i am a chemical engineer and this is not a giant refinery but is smaller than a normal pilot plant it will still be a challenge to fit it within the tonne and limits of the mct payload the storage tanks are already installed in the mct with their own refrigeration system the major limitation is energy input and cooling as an earthside pant has access to cheap energy and near infinite heatsinks with water cooling towers on mars you will be limited to solar power at least initially and have to use thermal transfer to a very thin and dusty although usefully cold atmosphere to give you a brief summary of the plant requirements i have copied an earlier post here the sabatier reaction itself is exothermic so the initial rate limiting step is the supply of hydrogen if hydrogen is bought from earth then the required tonnes of propellant could be produced in days so the new rate limiting step would be the energy required to cool the propellants to cryogenic temperatures and keep them cold this takes about for oxygen and kjkg for methane the carnot cycle efficiency for the refrigeration system will be about so a realistic value might be so each tonne of propellant will take to cool taking a base installed solar capacity of and average operation for hours per day it would take days to cool down tonnes of propellant the serious power numbers come up if we want to electrolyse water to get the tonnes of energy requirements to produce kg of hydrogen at efficiency are so the solar array will take days for a quick mission packing your own hydrogen seems like a good idea otherwise bring some serious solar arrays
spacex,not_removed,dont you need a gigantic refinery to separate the two constituents im not a chemical engineer but i dont imagine its hard to separate chemicals with such vastly different phase transition temperatures it ought to be much easier than separating water from alcohol for example as for boiloff you capture and recool it this costs you energy so you minimize boiloff by insulating and shading the tank im not sure why anyone would think they can produce an accurate figure for boiloff rates on a system that they havent seen the design for the ground tanks are an interesting design problem i would guess they will be shipped in pieces and assembled on site
spacex,not_removed,i ignore most of the discussion thats how i deal with it mostly because most of these discussions are speculation and dont really add much in my honest opinion many responses are canned responses from previous discussions and they can get repetitive mostly the mars and raptorbfrmct talk most of the analysis discussions i ignore because most often they are very basic first order analysis i dont think they add all that much despite the seeming amount of information
spacex,not_removed,at a guess the orbit is drawn relative to the earths surface
spacex,not_removed,easy answer is batteries until it dies msl has some badass rtg system but probably it wont be feasible to implement within years solar panels neither but i really hope they will eventually design some kind of foldable panels that come out of some holes
spacex,not_removed,it was posted
spacex,not_removed,we saw the last seconds from that onboard camera but there is waay longer footage including how the camera breaks yeah and its much more obvious that the camera cover breaks gradually from reentry stresses for the landing video some have suggested that its just a plastic sheet being torn off either automatically or by the wind i dont think that interpretation holds after watching this segment
spacex,not_removed,any photos if so feel free to submit them to the subreddit the stage you saw was the core destined for flight on the mission
spacex,not_removed,the core id guess it was supposed to leave mcgregor this weekend i believe
spacex,not_removed,spotted it just across the louisianamississippi state line an hour ago
spacex,not_removed,unlikely as inside persons are very limited in what they can share due to nondisclosure agreements and information about the internals of rockets is seen as a national security risk see international traffic in arms regulations itar thats also why youre screened and need to be a us citizen to take a tour of any aerospace company the official spacex manufacturing photographs are usually carefully angled to only show parts you can also see during launchlandingtransport there have been some rumors that the was a fh center core no confirmations yet but even if it actually launches in december we might not see that much movement yet its still months away
spacex,not_removed,if ft cores are already sustaining some damage on gto missions how does that bode for mct reusability given the increased mass and surface area wont the issue be exacerbated if the mct upper stage is going to be then it will have its own heat shield and reentry heat wont be a problem heres the merlin abort system is nonsense the raptors will be good enough for that but the rest of the drawing looks good imo the difficulty of landing the falcon booster is that it has no heat shield only some limited amount of heat protection so spacex had to get creative to protect the stage from excessive heat hypersonic retropropulsion the mct will likely be able to kill most of its orbital speed via the heat shield which is a greater concern heat from boostback burns or heat from reentry boostback burns occur in vacuum so theres no heat load generated there
spacex,not_removed,this is very difficult to predict because there is no official word on what mct will look like yet most rumors and interview answers seem to point towards a large vehicle which will go from the surface of the earth to leo refuel there go to mars surface and back and land on earth again such a monolithic ship would potentially be one of the simpler and cheaper designs to operate and maintain but its a fairly blunt approach which might lack efficiency or comfort compared to a dockable ferry or cycler i can imagine that the final plan might be a compromise a simple design which will land and launch at mars but wont land back on earth again instead being serviced in leo by a bunch of dragons for the next trip but again its very difficult to predict without more confirmations from spacex however if it is a monolithic bruteforce earthmarsearth surfacetosurface ship it might look more like an oversized capsule instead of a cylindrical tube it will have a proper heat shield which would protect it during earth reentry stages do not have full heat shields and their surface doesnt taper back towards one end if the refuelinleo rumor is correct the bfr stage will also have a small advantage when it comes to reusability mct will only have to be boosted to leo and the mct craft can function as the upper stage which can do a lot of work on its own making it easier for the giant bfr stage to do a safe rtls
spacex,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrspacexwikifaqwatching
spacex,not_removed,i believe the next crs mission is expected to be the next rtls opportunity and it will be a daytime launchlanding
spacex,not_removed,its all to do with the orbits so its pretty much chance actually
spacex,not_removed,just falcon heavy the refers to engines on a single core fh would have to be falcon heavy
spacex,not_removed,unfortunately this isnt like ksp and having a falcon like core is more convenient otherwise you would have to change the strongback and lots of equipment
spacex,not_removed,they will likely throttle the center core down while keeping the side boosters at near full thrust during maxq when they throttle down anyways this will keep more fuel in the center core which provides more staging as already explained in other replies they dont want the center core to be shorter it adds manufacturing complexity to have different tank sizes for all the different stage cores variants expendable is due to how the side boosters attach to the center core and transfers loads to it is that during landing attempts having a similar center core will allow it to be aerodynamically the same as regular falcon and similar to the side boosters in addition the characteristics of the grid fins at that height will be better known this means the descent trajectories will be better modelled and can be chosen more optimally the size of the stage would have to be increased which also adds manufacturing complexity the stage is somewhat sized to the performance of the vac adding weight to the stage means twr is reduced this is not as important in the stage but the center stage will need to put the stage at a slightly higher altitude before separation all in all im not sure what is more efficient but since vac is not a very high performing upper stage engine then having it push more mass is not desirable keep in mind that when fuel is almost exhausted it will be carrying more tank weight so the performance at that time will be reduced greatly every extra amount of mass that the stage has reduces payload by nearly the same amount
spacex,not_removed,you dont seem to be here as attendee httpswwwredditcomrspacexwikicommunity would you mind if i add you
spacex,not_removed,lucky its tuesday i got multiple confirmations about this in email event is called last breaking news and will be after lunch also in one email it was no livestream and an other it was not yet decided
spacex,not_removed,i would think the reuse of the fh demo cores depends on how well they can figure out reuse of which they have yet to do
spacex,not_removed,yes it is valid because first flight of fh is scheduled before sls firs start of sls block capacity of tons to leo is scheduled for november fh with capacity somewhere above tons is scheduled to fly before end of it will have higher payload than all operational launchers until sls starts flying more info here httpsenwikipediaorgwikicomparisonoforbitallaunchsystems
spacex,not_removed,falcon heavy will be able to lift ca kg to leo sls carries ca so sls is quite a bit more powerful and would indeed exceed fh on the ranking list however sls wont be flying before the end of with a bit of luck we could see a falcon heavy fly this year so when fh will come into operation it will still be the most powerful rocket in operation
spacex,not_removed,answering your second question first since fh is planning to launch within the year and slss first launch is still over two years away the sls isnt a competitor when fh comes into operation in terms of biggest the fh weighs half as much as a saturn v at launch based on wikipedia which may not be the most up to date source and about twice as much as anything currently flying it will almost certainly be the biggest launch vehicle when it first comes into operations the initial configuration of the sls the socalled block version has an on paper capacity to put tons into leo i say on paper because its not designed to do that its designed to launch an unmanned orion to the moon it can launch at least tons into a translunar injection orbit spacex doesnt list a payload capacity for translunar injection with the falcon heavy but since it can launch less than that to a geostationary transfer orbit chances are the sls is more powerful
spacex,not_removed,thrust where at sea level with solid rocket boosters in a vacuum max possibly payload to what orbit fh will be indeed be the most powerful rocket in terms of liftoff thrust when it comes into operation but it will be superseded by sls before hopefully being overtaken by bfr shortly after fh delivers some to leo in an expendable configuration the first sls flight is baselined for to leo but will be capable of
spacex,not_removed,will the rumored leo sat fleet by spacex be able to be a replacement for the deep space network for communication with mars not by default but technically a couple of transponders per satellite could be reserved to relay communications with nonterrestrial radio sources such as orbiting spacecraft some of those orbiting spacecraft could be space based radio andor laser relay stations towards mars the leo orbiters themselves are probably not suited to communicate with mars they are orbiting once every two hours or so and any antenna communicating with mars would have to be turned continuously at a pretty rapid pace and i doubt the satellites will have any moving parts nor will they have the dish size required for dsnalike communications access to mars
spacex,not_removed,no small antennas pointed at earth in fast orbits entirely the wrong thing for interplanetary communication
spacex,not_removed,the spacex web site states from to accommodate a high production rate the facilitys manufacturing footprint has more than doubled to almost million sq ft for a production rate of up to cores annually this includes production capacity for engines blue origin builds their engines at a separate location so core throughput could be comparable incidentally we should respect their very strong preference not to be called bo for obvious reasons
spacex,not_removed,we are still weeks until any rocket stuff gets done this week even spacex employees are on vacation so likely nothing interesting will happen its a perfect time for this kind of stuff i think you are welcome to post a link to an album if you would like to share your work an imgur album is the standard but i think the mods wont kill you for posting any other link your post can get a nice community content flair too just dont post it weekly because that would become spammy quickly
spacex,not_removed,i suspect early martian life is going to be a lot more cramped and spartan than you are currently estimating for a large us house we can build sheds that a person could live in safe from the elements for think somewhere between living space in a submarine person to living space in a dorm most areas beside your bed are going to be common areas in a submarine beds are timeshared based on shifts you arent going to have your own kitchen or even your own toilet not for the first decade anyways a private toilet might cost once on planet construction gets started you might have huuuuge amounts of cheap space available but no one would have stuff so maybe you can afford a bedroom but all you get is one blanket and one pillow and a hammock to put in it anything shipped from earth would be prohibitively expensive like that big screen tv might be to stick in your room a dresser filled with clothes could be several times that a few years later we might be able to produce dumb goods like a dresser for a mere or so and it might be ugly but that price drop would come from using local materials instead shipping stuff a million km through space clothes would probably start getting made locally soon after theyd certainly be ugly and uncomfortable but i guess itd spawn martian fashion anyways and people wearing earth clothes would just seem weird on mars
spacex,not_removed,unless the price of constructing a pressurized radiationshielded ultrainsulated closedloop lifesupported martian housing and doing it on mars is less than more expensive than our primitive terran housing more than will have to be added to the ticket price its not iss or bigelow that you should imagine when building homes on the surface of mars build a glass dome over the entry to an otherwise closed and fill the airtight cavity with air produced out of and produced from martian resources create concrete in bulk quantities from surface materials and create thick walls the only real radiation worry on the surface of mars is uv light so those martian homes could even have windows melt homes into permanently frozen water lakes and seas on the surface of mars a thick layer of ice is excellent protection from basically anything theres even a large frozen lake in the on elysium planitia very nice name btw trying to replicate the iss or even a bigelow module on the surface of mars is a misguided concept those are lightweight structures that meant to be launched into space martian housing will be created from local resources
spacex,not_removed,well there is the whole mortality issue which might make beds reusable but beyond that from the comments mr musk has made so far indicate that for each colonist mct mass would need to accompany each flight and presumably he has calculated that into his seat price it would seem odd if he did not
spacex,not_removed,it probably refers to imu alignment the position reference for the navigation computer
spacex,not_removed,also is the falcon actively or passively balanced on the launch pad after strong back retract its secured to the pad so they can check the engine performance before release
spacex,not_removed,hans said that the sonic boom of the shuttle was well known to the people so nobody did anything regarding calls he went on to say that people will get used to it in the same way ah the falcon is coming back apparently the sonic booms are different reference post launch press conference
spacex,not_removed,the wikipedia article on httpsenwikipediaorgwikisonicboom shows a double sonic boom as an overpressure spike followed shortly later about seconds in the example in the article by an underpressure spike with associated audio frequency noise the pressure spikes are what can potentially damage buildings and injure people if theyre too strong for instance from an sst aircraft or missile flying close to the ground and the noise is what the ears can hear if two boosters call them left booster and right booster fly by and if you just happen to be at a location where the distance to left booster is the same as the distance to right booster then the overpressure spike from left booster will reach you at the same time as the overpressure spike from right booster and the two overpressure spikes will approximately add together so you will receive a stronger than usual overpressure spike the same thing with the underpressure spike – the spikes from the two boosters will add together so if youre at a location where the two boosters are the same distance from you then you should experience a stronger than usual doubleboom pressure spike maybe nearly double strength if the distances are exactly equal and tapering off to the sides where the distances arent exactly equal the pressure spikes will be longer in duration but not twice as intense the collection of all points that are equidistant from the two boosters forms a geometric plane and that plane will intersect the surface of the earth in a line so along a line on the earth the pressure spikes from the two boosters will arrive at the same time and reinforce one another big double boom as you move further away from the line of maximum reinforcement you will eventually reach a location where the difference in distance to the two boosters will be equal to the distance sound can travel in the time between the overpressure spike and the underpressure spike at that location assuming for example that left booster is the closer one the trailing underpressure spike from left booster will reach you at the same time as the leading overpressure spike from right booster reaches you and those two pressure spikes will partially cancel each other out so what you will experience will be a normalstrength overpressure boom followed by possibly a weak pressure spike or maybe none at all followed by a normalstrength underpressure boom this will seem to be a double boom but with the interval between the two booms twice as long as you would get with just one booster or maybe a triple boom but with the second boom weaker than the first and third booms the cancellation may work for the pressure peaks but i dont think it would work for the complex audible noise so i think what you would hear as opposed to the pressure spikes you might feel at these locations is a triple boom with the second boom slightly louder than the first and third booms only slightly louder because hearing response is logarithmic so twice as much noise energy means it sounds less than twice as loud as you get even further from the line of equal distance to the two boosters you just get two double booms one from each booster the details depend on the exact profile of the sonic boom if the falcon booster doesnt produce a double boom then there wont be any location where you hear a triple boom but there should still be a line along the ground where the pressure waves from the two boosters reinforce one another i expect that the system was designed so that even the reinforced boom will not cause any damage sorry for the long answer edit an article in the discusses the spacex application to have two additional landing pads at at cape canaveral air force station so they can land all three boosters from a falcon heavy if they want to the article states that this could result in three sonic booms or one big boom depending on the location of the boosters i believe hans koenigsmann of spacex mentioned in the monday press conference that a falcon booster produces a single boom instead of a double boom like the shuttle so that would be consistent with the analysis i did above in the more usual situation of just the left and right boosters landing at almost everyone in the region would hear two booms one from each booster as describes but the people along a narrow line would hear a single louder boom i heard the double boom of a space shuttle landing once a happy memory from the shuttle era
spacex,not_removed,keep in mind that a sonic boom isnt a single blast but a cone that follow the moving object two cones would certainly intersect but i dont think the sound would disappear anywhere it would be two consecutive booms like two overlapping expanding rings theres also echo
spacex,not_removed,i literally just posted about this than realized i should read the thread first i totally agree seems really odd but it may be more of a sign at how routine this is starting to be treated though honestly i think its way too soon for that hopefully we get a good shot of the hanger when all is said and done with
spacex,not_removed,the fuel and oxidizer have to be pushed into the combustion chamber at a very high rate something like kgs per second this requires powerful turbopumps operating at over rpm which themselves are driven by secondary engines if the fuel runs out the turbopump will be filled not with a consistent flow of fuel or oxidizer but with chaotic bubbles and offaxis masses of liquid this kills the turbopump usually by it tearing itself apart under centrifugal torque if you really do run a rocket engine dry it wont just be bad for its health itll probably just blow itself to pieces
spacex,not_removed,as of yesterday it was
spacex,not_removed,in some ways rtls is less exciting than asds we dont get a recovery thread
spacex,not_removed,its not straight so it wont break when it shortens from the cold
spacex,not_removed,i think i know this one its probably the landing leg cable which is hidden under the leg in question during the launch when the legs are deployed that carries the signal to the hydraulic pushers to kick the legs out
spacex,not_removed,it seems like the cable mounts for on the right is in line with itself its the cable that sort of snakes around if you hold the edge of a piece a paper to the screen it seems to be the case the cable mounts on the left seems to be in line but lower slightly this may be due to any number of reasons maybe to avoid an area to which it would otherwise attach to im not sure how the cable mounts are secured to the booster i imagine it uses a high performance adhesive or screws theres not enough resolution to know for sure i would imagine that the cable itself is longer than it needs to be and this method allows it to pick up the slack the longer cable may make assembly easier or it could allow for contraction as already stated it could also allow for play during the launch and during high acceleration
spacex,not_removed,would it be possible to dissolve hydrogen into the the densified kerosene more hydrogen more isp right just something i thought of on the way into work and obviously im sure this genius idea has never occurred to an actual rocket scientist so i figured id put it up here and find out why it wouldnt work im not sure hydrogen gas dissolves in kerosene in sufficient quantities but both are nonpolar molecules so they dissolve in principle but something different might work a few days ago i suggested an additional relatively small tank to dope the methalox combustion to turn the i dont think this is a particularly well researched field there would be a couple of advantages an isp in the average propellant density still in the methalox range not in the hydrolox range electrolysis of on mars results in which is then burned into methane to produce raptor fuel why not keep some of that to dope the methalox combustion with counterarguments are the general difficulty in handling hydrogen it needs to be very cold and is very hostile to anything it touches plus it has various nasty failure modes a increase in engine complexity sets of propellant lines preburners turbopumps injectors edit corrected early incorrect guess about kerosenehydrogen solubility
spacex,not_removed,from what i can find hydrogen is only slightly more soluble in hydrocarbons than in water
spacex,not_removed,as it happens nasa administrator charles bolden was on the npr show wait wait dont tell me a week ago and sagal charlie ive got to ask you when are we really going to mars bolden were going to mars in the so weve got the vehicle called were going to name it but right now we call it the space launch system its a heavy lift launch vehicle so it seems that eventually sls will get a catchier name but it hasnt been decided yet
spacex,not_removed,can anyone tell me why the ssmes had to be rebuilt after every shuttle flight one of the big reasons was httpsenwikipediaorgwikihydrogenembrittlement which required each engine to be pretty much completely disassembled for detailed inspection after every flight merlins dont run on hydrogen so thats not an issue
spacex,not_removed,the ssme is a high precision machine the was designed to be tough from the start sort of like how an car might break down and need to be rebuilt but a toyota just needs a good kick now that isnt an indictment against engines those things are amazing but they have different goals the key feature of the that makes this happen is simplicity without looking up numbers i suspect the ssme has the parts count each one of those things needs to work
spacex,not_removed,antonov width m height m length m takeoff weight metric tons falcon first stage widthheight m length m without interstage m with interstage dry mass metric tons wet mass metric tons an antonov could indeed carry a fully fueled first stage however it would be without the interstage which a first stage is rarely seen without edit see correction below
spacex,not_removed,they have a large backlog they themselves are holding up lots of launches
spacex,not_removed,when he names that price he means a price that is affordable to lots of people if they try hard enough like a highend house or a crappy house in the bay area which is almost a quote thats not really a number worth doing math on
spacex,not_removed,the past few decades havent given precisely but near enough for a ballpark figure here inflation is not a safe assumption at all indications are strong that developed economies have entered an era of persistent low inflation the us has been below the target for almost a decade and europe is even seeing deflation due to the crippling effects of the eurozone so annual inflation up to could easily be in the range or even be lower throwing off your calculation i think its much simpler to assume that elon meant as a rough ballpark figure a psychologically significant number that is realistically achievable for regular western middle class citizens even if they made a bad decision to pick poor parents at birth ie i think the figure is meant to express not only for the super rich you can dream about this too gesture to contrast it with space trips not as a fixed ticket price we should be taking too seriously
spacex,not_removed,if your goal is iss or equivalent and you meet nasas physical requirements go to flight school and then apply for an astronaut job at nasa with a phd in any hard science and a jet pilot licence your resume should end up near the top technically all you need is a bachelors degree in engineering biological science physical science or mathematics but a masters degree or phd in anything is highly meritorious and jet pilot experience is required for most positions including mission commander nasa physical requirements distant visual acuity or better uncorrected correctable to each eye blood pressure measured in a sitting position height between and inches if your goal is to settle on mars diversify while study of infectious diseases might not be high priority there an early mars colony will have great demand for microbiologist to do other jobs including habitat environment life support farming and eventually terraforming probably even more im not a biologist so im fuzzy on the details
spacex,not_removed,have you seen the bio of esa astronaut httpsenwikipediaorgwikialexandergerst the guy has a phd in volcanologie your technical background doesnt matter that much as long as you have one
spacex,not_removed,echologic is setting up a paid subscription service on his personal spacex project httpspacexstatscom its called httpsspacexstatscommissioncontrolabout
spacex,not_removed,the farther you are and the longer telephoto youre using the more likely wind is going to impact your shot even a tripod wont really help if youre those are the times when it might be better to and take in more of the surroundings if you can lock in some sharp focus though then having a fast shutter speed is whats going to help prevent blurring whether youre on a tripod or not and if you are on a tripod and fighting wind remove the neckstrap from the camera it acts like a giant sail for the launch itself i almost always have one shot on a tripod and another body handheld if its a night launch the tripod has the camera with the widest angle lens i can get my hands on for the and im for a day launch i might trade the super wide angle for a short telephoto and get along with the launch facilities themselves for streak shots i dont open the shutter until the rocket has that helps to cut down the amount of and leads to a cleaner shot since im handholding my longest lens i use it like a telescope watching the launch through it even if im not actively shooting its how i captured the most of the other photographers had already put their cameras down and were starting to break down tripods i was tracking but not shooting through the viewfinder and as it started to i started taking pictures like john i keep a laptop handy and generally have an edit ready before the payload reaches orbit then its hurry up and wait until the pad has been safed and we can pick up remote cameras
spacex,not_removed,sequence like my process we have to get to the viewing area like minutes early sometimes ill setup right away then sit in the car or sit outside in a beach chair sometimes ill wait to or something ive seen a rocket on the pad from away so its not as if im excited at that point sure launches are awesome but i am there to do a job at i have my eye in the viewfinder finger ready to click once i see ignition i take a few frames wait for smoke cloud to spread a bit and then shoot dont want to fill up buffer right away after a certain point the shot is gone so i go straight into editing the photos in the car usually computer is in the trunk so half my body is in the trunk so i can see the screen clearly typically ill have photos up for americaspace at then we sit on our ass and wait to get clearance to go to the pad and get remotes let me know if you have any more questions route titusville nah who cares about wind i use a tripod though
spacex,not_removed,if it was that cheap to make methane nobody would bother drilling for the stuff lng is really inexpensive especially compared to the cost of infrastructure to synthesise fuel onsite its not a big enough cost component to be worth the investment
spacex,not_removed,nothing has been announced past
spacex,not_removed,were experimenting with less sticky posts for the next week or two
spacex,not_removed,can you show some of your work and source information please
spacex,not_removed,be careful not to bug the employees it can be really annoying for them to be constantly bombarded by questions honestky most all the information you need can be found by searching this subreddits history for posts in the past and googling and reading job reviews and articles online
spacex,not_removed,if you put your questions here youre more likely to get replies
spacex,not_removed,smaller engines smaller tools smaller machines smaller logistics equipment everything is cheaper more engines more telemetrics more data happier engineers more engines mass production better manufacturing processes cheaper manufacturing more engines better engineout capability can handle dead merlins
spacex,not_removed,elon musk has said they optimize for thrustweight and they found that this thrust range gives the best tw better than smaller or larger easier production may be an additional reason
spacex,not_removed,remember that having many small engines makes it easier to land a stage even though the needs its to get payloads to orbit its thrust on only at its lowest throttle setting is more than enough to slow its descent but make it ascend again
spacex,not_removed,there probably isnt a complete engine at either subscale or fullsize otherwise im sure there would have been publicity about it there has been component testing of various bits including an oxygen preburner component which became the first fullsize component to be tested in june last year given that the engine specification seems to have been finalised in either late or early it may still have a while to go before a completed article is ready
spacex,not_removed,i always enjoy reflecting on this set of goals for darpa because that is so ambitious currently thats even years off for spacex but its cool because its the same kind of launch cadence and reusability spacex is striving for and that spacex thinks is necessary for full utilization of space and its always great to have multiple groups separately trying to tackle a problem this is another classic example of darpa looking for the best tech for an offtarget reason but then sharing that awesome tech
spacex,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrspacexwikifaqfalcon can falcon boosters be used as falcon heavy boosters and vice versa they cannot both the falcon heavy center core and side boosters have special attachment points that are integral parts of the octaweb and structural reinforcements that are built in during the construction process that cannot be added after the fact in addition falcon heavy boosters can not be used separately as a falcon first stage
spacex,not_removed,yes first half of the month no known net launch date
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,at the postflight presser basically its coming along but will be at least a few more missions yet he says it should result in a cost savings but doesnt specify how much
spacex,not_removed,the hatches were opened at pm edt utc its not uncommon for the hatch to be opened earlier than scheduled assuming everything checks out theres often treats for the crew fresh fruit ice cream etc that theyre understandably eager to get to – not to mention the science
spacex,not_removed,that really took me by surprise when i saw on i was hoping to watch it live but i cant complain about an early opening edit dont know how i didnt realize i linked to the same tweet need sleep
spacex,not_removed,first bfr launch i believe i thought the same thing all their numbers are references in the webcast like the or whatever it was jab at blue edit first launch wont be manned and may not even go to mars
spacex,not_removed,we do know that on the first flight one set got out of sync very likely due to a radiation hit nasa was not confident in the procedure to resync it and asked spacex not to resync unless they need it for operation it was not resynced at the time but later the resync procedure was demonstrated and then accepted by nasa that spacex did not press for resync seems to indicate that such events are rare at iss altitude
spacex,not_removed,my answer below is from talks with spacex engineers at gdc and
spacex,not_removed,this is probably one of spacexs most valuable technology secrets i vote for it being a huge trade secret and not be publicized so all we can do is guessing correct me if its false
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,heres my analysis but i dont have a certain answer to the triple boom the delay between the booms are sec and httpiimgurcomuvepodkpng sec in the video you linked all three virtually the same loudness the video description says that it was filmed from kars park located from another clip from jetty pier km from gave the same numbers i wanted to figure out the distance the booster traveled between each boom and maybe figure out what made them but it turned out to be harder than i anticipated the speed was somewhere between ms and ms but of course the speed of sound changes with altitude with a normal double sonic boom caused by overpressure at nose and underpressure at tail went into great detail the delay between the two would intuitively be the time it takes for the object to httpwwwvibrationdatacomspaceresourcessonicjpg but its not that simple the delay for the double space shuttle sonic boom was even though it traveled its own length of m in seconds at mach httpsenwikipediaorgwikisonicboommeasurementandexamples if some obscure equation for calculating the delay exist then i couldnt find is the first stage compared to the booms and is a really cool schlieren image showing the shockwaves from a plane notice how some of the lines seem to be bending it would make sense like the other commenters wrote that the grid fins caused one of them
spacex,not_removed,in thread on stackexchange someone makes a decent case for it being the bottom of the booster the grid fins and the top of the booster
spacex,not_removed,the leading edge trailing edge and stickyout bits all have their own shockwave in order thats the engine end gridfins and top
spacex,not_removed,i cant watch your video because of proxies where i am but perhaps the extra sound is from reflectionecho so the expected number of booms is two and the engines relight near shore twice once for the reentry burn and again for the retropropulsive burn but how high is the reentry burn i would think they would be high enough and far enough that the boom wouldnt be as loud i dont have a lot of direct experience hearing them so i dont have a sense for how far away you can hear them and how loudly the reason i ask about this is im wondering if the existing two sonic booms are already coming from the same source the landing burn and if the reentry burn isnt really heard if that were true and the two booms were caused by some kind of reflection or echo it would be understandable how there could also be three from the same source edit it makes sense that you wouldnt get a sonic boom from reentry because the air is so thin and the stage is likely not going supersonic even if the stage is going very fast the speed of sound is proportional to the density of the medium through which the waves are traveling so it makes more sense that it is different shockwaves from different parts of the vehicle as others have responded
spacex,not_removed,the general cadence has smoothed out greatly over the years
spacex,not_removed,the dragon in the travelled just over down range making it not a particularly good helicopter substitute the gravity on mars is about a third of earths ms² vs ms² so the dragon capsule would definitely travel further however mars surface atmosphere is only of earths psi vs psi so parachutes wouldnt be as effective and fuel would be required for the landing burn cutting into the range if youre interested in hypersonic point to point travel httpmotherboardvicecomreadvirgingalacticwantstoflyyoufromlatotokyothroughspaceinonehour
spacex,not_removed,for a bit of perspective a falcon launch uses about as much fuel as large passenger jets with a full tank of fuel there are around a dozen falcon launches per year right now and about airline flights per day
spacex,not_removed,carbon is carbon and if you do the math infrequent rocket flights and tests are a minor contributor to total transportation emissions
spacex,not_removed,little is known about the spacesuit aside from elon stating that aesthetics would be taken into account the daft punkesque picture is unconfirmed and shouldnt be taken as canon although there are hints that the picture might be true the suits in the dragon demo video looking identical perhaps well see it at iac this september
spacex,not_removed,fun footage i didnt found actual numbers maybe others will know i think its in the range of atm overpressure though
spacex,not_removed,core location hawthorne being prepped for display hif or hawthorne mcgregor being fired hif or hawthorne hif the cape and hawthorne each have two used cores mcgregor has one
spacex,not_removed,yeah its its called the extended trunk and you can see a diagram of it in this image there used to be a rendering on spacexs own website iirc but it has been replaced with a rendering of dragon crew
spacex,not_removed,its always worth a try applying as long as you show knowledge and enthusiasm then youll always have a chance
spacex,not_removed,replied to the wrong comment
spacex,not_removed,if theyre paid to go sure why not musk kinda mentioned off hand that the moon might be a possibility but it seemed like there was an implicit reference to that requiring a paying customer
spacex,not_removed,did spacex show any interest for venus or out of our solar system missions venus not really it is orders of magnitude harder to colonize with current tech levels than mars is venus requires floating cities which while not impossible are much more difficult than a solid surface colony i could see colonization of the belt and ceres before venus acting as a refueling stop to the outer planets out of our solar system no we dont have the ability to send a probe to another solar system currently let alone humans at least within a human life span we have a couple of probe proposals in the works but they are likely a ways off secondly there is no reason for spacex whose mission is to make humanity multiplanetary to invest in anything related to this when their base goal is considered ludicrous enough by most people
spacex,not_removed,httpzlsagithubioinfographicsdataimagesreddragonspacexreddragonoverviewpng tldr direct atmospheric injection trajectory
spacex,not_removed,will it go straight from interplanetary trajectory to air braking to landing yes the craft will come in at a shallow angle to make the most braking it can before using the super dracos to do the landing it will have more propellant than the standard dragon
spacex,not_removed,i know this is not a real world scenario simulation but by scott manley is quite interesting regarding this question
spacex,not_removed,it looks like there is pressurized area below the crew area of the capsule what will be in this area will it be usable area for crewcargo that wont be pressurized its used to house all of the thrusters and propellant tanks those pictures we got of the dragon structural testing were of the pressure vessel so thats not the full capsule also take those mockups with a grain of salt they are indeed very close to the basic shape of the flight hardware but lots of changes have probably happened since the unveiling
spacex,not_removed,last we heard they are testing the oxygen preburner at nasa stennis
spacex,not_removed,any reason why mct has a planned capacity for seats just a convenient round number or because the designers read red mars so i think theres more to it than just a round number humans are tribal animals traveling alone or in very small groups does not necessarily work well for example precolonial iroquois villages consisted of longhouses and each longhouse was home to families or more which gives about people as the minimal stable unit the amazon tribes were typically in the people range as well so its probably a fair assumption to think that isolated groups of humans smaller than people are probably not very stable
spacex,not_removed,eventually elon musk wants many thousands of people to be travelling to mars each transfer window for which you want a spaceship as large as possible i guess was a round number about as large as was plausible to make as the next step as always hopefully well know more in september
spacex,not_removed,no confirmation of the stream yet but rspacex will attend and post live updates
spacex,not_removed,two reasons doing one is standard operating business for spacex falcon dragon and dragon all had nonoperational test articles that never flew and we havent seen one for fh yet timing for a novemberdecember launch they should start building the real articles about now not have one done now assuming a fh core takes the same amount of time to make as a core that said if spacex is confident enough about the changes this might be a combined test and flight article which if and when it has passed the tests at mcgregor will be sent back to hawthorn and be refit for flight

spacex,not_removed,the falcon core produced
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,yeah their shipping really is pricey only options are finding someone selling theirs on ebay or something or get a group of people locally and do a bulk order and split the shipping cost the cape aerospace museum sells flight patches and such sometimes but not the spacex merchandise i dont think
spacex,not_removed,during the launch at vandenberg i remember someone mentioning that it is much easier to predict weather and call delays earlier easier and earlier over the pacific than it is over the atlantic does anyone know why the weather attribute that matters most to rocket launches is the precipitation forecast day precipitation forecasts are about accurate around cape canaveral because florida is a comparatively thin land mass enclosed by two large bodies of water the gulf and the atlantic ocean where most of the precipitation comes in form of thunderstorms which are notoriously hard to predict accurately thunderstorms are chaotic cascading features emerging from vertical atmospheric instabilities and we just dont have enough real vertical atmospheric data over oceans nor enough computing capacity to predict them with good accuracy even over land much of the hard atmospheric data comes from httpwwwuanwsnoaagovfactsheethtm which are not nearly dense enough just radiosondes on the conterminous united states and only once a day satellite coverage is pretty good with high resolution data in both space and time but they are not a replacement for certain types of vertical atmospheric structure weather data day precipitation forecasts are over accurate around vandenberg mostly because theres little precipitation in the southwest compared to florida and even if there is its often related to large distance streams of moisture that are visible and predictable well in advance so its mostly a matter of geography some launch sites are in easier to predict locations than others
spacex,not_removed,yes some have already taken place when each ida arrives the stations robotic arm would remove it from dragons trunk and move it to about cm ft from the front of the pma astronauts during an extravehicular activity would then attach tethers to the ida and manually connect it to the pma the first spacewalks to prepare the station for the addition of the new adapters took place in early httpwwwnasagovfeaturemeettheinternationaldockingadapter
spacex,not_removed,yes from httpwwwnasagovfeaturemeettheinternationaldockingadapter when each ida arrives dextre would remove it from dragons trunk and move it to about cm ft from the front of the pma astronauts during an extravehicular activity would then attach tethers to the ida and manually connect it to the pma
spacex,not_removed,how would the economics of the mct spaceship bfs be impacted by the fact that it can only be reused once every two years after returning to earth from mars technically thats not true it requires much lower δv to get from mars to earth than from earth to mars because its easier to take off from and escape mars so the mct if it has a δv budget of kms with no payload could return empty from mars to earth basically anytime via a high energy return trajectory so the mct could be utilized nonstop its a very nice reusable human rated heavy lifter launch system that can launch hundreds of tons of payload to leo and can get over of payload to geo and lunar orbits the mct could probably also carry low mass emergency cargo medicine replacement equipment a spare raptor etc to mars basically anytime outside the regular year bulk transport mars launch window even if it reduces useful payload from to there are cargo categories and emergencies where those of supplies can be very useful id expect most of the mcts when they are not on mars transport duty to be utilized back around earth somethings gotta lift those thousands of spacex internet satellites into orbit and maybe a new congress wants to stimulate the us economy by paying for a lunar base 😉
spacex,not_removed,i have heard pay at spacex being fairly low while requiring an extensive workload can anyone corroborate it depends what branch you are in but they dont really let you slack a whole lot it is pretty deadline oriented as well so expect some heavy crunch times
spacex,not_removed,great idea ive just created the following page rspacexwikiasds happy editing
spacex,not_removed,theres a bit of a muddle of information out there on future plans for cargo delivery to the iss the contract info we have seen implies some combination of different possibilities cargo delivery with dragon just like the original this would still have the same cbm ring and still require berthing cargo delivery with a cargo modified crew dragon ie removal of eclss gear but still using the nds and therefore would dock to the station this combination would somewhat limit nasa in the size of cargo that could be delivered as some large items couldnt be transferred cargo delivery with a fully modified cargo variant dragon this variant would have a full cbm ring and would use berthing its entirely possible that they will end up using all three over the life of the contract especially if spacex can get nasa to agree to a full reuse of a dragon
spacex,not_removed,if we apply for a job listed under software development can we still be a member of the flight softwareor avionics team yes spacexs software engineers did an ama couple of years ago at spacex there are four separate software engineering teams the flight software team is about people they write all the code for falcon grasshopper and dragon applications and do the core platform work also on those vehicles they also write simulation software test the flight code write the communications and analysis software deployed in our ground stations they also work in mission control to support active missions the enterprise information systems team builds the internal software systems that makes spacex run they wear many hats but the flagship product they develop and release is an internal web application that nearly every person in the company uses this includes the people that are creating purchase orders and filling our part inventory engineers creating designs and work orders with those parts technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what todays work will be per those designsand literally everything in between there are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass spacex is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one which is critical to our success and the team is on the forefront of making that happen they leverage javascriptknockouthandlebarslessetc and a super sexy rest api the ground software team is about people they primarily code in labview they develop the guis used in mission and launch control for engineers and operators to monitor vehicle telemetry and command the rocket spacecraft and pad support equipment they are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner the avionics test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing they catch problems with the hardware early when its time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit the main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume the software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests heres the link to the ama good luck on your future endeavors
spacex,not_removed,iss could not handle that much cargo even the spaceshuttle never delivered anywhere near its much smaller capacity as supplies only for new iss modules iss logistics also require regular runs to deliver any parts that happen to be needed or new experiments but as flights of mct are supposed to be quite cheap it would be acceptable to do with only a small fraction of its capability used i think of something else entirely a bfs could make a magnificent space station of its own plenty of space and payload capacity fit it out with anything needed for a series of experiments and send it to any place in cislunar space for any time desired up to a year or more
spacex,not_removed,speculating to to barstow barstow to bakersfield bakersfield to slo slo to vandy edit assuming they are coming from mcgregor
spacex,not_removed,the russians mostly handle the progess stuff and nasa and friends handle the crs stuff so it doesnt really matter too much as far as astronaut schedules since those are essentially independent
spacex,not_removed,iss operations were originally planned have resupply windows through the year and so its not uncommon to have multiple flights arriving close together the arrival of a resupply flight affects the microgravity environment station attitude control may need to be more finely controlled than usual they might need to adjust the altitude which involves engines firing and you may get a bump or two at the moment of capture so they try and group the flights and leave a stretch of a couple of months in between where the worst vibrations are the crew moving around and thermal effects
spacex,not_removed,womens shirts are usually a bit looser around the chest area for obvious reasons
spacex,not_removed,try sorting by best instead of new suggested
spacex,not_removed,i believe this is some sort of reflectivegold coating similar to the one found on older eva suits its not clear whether this will stay there for the full production dragon but it seems reasonable to assume it will do for sun protection reasons
spacex,not_removed,to me it looked like the downward velocity was very nearly constant for much of the time that it was visible on the spacex coverage slowing down and stopping only near the ground i believe thats wrong its a trick of perspective from a close camera shot if you look at the by ujohnkphotos shot from a larger distance than the television pictures then we can read the velocity of the stage from this single picture at a given altitude the width of the glow around the center streak is the amount of exhaust that was emitted at a given altitude and illuminated by the engine which scales inverse proportionally with the velocity of the rocket that exhaust glow boundary forms a triangle its getting wider at the base with a final phase where it levels off this suggests that the rocket got gradually slower single engine burn slightly throttled down with a final slow approach phase single engine throttled down to the max edit heres the and i agree with you that velocity appears to be pretty constant in this final phase they might have achieved a near twr through deep throttling and keeping more fuel than in a typical gto landing attempt if the rocket is heavier than tons then i believe a twr of near is possible because minimum sl thrust is around of kn which is a weight equivalent force of about tons
spacex,not_removed,no i think you are mistaking perspective
spacex,not_removed,looks can and will be deceiving heres a of the eutelsat stages failed landing to the untrained eye the stage will look as if its hovering when it is actually performing a hoverslam
spacex,not_removed,well i got to answer that question for myself photos to come soonish
spacex,not_removed,i think you may be right i find it hard to believe that youre seeing teateb that long after ignition and in that position in the plume and right when relights we probably havent noticed this before due to the quicker flip manoeuvre meaning plume interacts more with
spacex,not_removed,yep its
spacex,not_removed,probably not since it was a night launch not much to see
spacex,not_removed,texas will definitely not be ready by then it should be from at ksc in florida
spacex,not_removed,most of the unpredictables that used to require inflight testing can now be simulated computationally resonance frequencies material robustness through extreme temperature and vibration regimes etcetera the problem with any simulation though is that they leave things out whether its holes in the data wrought by compression algorithms meant to cull irrelevancies in order to make the calculations practical or the interference of the imperfection of reality versus the perfect isolation of the simulation things can go differently in real life the places i most expect there to be an unaccountedfor problem would be launch and maxq as well as some possible resonance between the descending sideboosters during their nearsimultaneous landing however those holes in the simulations have been closing tighter and tighter as computing power and simulation techniques improve i dont actually expect anything to go wrong with falcon heavy but if it does itll be spectacular
spacex,not_removed,i measured the time between leg deploy and touchdown nothing fancy just using my phone core time seconds from beginning of leg deploy to touching the ground the numbers probably arent precise as we dont have a clear landing video yet they seem to be within a couple seconds
spacex,not_removed,previous landings have been roughly similar this is done because deploying the legs produces drag from the bottom unstable end of the core exposes them to the heat from the engines more and creates turbulent airflow which could potentially disrupt lift provided by the grid fins the shuttle did similar by only deploying its landing gear at the last possible moment above the runway to avoid drag
spacex,not_removed,i think youre misremembering landing leg deploy is always about six or seven seconds before touchdown
spacex,not_removed,it will be when there is a selfsufficient colony of millions on mars
spacex,not_removed,probably not either way the space suit will protect you from radiant heat that would bring said im sure itd be much safer to stow away in the dragon you wouldnt even need a space suit
spacex,not_removed,its going to be mighty chilly on the way up considering youre sitting on the lox dome and pretty toasty on the way down an eva suit could probably handle it though given that times are short dunno if you can wedge yourself in the mvac nozzle extension maybe dont dent it though elon would be pissed youll get extra cold during the second stage engine chilldown but warm up your hands because you better hang on during the flip maneuver shortly afterwards all in all i think youd survive provided the acoustic environment andor accelerations on restarts dont break your pressure suit youll probably black out a few times including during landing depending on your stowaway method the biggest danger might be a scrub
spacex,not_removed,if elon musk says he needs hundreds of this one part by the end of the week but the supplier needs months to make it what do you say to elon elon and his teams are very inventive several months ago sorry lost the source i came across an account by elon of the supply chain issues over at tesla at a time when production rates were lower they had everything they needed except for some usb cables for use in a complex wiring harness that were held up in customs staff members were sent to all the local frys electronics to buy up as many cables as they could find it wasnt a permanent solution but it allowed them to get dozens of cars out the door sooner rather than later and in the meantime they could look for other sources if spacex really needed some parts right away id expect them to be really creative in trying anything they could determine to be safe like maybe buying consumer electronics and stripping parts out of them
spacex,not_removed,are you talking about the trajectory or the rockets orientation during the actual boostback burn
spacex,not_removed,to me reading your post what stood out to me was that machine learning was being used for this application machine learning is a tool like a hammer or a saw its interesting to see all the different ways that it can be applied i wonder if spacex uses it if i were on the spacex team responsible for the landing algorithms i would employ it there i guess its kind of like calculus it can be used in so many different applications but it takes a sort of intuitive leap sometimes to realize when
spacex,not_removed,since meteorites where once flying in space it should satisfy this requirement as long as they stay relevant to spaceflight in general
spacex,not_removed,could a falcon be used to hunt down meteorites and somehow save us from them sure just tell the mostlysuccessful antiship missile the meteorite is an asds
spacex,not_removed,in florida nov in the ocean on a barge in a few weeks
spacex,not_removed,its employees only first come first served by what we can see on the stream maybe the cooks arent interested in it
spacex,not_removed,clearing the towers is when the mission switches from launch and landing control at ccafs to mission control in hawthorne
spacex,not_removed,using some numbers to evaluate the situation oxygen a human in space needs about kg per day for average space activity at a density of kgm³ you will need m³ of oxygen per day you will survive until the oxygen concentration reaches although its not comfortable assuming a starting concentration of oxygen you have of usable oxygen content taking the volume of needed oxygen shows you will need m³ of air per day the cargo dragon has m³ of interior volume so you could survive days off of the oxygen contained if it was completely filled with air instead of cargo carbon dioxide about kg of is produced per human per day source at a density of kgm³ you will produce m³ per day a surviveable concentration is assuming a starting concentration of you will need m³ of air per day conclusion assuming an empty dragon and minimal physical activity you will survive a day without lasting health effects the liming factor being the concentration at hours the oxygen would last hours
spacex,not_removed,if you stowed away in the pressurized section yes the trunk no that would end very poorly and not really because berthing is a very slow process it requires bolting and unbolting the conjoining ports and canadarm has to release dragon from the station its slow and cumbersome used exclusively for cargo
spacex,not_removed,any vehicles with spacegrade freezers mounted can carry ice cream given the expense of spacegrade freezers though id presume that only dragons pressurized downmass can carry ice cream
spacex,not_removed,most likely not is supposed to arrive at the cape in a day or two way to far east of there by now
spacex,not_removed,first half of august
spacex,not_removed,renders fine for me using the link provided try a different browser or download the pdf and view it offline with a pdf viewer
spacex,not_removed,there was no rtls landing in may rtls means return to launch site the may launches were to the drone ship
spacex,not_removed,single engine landing burn in july so it take longer to decelerate three engine landing burn in may which typically are about seconds long
spacex,not_removed,pretty much that complexity would offset gains also the heat and other conditions are higher on rocket engines also the cooling system on engine bells would have to be flexible which would be very tricky considering some engines use the fuel expansion via bellchamber cooling to drive the turbopumps lastly the expansion angle is very important to prevent the flow coming unstuck from the side of the bell i cant remember the proper term for that and to an articulation bell would change that angle which could cause that as well as change the depressurization rate of the postthroat flow which itself causes a new host of reactions and can affect flow stability exhaust densitypressure and the characteristic velocity of the exhaust its hard enough to model the unfrozen flow after the throat for one engine bell to model a dynamic one would be a nightmare hope i didnt get too technical there been reading rocket propulsion elements so all this stuff is fresh in my head
spacex,not_removed,as says its probably too complex there is a type of nozzle aiming to combat this altitudecompensating nozzles which includes aerospikes
spacex,not_removed,we dont know when thatll happen they retired the first dragonfly test article because they did all the possible tests it was good for as it wasnt even a real dragon theyre probably pretty close to completing the next flight test article but were not sure when or even where the propulsive landing tests will occur
spacex,not_removed,yes right at the area that tapers to the stage diameter
spacex,not_removed,i imagine that they would carefully design the rear curve of the fairing so the airflow sticks to the surface and doesnt break away and cause a serious low pressure zone in technospeak they would be careful that the boundary layer doesnt detach
spacex,not_removed,yes elon has discussed this before but bfr would need to be built at the launch location instead of being transported across the country edit
spacex,not_removed,a core is not traveling across country by truck i can tell you that its a near certainty that the major tank and barrel sections will be manufactured onsite raptors might still be made at hawthorne
spacex,not_removed,the mods seem to have an inside source saying that has been shipped there but i could never find a public source
spacex,not_removed,is at mcgregor being tested
spacex,not_removed,absolutely these are concerns there are less than launches per year around the world if spacex increases their cadence to per year at low cost then theres really not much more market for them to capture the term for this is an inelastic market it doesnt matter how cheap you go youre not going to win more business if satellites inherently cost to build youd probably be stuck with an inelastic market and spacexs growth would stop spacex have a vested interest in making the launch market elastic if launches are cheaper it starts to make sense to build cheaper satellites with shorter lifespans they are making a bet on their own success in the launch industry by investing in a constellation of cheap satellites thats why their redmond satellite business is important they believe they can be their own customer and be the first to take advantage of cheaper launches while also creating new demand its a huge bet and should ensure they can scale up their launch operations long enough for other companies to start to produce new launch demand of their own
spacex,not_removed,i dont think youd want to drop anything en route waste would be recycled as much as possible to reduce the amount of consumables needed and the ship needs to be able to get back to earth a lot of stuff is going to be left on the martian surface though
spacex,not_removed,no drop tests yet theyre waiting for the next dragon test article
spacex,not_removed,echo has a source and its also on
spacex,not_removed,recently i think in the last week or so
spacex,not_removed,mercurybronze dragon venusgold dragon moongrey dragon marsred dragon cereswhite dragon jupiterpink dragon europasilver dragon saturncream dragon titanorange dragon uranusgreen dragon neptuneblue dragon plutoice dragon planet dragon cometsdirty dragon extrasolarintrepid dragon
spacex,not_removed,jupiter and saturn are giant gas planet they dont have solid surface to land any spacecraft maybe we will have a swimming dragon to swim in the high density gas ocean
spacex,not_removed,gotcha by hours
spacex,not_removed,original engines unrefurbished
spacex,not_removed,nobodys really sorted out the problems with nonrocket launching which is probably why slingatron didnt make its kickstarter hypervelocity at the muzzle is only one of many problems with launching like this with all dumb projectile launches youve got the problem of hitting the air like a brick wall and exploding into flinders and the additional problem of not being in orbit youd need megascale engineering at very high altitude slingatron is at least compact a whole new payload class and a whole new catcher class in orbit to take delivery compared to extra bfr flights with a tanker second stage thats a lot of work the bfr will already exist in these scenarios and the tanker design should be part of the mct fleet id say that the need for refuelling is brought about by and filled by the same thing reusable rockets
spacex,not_removed,heres a solar system δv map and idealized payload mass table using the isp of seconds with the simplifying assumptions that dry mass is counted as payload mass and that gravity losses are low any other payload table would depend on the exact rocket used staging setup dry mass ratio engine thrust and isp so heres the table orbitδvδδvpayload mass compared to leo minimal leo geosynchronous transfer orbit geosynchronous orbit lunar transfer orbit lunar low lunar luna terra terramars mars low mars low mars orbit with mars landing with terrajupiter terrasaturn terrapluto asteroid belt if you assume to leo then the payload to the higher energy orbits can be read from the last column as tons example falcon heavy has a listed leo payload capacity of mars landing is of that or this is pretty close to the httpwwwspacexcomfalconheavy i used this to calculate the numbers i can update the table with more entries if you need any particular planetorbit listed and corrections are welcome as well
spacex,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikifiledeltavsforinnersolarsystemsvg
spacex,not_removed,because a rocket doesnt have a intake like a plane i would say it would fair just fine
spacex,not_removed,the times listed in the article are earth receive times
spacex,not_removed,between technical and hosted we got fairly good footage perhaps they will release something but the webcast coverage already is quite good
spacex,not_removed,you need to provide more information than that
spacex,not_removed,those rockets never existed and never will spacex moved instead to methanepowered designs the raptor engine and the upcoming bfr mars rocket stay tuned for the announcement on september
spacex,not_removed,daww look at how cute and stubby those old and fh look
spacex,not_removed,the horizontal and vertical scales arent the same its also important to note that flightclub isnt official just fanmade and extrapolated from existing data its quite a bit off in places too flightclub shows the booster at mach at the time of the booster is transsonic callout
spacex,not_removed,using a first stage height of feet i got a very approximate measurement of feet
spacex,not_removed,are they still planning to launch on a fh i doubt it now fh got pushed back again so inmarsat finally decided to switch to proton and i dont blame them id be a little more than peeved as well at this point
spacex,not_removed,i doubt it too many delays
spacex,not_removed,you cant just launch straight from earth to mars or you would use up all your fuel fighting gravity loosely speaking it has to spiral outward because its more fuel efficient that way
spacex,not_removed,the vehicle still has to pitch over and head downrange just like when it goes to low orbit its very unlikely it would do rtls on all cores
spacex,not_removed,in missions to mars the craft is first put into orbit of earth and performs a transfer maneuver from there i personally dont know what the first stage landing plans are for fh on a mission to mars and i cant speak much to how much power it takes to get a dragon fuel for a transfer into orbit but recovery is certainly not out of the question someone with more info may be able to fill that in
spacex,not_removed,they provide stability in the event of a launch abort
spacex,not_removed,please check the faq before asking here
spacex,not_removed,could spacex make a falcon superheavy by mating falcon heavies together assuming a similar increase in performance it would have a performance characteristic directly in between the fh and the bfrmct but would be more adaptable for nonmartian missions costwise though i am unsure how expensive it would be compared to the bfrmct however it would have the advantage of using firststage boosters which should become theoretically the cheapest arm of the spacex launch family falcon heavies mated together are not firststage boosters but right also it all depends on the mating mating them into a grid is probably a logistical nogo as youd lose the ability to do easy horizontal integration separation events also look somewhat nightmarish each side core would have to precisely separate from two or three other cores the center core would have to separate from other cores and do this over boosters all at once only a single failure over connections and probably of your cores are scrap metal thats about a billion dollars worth of flight hardware plus payload down the drain not to mention having to build landing pads mating them into a formation might work in kerbal space program with copious amounts of constant weight rigid in all directions magical struts added but it sure wont work in real life as the horizontal load transfers would be insane 😎 so i dont think this is realistic in practice but i admit that the landing would be an incredibly amazing sight of cores descending on cape canaveral
spacex,not_removed,but would be more adaptable for nonmartian missions and thats probably the main issue what missions would those be
spacex,not_removed,a dragon to leo is a light payload for published payload to leo is almost tons
spacex,not_removed,i thought only missions carrying light payloads would come back to the residual performance margin of the stage hydraulic fuel et cetera will decide for itself whether to land downrange or rtls missions like and require to carry the payload to gto which takes up most of the performance margin which is why all gto missions have downrange landing on the other hand missions like require to carry the payload to leo which leaves the first stage with significantly more residual performance margin to carry out the landing attempt as a result the stage executes rtls for missions like these there will be exceptions to this with their own reasons like the stage landing downrange because of experimental reasons
spacex,not_removed,next time searching first might bear some fruit heres some previous threads on the topic your answer is probably in here somewhere if youre not satisfied check our wiki and search for previous posts not covered here httpwwwquoracomspacexcanigetajobatspacexaftergraduatingfromalowrankedengineeringprogram
spacex,not_removed,um this is the kind of question that usually gets deleted with a note that tells you to check the faq and search for other posts there are tons if you are lucky you will get a moderator paste a list of like threads in this topic
spacex,not_removed,for spacex in particular youll need to conform to itar which means youll need to be a american citizen us person
spacex,not_removed,bottom line nasaspace exploration is not a priority will fund if there is enough funding after other things are tended to
spacex,not_removed,here is the thing until trump actually takes the oath and sits down and starts going over the budget bits we have no real clue on how he is going to change the space program i suspect sls will be quickly canned i suspect he will be either supportive of mct to push forward private industry over government inefficiency or he will just flat out ignore it and let someone else handle it however again until the election is over and he actually finds time to look at the whole picture we just will not know in my opinion even ignoring it is many times better than what bush did when he announced moon mars beyond which was a thinly veiled attempt at keeping florida from being captured by his opponent when a politician announces some grand space plan during a election campaign chances are it is going to suck or fail
spacex,not_removed,the first stage is very very far from going fast enough to make a full orbit i dont have the full numbers but its probably around away from orbit i suppose i could check a webcast for some more info but i dont know if thats orbital speed or horizontal vertical speed
spacex,not_removed,rocket trajectory doesnt work like that unfortunately to perform one full revolution around the earth is to perform an orbit right after meco is in suborbital trajectory if left untouched itll reenter the atmosphere in less than an hour
spacex,not_removed,the stage is in a ballistic trajectory meaning its going to hit the earth not orbit it
spacex,not_removed,argh you made me google quantum mechanics questions my theoretical brain hurts in two places at once now in all seriousness if the delft loophole free bell test isnt considered conclusive evidence of ftl communication and i both cant understand why it would or wouldnt be simultaneously then why bother testing quantam entanglement on mars at all to see if gravity impacts quantum states to better understand quantum computing or atmosphere that shouldnt matter right
spacex,not_removed,what could you resolve with a vlbi telescope array lightminutes across i cant even
spacex,not_removed,it could be a place where some of the rules concerning biohazards or genetic engineering or radioactive waste are different which allows experiments that wouldnt be legal on earth this is actually a really good point and represents one area where mars might actually have a competitive advantage
spacex,not_removed,iirc they were planning on the mct reveal much earlier but pushed it back due to the crs explosion would be very bad pr juxaposition to reveal mct with a recent failure and not many wins on the board now for pr they have reusability successes to ride alongside and mct reveal elon has also stated it was a good thing they didnt announce it earlier as theyve learned a lot from the falcon launches that have factored into the mct design
spacex,not_removed,if there will be a crowdfunding with contributors names carved into martian concrete you can count on me
spacex,not_removed,there shouldnt really be a gap in september thats when they plan on reflying the first used booster
spacex,not_removed,hey hey heygwynne would never mislead us if she said there will be launches this year there will be launches this year thats launches you can count on probably sorryi think im going into launch deprivation dts maybe they could just put me in a medically induced coma until the
spacex,not_removed,both the aa and campaign thread are now stickied
spacex,not_removed,i imagined one side booster spending a tiny bit more fuel to send it on a higher boostback arc safely separating them for the rest of their trip back one booster landing well before the other that or using the atmospheric steering capabilities to do something similar
spacex,not_removed,meh you just created a secondary account to sometimes disprove yourself so we dont unveil that you are elon
spacex,not_removed,yes a dramatized fictive documentary series looks promising
spacex,not_removed,it is possible to be a private subsidiary of a public company for example i work for a small private software company that is now owned by panasonic the only difference now that we are owned by a public company is we have to have a few board members from panasonic we have to have budgets and have to publicly declare our earnings so panasonic can meet its obligations as a public company there are special rules in place regarding how many board members panasonic gets how many board votes you need in order to pass something and other rules designed to prevent panasonic from inadvertently damaging our business through poor management panasonic has little experience with commercial business software so technically it is possible for tesla to own a majority stake in spacex and for spacex to become a subsidiary of tesla while still remaining a private company and still maintaining control of the trajectory of the business all that being said im not sure what benefit they would get from doing this so i dont think it will happen
spacex,not_removed,im out of the loop on this why is there launch limit
spacex,not_removed,why inclination over populated area
spacex,not_removed,i dont doubt that they would continue to keep iss launches at the cape it makes sense for multiple reasons not just trajectory however i would think that boca chica could certainly accommodate an iss launch from a southerly azimuth towards the yucatan which is over km away and far enough away to not affected by any firststage hazard area has there been any official word on what azimuths are allowed from boca chica
spacex,not_removed,ive found that the numerous mctbfr speculation posts are okay to ignore but posts like are interesting informative and helpfully a but rare pinging utheblacktom because this is also a response to his post
spacex,not_removed,this is correct top let menu change view goes to space fixed
spacex,not_removed,i knew the conference vid was posted but never saw the onboard version longer than anywhere thought a lot of ppl had missed it like me
spacex,not_removed,unfortunately no were headed west and i decided to spend all seconds staring at it and squealing at my poor girlfriend who thankfully is the current driver
spacex,not_removed,the second booster recently spotted in hawthorne was a fh center core a center core test article not likely to ever be flown
spacex,not_removed,i read that but with kennedy being closed at the time of the launch im not sure where i can watch it from
spacex,not_removed,falcon sounds badass but i guess itd be confusing due to the imminent falcon launch falcon deluxe
spacex,not_removed,all in all im not sure what is more efficient given the staging order and mass configuration theres an ideal throttle setting profile for the side cores and the center core that maximizes upmass guessing what the ideal ascent profile is not trivial but we can make a few educated guesses one of the extreme settings is all cores go to during liftoff and separate at a common meco this is wasteful as a lot of thrust is used on low altitudes where the is about less efficient than at higher km altitudes its also wasteful because the dry mass of the side boosters their structural dry mass plus rtls fuel reserve is carried to a higher altitude and velocity increasing their rtls requirements and reducing the energy spent on accelerating the real payload another extreme setting is to only fire the side boosters and ignite the center core after the side cores have separated this is wasteful because even with the thrust upgrade the falcon heavy is getting the liftoff twr is very close to so the time of ascent is increased a lot which means ms gravity losses every seconds the most optimal setting is somewhere inbetween side cores at throttle a few seconds after liftoff but the center core helps out too to not let twr drop too much during the initial phase while observing maxdrag and payloadintegrity acceleration limits
spacex,not_removed,of course not feel free to add me thanks for showing me the overview id be exited to meet the more prominent members of our subreddit maybe ill dare to drop uechologic a message before the congress
spacex,not_removed,interesting thanks for the info i guess bo really isnt the best nickname huh oh well ill just start calling them blue instead
spacex,not_removed,the lava tubes might be even easier than that one you linked assuming that we can find good candidates that one looks more like a big crater than i dont think you even need the dome just a plug in any ceiling holes and add some airtight barriers up and down the tube since the tubes run horizontally sometimes for long distances and since mars gravity is lower so lava tubes are likely to be much bigger than what we have on earth finding good tubes to live in is probably the best option for easy habitation that could support fairly large communities i mean just imagine one of these but some multiple bigger httpswwwgooglecomsearchqlavatubetbmisch
spacex,not_removed,another mortality issues is what to do with the dead bodies transporting the bodies back to earth would be a waste of fuel and return mass and just burying them outside wastes all those lovely organic molecules and microbes in the body would we see them ceremonially added to a compost heap or rendered down in to useable component parts
spacex,not_removed,one fine day wilst cruising the indian ocean i got hit with a similatr event i was on the of the ship an was playing wargames and did a kill run on the ship i watched it come in feet above the water all the way in from the horizon and it did a last minute pull out while supersonic the geometry of the side made for a massive double boom it felt like getting hit with a pound marshmallow
spacex,not_removed,also the turbo pump will probably go way above the rpms its designed for because instead of having the resistance of pushing fluids it is now just pushing air meaning it over rev
spacex,not_removed,httpwwwgrcnasagovwwwfuelsandspacepropellantsgelledhtm metalising the gel gives an even bigger performance boost but thats another level of complexity if i wanted a really high performance upper stage id use boron or berylliumdoped solid hydrogen in a hybrid rocket
spacex,not_removed,if you fly up as high as possible and then light the falcon does it become space antonov
spacex,not_removed,is feet with interstage i dont remember how long the interstage is exactly but i doubt it is or longer so no wouldnt fit in with or without interstage in theory it could carry the on top like it did with buran and it doesnt have enough lift capacity to lift a fully fueled stage not that it ever would need to anyway of course
spacex,not_removed,right now its mostly the launchpad and related infrastructure and not production capacity thats blocking them they have a backlog for a while of rockets that theyre ready to launch but cant for various reasons because the pad is busy unfavorable weather because the range is performing upgrades because of nesting season for an endangered species because a customer had a shipping or finalpreparation delay on a payload that was ready for quite a while because the pad and hangars are currently configured for another launch and they dont have the infrastructure to let another one jump the queue etc thats why im so excited for to start launching and boca chica after that
spacex,not_removed,not a fan of relying heavily on the custom css links at the top as none of that works when using mobile whats wrong with just using stickies like every other subreddit
spacex,not_removed,yep sticky the ask and upcoming launch campaign threads please would be much more practical on mobile i prefer stickies at all times dont see what is the problem with those
spacex,not_removed,chiming in against the lack of stickies the custom css link doesnt work with res to show how many new comments have been added since the last time you visited the page this is incredibly useful when youre checking the link multiple times a day looking for new questions
spacex,not_removed,i didnt even realize there was a july ask thread since i never saw the sticky i thought you guys just totally forgot to make the thread in the first place i see no downside to having stickies i would recommend to reinstate them
spacex,not_removed,of course i did again the calculation and found slightly differents results but still too high imo i am not taking into account drag during the hoverslam landing burn second anyway so it shouldnt be much and isp variation from throttling first i tried to modelize and expendable ft with thrust upgrade i used specs from however those werent enough to reach spacex sites figures even after reducing the delta v to orbit from lower gravity losses i fine tuned theses values using the specific fuel consumption i used for the first stage a specific impulse of and thrust of kn sea level kn vacuum kn of the difference between the two since the first stage still spend a lot of time in nearvacuum for the first stage and and kn for the second stage spc should be nearly the same for the standard ft i then used the burn times on spacexs s and site to deduce the fuel mass i also assumed it was at full thrust since ses and jcsat second stages burns were longer at and s i then took into account the fairing which weights according to and are near the weight of other fairing of the same size eg ariane at mt kg and are separated s after stage separation on these flights dry mass kg gross mass kg fuel mass kg isp s at stage sep w fairing dry mass kg w fairing gross mass kg wo fairing gross mass kg wo fairing dry mass kg fuel mass kg isp s i get ms with a t payload so ms to go in orbit minus the ms from the lessers gravity losses and ms with a t payload on a trajectory i will now work on landing it is the easiest since it burnt to depletion both on the second stage and the first though unintentionally ses went to a gto orbit so we add about ms to the required dv ms i made a spreadsheet and found that you need kg of fuel remaining in the first stage to have the second stage depleted at this orbit then i calculated the fuel needed for landing burn according to the jcsat youtube video the first stage burned for about s but in this one we can assume that it burned s less and crashed it was still burning a away from the pad using the same specific fuel consumption but throttled down to i get kg of fuel for the landing then i use the rocket equation with isp the boostback burn is in near vacuum gross mass dry and landing mass dry and i get ms of dv now i find it weird because it is enough to kill all velocity at meco blue origins new shepard can survive a free fall from km at meco is at km in this flight an has only minimal damage from one of bezoz tweets it cost only in the lowten of thousands of usd to refurbish it as for i did the same it is a orbit but i tried still uncertain to take into account the seconds difference in the second stage burn at thrust and the seconds of remaining fuel after landing and i found ms slightly lower but still enough to kill all horizontal velocity on this flight i thought it was maybe to limit the g forces from a direct reentry new shepard undergoes at max comparable to a engine hoverslam i also thought it may be to simulate a mars edl but spacexs site shows that the limit to gto with a reusability is t what we are seeing now for launches in years heck it is two times the realistic estimation of a mars edl i am puzzled any answer editmore sources
spacex,not_removed,against those benefits more engines more complexity more points of failure greater likelihood of failure but spx design with this in mind so the chance of failure is offset by the engineout capacity for example
spacex,not_removed,it fits in with the fact that almost all large engines are within the thrust range per chamber there have only been two larger than that the and the and only one of those flew even the which is still the most powerful liquid engine ever built used multiple smaller chambers connected to a single set of turbomachinery because it reduced the problem of thrust instabilities in the case of the it took something like years and more than test firings to solve the instability problems and nobody wants to deal with that these days
spacex,not_removed,the us governmentnasa needs to do this sort of bid build buy competition as demonstrated by darpa far more often what they are spending on sls is a crime when private industry could and would do the job for far less nasa does some things so well in the areas of deep space exploration and research on the human medical condition in space let them do what they do best and let private industry provide them the tools at a savings to the american taxpayer
spacex,not_removed,i love the idea of a bunch of astronauts excitedly waiting at the door for treats i hope they put some in for the russians too how sad would that be
spacex,not_removed,httpstwittercomtungstenflight dragon hatch is open thanks for all the supplies spacex congrats to all the teams nasajohnson this message was created by a bot
spacex,not_removed,to elaborate on comment based on the recode interview i would think that spacex needs to launch the bfr in in order to have people on the launch as elon hopes there is no way that the first launch will have people on it i think elon may have said that the mct will launch in in that same recode interview as well but id have to doublecheck i may be misremembering
spacex,not_removed,redundant computers that use voting or lockstep arrangements that rerun calculations in the event of an error have been around in aircraft and mainframes for decades id be very surprised if they were doing anything fundamentally different from existing concepts particularly given how little computing power dragon requires and how short its operating lifespan is compared to enterprise grade systems
spacex,not_removed,and on top of that theres any number of fill lines drain lines vent lines hydraulic lines pneumatic lines and signal pyro or power cables those almost always get left off the diagram i once ran across a detailed exposition of an engine that diagrammed all the pipes including the minor ones have to see if i can find it again
spacex,not_removed,do they tend to use one or the other for crs missions they mostly seem to look like the extended version
spacex,not_removed,cool infographics one small observation in the mars edl step you write in a hoverslam the engines are throttled all the way up and kept at full throttle until touchdown i think its pretty unlikely that they will be using throttle all the way to touchdown for a couple of reasons the reason is that the seasonal atmospheric layering of mars is still very much an unknown its hard even on earth and requires regular weather balloon probes so the precise conditions of the descent cannot be calculated in advance furthermore superdraco engines use pressure hypergolics which have the big advantage of allowing very fine tuned throttling without loss of efficiency so they can do a very precise landing sequence the dragon can hover as well mars gravity is only of earths so gravity losses are only about a third of that of a landing on earth minimizing them is important but being able to land robustly is more important the other unknown factor is the exact layout of the landing site while orbiters will be imaging their resolution is still in the range and you wouldnt want to land on a rock that your orbital images have not managed to resolve so id expect the red dragon to use some sort of automated object imaging method radar lidar optical cameras or a combination of them to precisely position the red dragon on its final landing site the final uncertainty is that the lander might miss its intended landing circle entirely and would have to land wherever it ends up and it might not have any preprogrammed notion of where its going to land having a semiintelligent landing software able to land without knowing anything about the landing site is thus important all in one a hoverslam with superdracos throttled all the way up to requires perfect knowledge and that is not present on mars robust landing on mars requires a healthy δv reserve and the final landing has to be much softer than a hoverslam id expect of the final δv to be killed via a burn but the remaining killed in a much softer fashion with a very soft final touchdown on the surface of mars as long as residual fuel margins permit
spacex,not_removed,it will have more propellant than the standard dragon some have speculated that it will have more propellant than the standard dragon we have no confirmation either way if theyll add more prop tanks
spacex,not_removed,this is all i got so far thinking about reaching to them again dropping another thread and maybe see if the sub can do something mods were surprisingly quiet about this cc uforgotdamnpassword
spacex,not_removed,also no engines fitted which makes it a tankairframe test article since the engines are not stressed members they could fit engines at mcgregor but i dont think we have seen any previous examples of this very unlikely to fly a structural test article as you typically test these up to yield limits so there is a finite chance of structural damage that could show up in flight
spacex,not_removed,any thoughts how that will work booster booster or something like and its something we will need to work out soon so we can start adding the cores to the wiki as they roll out also on a tangent should the core we observed outside hawthorne be added to the cores page on the wiki was it ever settled if it was a test article or a production core
spacex,not_removed,thank you that seems right i guess the extra drive wouldnt matter to them bummer i wanted to see one drive through my city
spacex,not_removed,this is so sad you can feel this in the videos they show the russian guys always just do some stuff far in the background they arent introduced etc
spacex,not_removed,except it does look like its hovering or at least it has almost velocity far above the asds its certainly not performing a normal hoverslam where it should get to hover very close to above the asds then cut power slam
spacex,not_removed,thanks while i was hoping for more of an endtoend look where we could see the flip and boostback i think uquadrplax is right that they wont release it since there wouldnt be much to see in the dark im looking forward to the day we can see one of those videos from a daytime launch the onboard camera video from thaicom is possibly my favorite spacex vid to date just because of the sweeping view of the earth and how well it conveys the change in orientation of the rocket from launch to apex to landing
spacex,not_removed,at shown by the clock display in the upper right corner in the technical landing video an expanding ring of something sweeps across the landing pad at it appears that the main body of the rocket exhaust hits the surface of the landing pad is it possible that the expanding ring at is made up of dust and dirt that had accumulated on the landing pad and is being blown away as though it had been hit by a huge leaf blower if so it may indicate that spacex didnt thoroughly clean the pad before landing which may mean that theyre not very concerned about very small pieces of debris hitting the booster or maybe they figure the booster will do the cleaning for them
spacex,not_removed,well maybe current eta is lateearly though i do agree it will probably launch from ksc
spacex,not_removed,id be great to have one of the first fh side boosters in a museum but if it ruds think of how many museums could get a piece
spacex,not_removed,that implies that the event only affects earth for instance when the sun expands im pretty sure it is going to take mars with it as well so i dont think there is such a thing as being safe just safer the more diverse we get the safer we get
spacex,not_removed,elon talked about that usb cable issue at tesla in an interview at kahn academy its right at the beginning
spacex,not_removed,awesome thanks do you know of any list with all that information from all the launches ps upvpplayerpro says on the other comment that is capsule not which is true
spacex,not_removed,source on it being capsule
spacex,not_removed,interesting that actually sells diving rebreathers and scrubber supplies online for technical reference only i assume that these items are only intended for highly trained users
spacex,not_removed,dragon is the only vehicle that can power a freezer or several freezers others like cygnus could transport them empty and switched off which means ice cream would not survive as ice cream there were a lot of freezers in the iss as they stacked up with samples since the shuttle was decomissioned dragon brought them down gradually i have no idea if the backlog is cleared by now
spacex,not_removed,given the expense of spacegrade freezers though id presume that only dragons pressurized downmass can carry ice cream my guess is that one of the reasons why the dragon can carry ice cream is because it is sending up empty freezers so it can take samples from science experiments down but if you are sending a freezer up and are volume not mass constrained anyway why not put some ice cream into it to enhance the work performance of the iss crew winwin
spacex,not_removed,i learn so much just reading this stuff now if i could just keep of it stuck to the grey matter
spacex,not_removed,have you thought about how the nozzles of some solid rocket motors can be gimballed and how they arent liquid cooled food for thought hint think knights in plated armor
spacex,not_removed,just as an example the engines on an blackbird have an exhaust temperature of c at full afterburner the combustion temperature of keroseneoxygen rockets and therefore close to the exhaust temperature at the nozzle is about c its ludicrously hot and very hard to build moving parts into
spacex,not_removed,at least some jupiter missions can now be done using solar cells for example juno which recently arrived in jupiter orbit rtgs are still the power supply of choice for high performance landers production of plutonium has with a test batch of produced so far include kg produced in so the plan is to have more available than the current stockpile but it will be years before there is significant production volume
spacex,not_removed,they have reopened a production line more rtg are coming not many but able to support some missions
spacex,not_removed,thats gonna be one of the four mentioned in httpwwwnasagovpressreleasenasaorderssecondspacexcrewmissiontointernationalspacestation article spacex is building four crew dragon spacecraft at its hawthorne facility two for qualification testing and two for flight tests next year
spacex,not_removed,jupiter has moons saturn has
spacex,not_removed,thanks but one question where is the source of this i mean from the engines being original i havent seen anything about that i am not saying anything about you being wrong but i wonder where that info comes from
spacex,not_removed,this is the correct answer planes go down because a bird gets sucked into the engine and disables them not because of structural damage due to the impact
spacex,not_removed,it makes sense to me atleast what they are asking is that assuming mct can send to mars then how much can it send to other destinations such as titan callisto or europa though he doesnt specify if thats to orbit or landing i could probably work it out buts its too early for maths
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,between the first pics and last the scales are the same thanks for pointing that out yes this is just simulation based on assumptions of booster events it can give you bigger picture but not perfect match to every single detail flightclub author uthevehicledestroyer mentioned in this that he went back in each time after launch to update default parameters and match real booster events as much as possible pretty awesome job
spacex,not_removed,i havent really been paying much attention to flighclub since it came out do you know what kind of integration technique it uses verlet runge kutta adams bashforth euler how does it account for different drag coefficients and thrust during the different speedsdifferent mission profiles and phases of the flight fairing v dragon ascent v descent different angles of attact altitude ect
spacex,not_removed,i was under the impression that it was most efficient to launch directly to mars or any other planet without orbiting earth first the lower you are in the gravity well and the faster you are going doing soincreases your efficiency arguably more challenging given you need to launch instantaneously so that you are burning at the correct angle in relation to the sun you still want to do as much of it horizontally as possible to avoid gravity loss which will probably translate to an expendable if not will need a lot of modification for the mars burn to happen after orbiting
spacex,not_removed,thanks a lot this list should have a lot of info ill have a read
spacex,not_removed,thats what im talkin about this list rocks d i might collect mct posts
spacex,not_removed,i think you should just add this list directly to the wiki and maintain it there
spacex,not_removed,i didnt even know this existed thanks for linking it
spacex,not_removed,congress would have to cancel sls and i dont see that happening its not called the senate launch system for nothing
spacex,not_removed,actually is about from an orbital velocity of at meco
spacex,not_removed,i would join you in the coma except that i only want to be women periodically every five months and once for the mars technology presentation in september i also want to be awake for the first falcon heavy launch in late edit women should of course be woken damn you swipe keyboard
spacex,not_removed,thanks a lot for that i really missed the stickies
spacex,not_removed,if theyre flying close but staggered theres still a risk of the first side booster ruding and being a hazard for the other my main hope is that it can be captured with a wide angle lens need a new wallpaper
spacex,not_removed,thats the whole point though as soon as you have to start answering to beancounters then you jeopardise your ability to actually get to mars the whole reason for staying private is so that you can avoid the destructive external pressure to generate profits
spacex,not_removed,why is there a launch limit mostly because that is what spacex stated they wanted to do when they did their environmental impact study to raise the limit spacex would have to do another environmental impact study to demonstrate that the local environmental impact is low enough even with the additional launches and then have it reviewed and approved by the epa they would also have to renegotiate the noise pollution limit exceptions they got from the brownsville local government etc
spacex,not_removed,yup they could dogleg if they needed to but why even bother
spacex,not_removed,florida yucatan and cuba allow only two narrow launch lanes
spacex,not_removed,well good eyes and nice spotting better safe than sorry
spacex,not_removed,added i imagine they will encourage a meetupthing anyway the best outcome could be a group photo in front of a spacex booth or with elon himself
spacex,not_removed,blue sounds good its a shame the initials spell bo since blue origin is otherwise a pretty cool name reminds me of carl sagan talking about the pale blue dot not really a fan of the latin slogan though kinda sounds like theyre trying too hard to sound profound just my two cents and ill admit that if spacex used a latin slogan id almost certainly find some way of convincing myself that in the case of spacex its totally appropriate
spacex,not_removed,if i wanted a really high performance upper stage id use boron or berylliumdoped solid hydrogen in a hybrid rocket or red oxygen 😎
spacex,not_removed,it likely would become a very very fast antonov but very very briefly before it evolved into its final form of disintegrating antonov
spacex,not_removed,i got all my numbers from i thought that was the most accurate open source
spacex,not_removed,i am so ready for a launch
spacex,not_removed,new shepherd is a much lighter booster with a relatively low aspect ratio and a large airbrake section at the top so its terminal velocity is likely one third that of the the other point of difference is that peaks above in altitude while new shepherd is at it may not seem like much but the extra fall while well above the atmosphere adds significantly to the velocity at atmospheric entry having said all that there is no real evidence of damage for the rtls flight just the much higher reentry velocity gto flights
spacex,not_removed,from what i can tell your math makes sense but i am by no means an expert your results are definitely not intuitive hopefully someone more knowledgeable than i am can provide some insight edit definitely corrected
spacex,not_removed,at stage sep w fairing dry mass kg w fairing gross mass kg wo fairing gross mass kg i am actually struggling to reconcile your mass figures and perhaps there is some mistake that has affected the rest of your calculations the stretched has tonnes mass fully fueled with no fairings or payload the fairings are thought to be tonnes per half so tonnes total are you adding aero losses and gravity losses to the meco velocity to get the total delta v expended by and therefore the remaining propellant mass it appears to be lower than you are assuming
spacex,not_removed,as umartianspirit pointed out theres got to be some optimum size for thrustweight ratio having engines larger and fewer or smaller and more numerous will both increase the total engine mass im curious why multiple identical engines increases complexity theyre just copies of eachother so they dont add much information to the system right as long as theyre independent the designer can reason about copies as easily as a single copy or is that not what you mean by complexity it seems like while there are indeed more parts the failure probability can be reasoned about using simple statistics and managed with redundancy like you mentioned but im often wrong and would love to be set straight thanks for your post
spacex,not_removed,yeah tough thing though if nasa spends less money they dont lower taxes they put that money into something else the senate launch system is a matter of we were given this much money we have to spend it and it obviously makes some kind of sense for some senators to get that money spent inefficiently in their state if you said well using private launchers could get you more sciencebang for your buck they would ask what state the money is going to these things you have to as i say tom sawyer it figure out their motive make them want to whitewash the fence for you
spacex,not_removed,if you do find it id love to see it too
spacex,not_removed,as far as i know the extended trunk has never flown maybe someone else can confirm this the diagram is a bit misleading because i agree if you look at it and actual photographs it seems as if it was the extended trunk that flew but if you look in the diagram below the solar panels then the trunk would be extended below it thats not what we see in photographs of the actual dragon
spacex,not_removed,yeah i know they wont use throttle but i wanted to keep it as simple as possible i suspect theyll perform a hoverslam to a meter or two in altitude then descend slowly from there the margins will be tight but their sensors are accurate the falcon uses a radar altimeter and the dragon probably will too
spacex,not_removed,ah nice one fella i had all the money thank you brexit bet but i couldnt get the time off work id like to think that the spacex pr team would want a video of the conference
spacex,not_removed,i dont think we have seen any previous examples of this interesting it thought engines were always added at mcgregor anyone knows a good resource on the complete manufacturing process of a rocket where and when certain parts of a are assembled
spacex,not_removed,you may just see one they change the routes up regularly for security reasons
spacex,not_removed,it is sad but its also a point of happiness that were still with russia on iss despite everythingfor now
spacex,not_removed,it looks similar to dust blown up by bo landings check out the flickr for better pictures of the dust
spacex,not_removed,mars doesnt wait launch window for is aprilmay no more no less
spacex,not_removed,sure but thats not spacexs purpose
spacex,not_removed,then it should be an earth sized astronomical extinction level event safe status
spacex,not_removed,i cant see there being any reason for a vertical component gravity will take care of nullifying that maybe its just an oversight on the part of the artist what drawings have you seen that show this
spacex,not_removed,the trick isnope no trick well i guess the trick is to just remember how equations interact not the equations themselves
spacex,not_removed,have you thought about how the nozzles of some solid rocket motors can be gimballed and how they arent liquid cooled two counter arguments firstly i think thats at least partly an apples to oranges comparison solidfuel rockets have much lower chamber pressures and lower efficiency because the whole rocket is one huge pressure chamber the space shuttle srbs for example had maximum chamber pressures levels of around bar which was about a third of the pressure levels of the main engine combustion chambers bar secondly i think its significantly less complex to move the whole nozzle than to extend its contour along a very precise profile the former can be done via a ball joint kind of mechanism that does not change the dimensions of the nozzle the second is much more difficult because new matter has to slide in where there was only free space before and in an expanding diameter
spacex,not_removed,its ludicrously hot and very hard to build moving parts into not just hot the combustion chamber pressure levels are ridiculous as well in excess of bar high temperature high mass flow ie high heat flux and high pressure necessitates actively cooled combustion chamber and nozzle which makes any sort of moving part ridiculously hard to implement the whole combustion chamber nozzle can be moved as a single block to implement thrust vectoring but thats about it note that the raptor methalox engine will have much better sl thrust the sea level penalty is a lot lower for methalox full flow staged combustion than for the open cycle merlin btw i believe the center engine on the falcon probably has a free nozzle extender the exhaust of all the other engines which create a kind of aerospike effect this effect will be even more prominent on the bfr engines will be outer engines with about aerospike effect engines will be inner engines with a full aerospike effect i believe ie spacex will improve sl thrust very significantly by going to sc methalox and by using even more engines without having to use variable contour nozzles or an explicit aerospike design
spacex,not_removed,yep they actually havent had a full dragon test articlethe one they had was built on a dragon pressure hull
spacex,not_removed,i hope the falcon heavy can launch a spacecraft to europa
spacex,not_removed,someone who worked on it
spacex,not_removed,also depends on the energy of orbit injection value is important and how optimum of a window is present
spacex,not_removed,if the payload mass can be used for some more fuel without using any funny trajectory i suspect that the answer is a few tons and probably in the same ballpark for all three mentioned bodies if he meant to the surface of i imagine one could get captured by and land on titan directly with some very very tolerant payload and a whole lot of heatshield if it does not end in expensive fireworks it could bring titan closer than europa or callisto the mct probably will not do that if you find the courage to do the math thanks in advance im interested in a real answer as well
spacex,not_removed,author here answer to the first question is the leapfrog integrator throttle profiles are defined by the user but thrust changes with atmospheric density so the concepts of sea level vs vacuum thrustisp exist i created a curve for drag coefficient for ascent roughly modeling a bullet and using a saturn v simulation for how the coefficient changes in transonicsupersonic and another for descent modeling a flat faced cylinder drag coming down only really matters between entry and landing burns since the retro burns tend to negate drag entirely fairing just increase the cross sectional area but assume the same coefficient profile atmospheric density changes with altitude as per the standard atmosphere
spacex,not_removed,i was under the impression that it was most efficient to launch directly to mars or any other planet without orbiting earth first yes thats the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiobertheffect the lower you are in the gravity well and the faster you are going doing soincreases your efficiency arguably more challenging given you need to launch instantaneously so that you are burning at the correct angle in relation to the sun you still want to do as much of it horizontally as possible to avoid gravity loss that depends on the thrusttoweightratio of your propulsion system if your propulsion is high efficiency but low thrust such as an ion engine then it will be more efficient to go into parking orbit and do a series of perigee kicks to build up orbital velocity and then do a final mars injection burn if you have a high enough twr then you can do a single tmi burn like the nasa maven orbiter did im not aware of any mars mission that did a single launch burn without first coasting in a leo parking orbit it would be pretty challenging as to have a maximum efficiency launch towards mars you want your momentary orbital velocity vector to point straight towards mars which restricts the optimal launch window to a couple of seconds and theres the uncertainty of going through a variable density variable temperature and variable wind speed layers of atmosphere more launch flexibility can be achieved by first reaching a low parking orbit and then coasting a bit until reaching the perfect point to do the tmi burn theres no extra energy cost in stopping the burn to mars once orbital velocity has been achieved you can still use the oberth effect in leo parking orbit its much easier to perfectly time a separate upper stage tmi burn than to time a single continuous launch sequence through the atmosphere
spacex,not_removed,related but i think this is an interesting read
spacex,not_removed,thats cool we dont judge here whatever floats your boat
spacex,not_removed,ah makes sense thank you
spacex,not_removed,this doesnt look like an official ruling at all rather someones study on the site
spacex,not_removed,they are really narrow so for what type of launches they can be used geo mars
spacex,not_removed,i agree that my analogy may not be the best though if we deduce new shepards dry mass from the throttled down thrust kn according to and we know from the video that it can hover is surprisingly high compared to the t of the with the figures i found could negate all velocity at meco including vertical velocity so the apogee wouldnt be much higher than at separation maybe km however i am less certain of my result as ive rewatched and jcsat launches i noticed that the reentry burns were seconds and seconds respectively were they throttling down for to limit gforces which translate using the same specific fuel comsumption and number as my first calculation and assuming max thrust as ms of dv for the reentry burn for and ms for also they were determined from the voice over on the videos seconds long on crs s on thaicom seconds for eutelsatabs seconds i am not sure for jason this led me to believe that spacex are continually experimenting the landing i will try to do the math again in another way but the payload reduction from kg to kg for gto launches is really puzzling
spacex,not_removed,well assembly is more complex instead of x components cables pipes sensors valves etc you install an order of magnitude more i also think a fair number of the components are not identical because you have to track everything individually a cable needs to be connected to one specific point and not any of possible points assembly instructions are longer inspection instructions are longer edit so i think most components are very similar but not identicalinterchangeable it makes it more confusing and pokayoke solutions harder to implement
spacex,not_removed,i suspect theyll perform a hoverslam to a meter or two in altitude then descend slowly from there thats very risky because if you arrive to that point with any excess velocity you dont have the throttle range to correct youll smash into mars and lose the vehicle its better to kill most of you velocity while still in safe altitude then throttle back and work from a throttle range this gives throttleup room to correct in both directions to significantly change the trajectory and only about msec lost to gravity every second that should give enough margin to throttle back once within a few meters and touch down softly with a total δv budget of ms that should be plenty good you dont want to maximize efficiency above all you want to maximize the chances of landing
spacex,not_removed,most likely it will be recorded as you can see previous events on the iaf youtube channel however we might need to lobby for a livestream they might just go with streaming our event for free means less ticket sales which might be true however im not sure about that i imagine they will be sold out
spacex,not_removed,from an interview but its also mentioned in many other articles httpwwwgqcomstoryelonmuskmarsspacexteslainterview by chris heath december on the two reasons that sending humans to mars is imperative the first being that it is inspirational the other is the long­term survival of humankind if a calamity self­made or otherwise destroyed life on earth as long as a human colony was established elsewhere the species could endure the article goes on to quote elon as saying you back up your hard drive maybe we should back up life too a very long and interesting interview while elons focus is on establishing a selfsufficient mars colony there may be benefits to having other nonmars nonearth solar system resources as well for example it may turn out in the long run that some materials needed on mars could be more inexpensively obtained elsewhere maybe platinum for example in which case the prospects for human survival would be enhance by having access to these resources as well but certainly setting up a fully selfsufficient human colony on mars would be an excellent approach to occupying and utilizing the solar system
spacex,not_removed,the one they had was built on a dragon pressure hull huh i didnt know that thanks
spacex,not_removed,europa pls
spacex,not_removed,it is indeed however land overflight rules are wellknown and their application quite predictable as cuba is unlikely to move any time soon
spacex,not_removed,yes thats about it plane change for leo is too expensive for boca chica to hit any but those two a few degrees you could maybe put a space station at one of those inclinations and be able to get to it from texas and florida thats kind of what they did with the iss except the restriction was the crazy high latitude of baikonur
spacex,not_removed,i really liked graphic showing the relative size of the two boosters the aerodynamic area is very similar and the mass of the new shepherd is as you say around tonnes during landing so the terminal velocity will be a little over half the value for i think you may be confusing elons expected reusability overheads of for asds and for rtls for leo missions with the much higher penalty of for asds landing on gto missions as revealed by the spacex website the reason for the disparity is very simple for gto missions the trajectory is much and faster at meco so that rtls is impossible and there is barely sufficient propellant left to brake down to around for reentry and then a landing burn of around
spacex,not_removed,this is pretty much it even with identical engines youve still got plenty of plumbing in the same way as the space shuttle is the warning from history about reusability the soviet is the warning about lots and lots and lots of engines
spacex,not_removed,i meant with a hoverslam at a thrust level or so ie hoverslam but calibrated for meters instead of theyll still be reading altitude during the hoverslam itself dragon and red dragon as far as we know only has about of dv they can probably squeeze a lot more out by lightening the capsule
spacex,not_removed,i can see why that would be the case for asds landings the boostback starts after apogee hence the retrograde vector is above the horizon and the best reduction in overall velocity which effects downrange distance is given by thrusting toward retrograde for rtls i cannot contribute the only thing that might be relevant is that there is an angle away from proretrograde in a noncircular orbit where velocity is increaseddecreased but the apogee remains the same they may be using this to achieve the failure mode landing burn fails to start stage crashes into the ocean maybe theres a range of angles that the stage is able to approach at before starting the landing burn and controlling the vertical speed and apogee is how they achieve that ie coming straight down or gliding a bit a few degrees of tilt sorry i couldnt be more quantitative about it
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,even at that distance away land overflight rules would come into play
spacex,not_removed,the soviet is the warning about lots and lots and lots of engines yeah but they didnt build test stands and tested the engines by building rockets on them ing insane according to a documentary i watched
spacex,not_removed,dragon and red dragon as far as we know only has about of dv its probably significantly more than the ms available for powered landings on earth the recent structural load testing pictures suggest a significantly beefed up fuel tank section mars atmosphere is near vacuum so isp could be higher mars gravity is much lower so gravity losses should be lower as well and as you suggest probably a fair amount of mass could be shed from the red dragon and came to msec
spacex,not_removed,i meant with a hoverslam at a thrust level or so ie hoverslam but calibrated for meters instead of theyll still be reading altitude during the hoverslam itself yeah maybe but still it feels way too risky for a first attempt i expect them to travel with a light payload leaving plenty of δv for a safe landing approach similar to what they did with the falcon the first rtls landing was a approach in its entirety they only started experimenting with highthrust landing methods once they nailed the landing approach
spacex,not_removed,yes in fact for dragon flights to the iss spacex has at least once had to get a i havent checked but they probably have to do that for every crs flight
spacex,not_removed,yeah but they didnt build test stands and tested the engines by building rockets on them not quite the engines where not refireable so they picked one random engine out of every batch manufactured and tested it and if it passed the batch was assumed good not unlike how spacex tested struts prior to so while the individual engines on the final rocket wasnt tested the design and manufacturing certainly was what really killed the was the inability to model how the vibrations from engines interacted forcing the russian engineers to test that by building a rocket on as you put it but with modern computers that shouldnt be a problem for spacex
spacex,not_removed,thanks thats really interesting i had no idea such waivers would be required

spacex,not_removed,similar thread from years ago
spacex,not_removed,i dont like that the text covers the rocket
spacex,not_removed,more of a framed print on the wall thing for me
spacex,not_removed,tshirt looks cool if you like it go for it out of curiosity is that an actual elon quote and if so do you have the context
spacex,not_removed,i would rather have a shirt with a tiny falcon or dragon capsule on it like the ralph lauren polo player logo something subtle classy yet fun
spacex,not_removed,so i see people sharing their designs heres my idea for spacex engineering achievements tribute
spacex,not_removed,should be two sentences
spacex,not_removed,it would be hard to get that to print well on a tee shirt shirts do better with higher contrast
spacex,not_removed,that is awesome and i would buy one depending on price
spacex,not_removed,no it is not an elon quote its from a show called rick and morty
spacex,not_removed,httpiimgurcomaprgmrwjpg how does this look its a quick mockup but i like the idea might make it into something nice you could do the same thing with the spacex x
spacex,not_removed,after i first heard that song with voices i thought well good choice of music this fits perfectly
spacex,not_removed,wow thats amazing can i use it to print tshirt
spacex,not_removed,why does it say elon musk that looks like an attribution what does mean
spacex,not_removed,ah jeez rick youre crossing the streams here its attributing a quote to someone that didnt say it while also changing the wording from a oneoff but funny comment from a tv show i think youd be better off printing something witty elon musk really did say or just using the original quote from the show possibly attributing to rick maybe if it was a recurring popular catch phrase and musk happened to be known to be a big fan of the show it might work but as it is youre going to just be confusing people who might be left thinking it was something he really said and constantly explaining it to people that might not remember something rick said in one episode of the cartoon if theyve even seen it my two cents mah man
spacex,not_removed,looks like the dragon it would be cool to just have an upright dragon maybe with landing legs out also i wouldnt actually wear a polo if it were a thick longsleeve tshirt or a button up also i wasnt expecting you to actually do work on this
spacex,not_removed,sure heres a hires with alpha channel should be printable with some dense ink on a black tshirt i guess
spacex,not_removed,it is a reference to the show from which the shirt comes from rick and morty in the show there are infinite dimensions each with an identifier the dimension the show follows is therefore this is the elon musk from dimension
spacex,not_removed,hmm interesting ill try a few designs and see what works
spacex,not_removed,thanks man
spacex,not_removed,perhaps you should mention rick and morty in the image ive never heard of the show so it is a bit cryptic
spacex,not_removed,from the press conference elon wants the its booster to be able to fly once every hour
spacex,not_removed,wow the first reuse of a falcon first stage a totally successful mission and landing attempt and now we get another peek at the its awesome all the best for spacex in i cant wait for the next launch
spacex,not_removed,this postlaunch press conference is gold awesome info coming out of it wish we had a videostream of it edit edit it has ended but through the link you can watch the whole conference
spacex,not_removed,is the update related to the carbon fiber tank testing i wonder
spacex,not_removed,elon musk im pretty excited about the updated its strategy since guadalajara it makes a lot more sense for getting this done without going bankrupt the new approach should be able to solve the economic issues hopefully on the website in a month or so this suggest that musk must have identified some plausible commercial markets for its launch services or products i have no idea exactly what but perhaps something like being able to deliver massive highpower leo internet satellites with large solar arrays that can directly communicate with low power devices like cell phones or delivering massive satellites to each geo slot that have transponders for almost every frequency instead of just a few bands musk also recently mentioned for the first time that they think cislunar space tourism could be a significant source of income sorry bo and vg and there will always be nasa although nasa hasnt quite figured out exactly what they need
spacex,not_removed,hopefully another video or some more drawings
spacex,not_removed,perhaps they did away with the big window
spacex,not_removed,i think it might have something to do with the constellation since he mentioned the update would have to do with funding what else could bring enough money to fund the its development
spacex,not_removed,i think that it may be possible that spacex as a whole has decided collectively to split its into a block and block would be for those initial missions that carry people and then block would be the large pax interplanetary colony ship that spacex had envisioned for largescale mars settlement if you think about this idea it makes perfect sense a scaled down block version could be a proof of concept that would allow them to really wow the world and hit the ground running given that block is a success they could then scale up to block and that would enable large scale colonization if you think about this idea there is less initial cost and inherent risk yet still a way to deliver the dream of pax to mars at a time
spacex,not_removed,i just realized that reflying the falcon in a expandable configuration will soon be a thing of the past spacex will be able to fly a falcon heavy for less money by reusing it mind blown
spacex,not_removed,with musks reference to budget and timeline i would guess the next update will be a smaller simpler rocket that wont require government support if the administration doesnt want to fund medical research theres no point in having confidence in selling them on rocket research and waiting or years for a new administration isnt how musk operates
spacex,not_removed,at the press conference musk brought back the terms mars colonial transporter and bfr here is a thought its was purely a rebranding of mct in an attempt to attract serious nasa funding timed for the presidential transition but now musk has concluded that congressional support for sls is not about to go away and nasas budget is not about to double any time soon so spacex will needs to continue paying for mct development and it will cost quite a bit more than the spent to adapt the falcon for reuse initially most of this will come from a much greater profit margin launching reused falcon for slightly less than current prices later some will come from satellite internet revenue and perhaps some will come from leo tourism and lunar flybys

spacex,not_removed,i assume he means able to fly again an hour after landing not one is launching every hour by my calculations the latter would use of the natural gas production of the united states and more lox than is produced in the world
spacex,not_removed,this just keeps getting better and better
spacex,not_removed,that will be astonishingly loud for a long time what are the locals going to think about that
spacex,not_removed,thats gonna be a big methane pipe
spacex,not_removed,and successful fairing recovery perfect day
spacex,not_removed,and possibly the first use of optimus prime
spacex,not_removed,aaaaanf we are done
spacex,not_removed,he also mentioned theyd refined the design and that it also included the propellant production system on mars
spacex,not_removed,perhaps something like being able to deliver massive highpower leo internet satellites with large solar arrays that can directly communicate with low power devices like cell phones that makes no sense really the problem with sat comms has always been the uplink – cell phones powerful enough to communicate with leo need specialized radio hardware and are heavy big and have short battery life
spacex,not_removed,if i had to guess it involves productising the tanker as a tug fuel station basically eating the market ula saw for aces and at the same time building a compelling service that nasa and other space agencies can build missions on top of without giving full control to spacex further speculation the spaceship loses a lot of its tank space and its vacuum engines evolving into a landing launch habitat role with the tanker tug taking over all vacuum propulsion duties this should also help a lot with keeping down the height of the spaceship which makes landing easier as well as the transfer of crew and cargo to the surface
spacex,not_removed,does anybody think it may be commercial intercontinental suborb transport with its
spacex,not_removed,i think they will looking to compete in any market that exists or has potential demand including new modules for iss and leo space hotels
spacex,not_removed,my first guess is it will get a actual vehicle page and navigation link just like heavy and dragon i would also hope more details about the raptor and its progress in testing as well as maybe a status update on what actually happened with the tank and what they are hoping to get done in the next year or so a steady cadence of updates would be nice
spacex,not_removed,i looooove me some technical drawings if they do put out some new renderings im considering having them printed out as posters and putting them up on the walls i could probably look at those things for hours
spacex,not_removed,hopefully not but maybe a redesign to make it a bit more aesthetically appealing p i dunno tesselated triangles arent really my thing hexagons though those are pretty sexy
spacex,not_removed,when i first saw that window i though the video was fanmade and not a real spacex design
spacex,not_removed,perhaps they did away with the big window no way elon musk sees that as an essential part of the architecture but maybe the windows for passenger compartments go
spacex,not_removed,what else could bring enough money to fund the its development what theyve always done to fund development make paying customers pay for the development missions i think theyre shifting from an its in isolation development strategy with all its funding problems to doing what theyre good at with a falcon into its smooth transition strategy so this could be a smaller scale new glenn scale its booster first which will fly on paying missions like does today followed by a reusable upper stage etc to prove the tech it could culminate with a red dragonstyle mission to land the upper stage on mars by which time theyll have proven virtually all of the pieces necessary for its and can hopefully get public funding for the fullscale humanrated vehicle
spacex,not_removed,i actually hope youre right i think starting with a mini its is going to become a necessary concession in order to get flying within a reasonable number of years the current its design is very ambitious im not saying it cant be done but rather that it will take a helluva lot of time and money for rd to bring it to the point where you feel comfortable sending it to mars i fully expect to see a couple of ruds during early testing which on a rocket that size means big expenses and lots of time rebuilding there are so many technologies they need to master which have nothing to do with the size of the rocket methane engines landing inside launch clamps fuel transfer in microgravity full carbon tanks etc considering all of the above the history of the falcon series there will almost certainly be a grasshopperlike testbed several minor redesigns after they become orbit capable and a gradual process of control system refinement over many launches if they stick with the current plan spacexs funding will be too thin for serious its development until years down the track when their satellite constellation is raking in billions
spacex,not_removed,i think its about the constellation since he seemed to be talking about how they were going to be able to fund the project it seemed like he will be ready to announce the source of funding for the project in the next update
spacex,not_removed,you seems to be implying that spacex needs to develop a smaller rocket just because the government doesnt support spacexs current plans spacex never said its required government support its is to be privately funded from the start plus designing a rocket from scratch is extremely expensive due to development costs even for small rockets the size of the rocket is limited by technical feasibility about which elon seemed very confident so if the technical challenges are solved raptor composite tanks heatshield you dont save a massive amount a money by reducing the size of the rocket maybe a bit but you are still in the same ballpark and will not drastically change funding
spacex,not_removed,smaller is not going to happen it is just too expensive to develop separate systems maybe much smaller for cislunar use but that is too small for mars
spacex,not_removed,im a little worried after listening to the audio they made changes to make it cheaper that could mean a lot of things i hope its not scaling down
spacex,not_removed,wasent there going to be a falcon at some point edit wiki says stratolaunch systems hired spacex in to build a vehicle that would have been similar to the purposes falcon they ended there relationship in after space x didnt agree with stratos designs interesting
spacex,not_removed,rud has been mentioned a few times in this thread maybe you should add it to your list rapid unplanned disassembly
spacex,not_removed,what lead time did that math assume because i dont see why a colony ship couldnt hang out in leo for a month before departing for mars in fact id pay extra to be on a ship that hung out in leo for a month before departing for mars i suppose there could be concerns with food supplies and overexposure to microgravity
spacex,not_removed,i would really like to see a payload version
spacex,not_removed,kind of akin to requiring the entire worlds yearly output of lithium to make an electric car at scale just saying dont sell elon short
spacex,not_removed,spacex just needs to build a gigafactory for lng and lox problem solved
spacex,not_removed,the fuel plant that works on mars works on earth too just better
spacex,not_removed,the bigger issue is if they can even fuel something that big that fast
spacex,not_removed,but thats only a difference of what falcon lands at roughly minutes i cant imagine the its booster will land much later than that
spacex,not_removed,that might be the market to tackle by the boring company drilling division
spacex,not_removed,he could produce all his methane from the sabatier process here on earth goes into methane methane blasts off never to return global warming solved heh
spacex,not_removed,seems unlikely elon mentioned in the press conference that wed see it in the next few months
spacex,not_removed,the hold up was they didnt do much work on it while the focus was getting operational
spacex,not_removed,ill leave the link though cause now you can watch the whole thing if you didnt catch it on time like the webcasts
spacex,not_removed,requirements for the uplink are based on the size and sensitivity of the satellites receiving gear a larger satellite with a much more powerful antenna could potentially talk to current or similar sized cell transcievers
spacex,not_removed,valid point the volume of upload data is comparatively insignificant compared to the enormous volume of downloaded data for the vast majority of cell phones but video communications facetime skype periscope usage is growing but as i said i really have no idea what specific strategy spacex plans to adopt that will allow its capabilities and technologies to generate real revenue over the next years
spacex,not_removed,youre essentially proposing that the ship be broken into two parts a second stage and a payload module with something like a docking port the two pieces would have to be able to dock in space and survive reentry and the second stage would have to survive reentry without a module attached its a good idea and a very flexible architecture but there are nontrivial engineering challenges involved
spacex,not_removed,i would love it if every launch stream they had an update segment where they talked about any progress made on the its since the last launch like a fireside chat of sorts
spacex,not_removed,i like the window design the third slide of the httpwwwspacexcomsitesspacexfilesmarspresentationpdf gives me goosebumps every time i see it
spacex,not_removed,maybe someone has explained to him about hd video cameras and widescreen tvs since then
spacex,not_removed,we will rule out bezos because he has competing projects of his own but i guess the google guys are pretty interested they already put into spacex iirc they might bring along some of their tech billionaire friends the problem is that most of them tech billionaires all seem to have space ventures of their own
spacex,not_removed,i disagree i think it would be a mistake best to focus on the vehicle you eventually want to make a smaller its would need a lot of specific development and tooling that could not just be reused for the larger one falcon heavy is harder than expected the falcon is no longer made the falcon was never a thing those are all in part related to the fact that several vehicle types also mean several rd programs and manufacturing lines
spacex,not_removed,spacex never said its required government support no but he did communicate that hed love nasa to be on board and that the funding was uncertain underpants etc his development cost estimate of was probably also very conservative consider that he said yesterday theyd spent about just making the first stage reusable which presumably doesnt include all the other costs like developing in the first place building the factory the launch pads etc all of which will have to be done from scratch for its similarly we know that nasa has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to dragon development and spacex likely more and dragon is pretty much all wellproven tech its is largely new unproven tech and at a large scale think how much it cost them just to lose the one development tank recently given that a fairing costs and they may need dozens of destroyed its tanks before they get it right at least with a smaller scale its they can reduce these sorts of costs and perhaps even use their existing factory with a new transport approach
spacex,not_removed,no chance but they may have a strategy with a more practical roadmap to get there i think this is fantastic
spacex,not_removed,it is just too expensive to develop separate systems i would counter that it is just too expensive to develop a system that may not have any paying customers for many years after the initial successful test flights by creating an interim its at new glenn scale they can use it for paying customers flights almost immediately sat launches then later red dragonstyle uncrewed mars landings with nasa as a customer then finally once everything is proven they can move to the fullscale its at far far lower risk
spacex,not_removed,i suppose there could be concerns with food supplies and overexposure to microgravity possible but theyll be in microgravity for much less time than many astronauts on the iss though theyll be living the rest of their lives on the minimal gravity of mars so im not sure theres as much of an issue
spacex,not_removed,no need to have people onboard during fueling just add a single uncrewed mct launch at the beginning fuel it with tankers over x launches then rendezvous a crewed transport and everyone boards a fueled ship the now empty second transport is then fueled over x launches and the cycle repeats youre offsetting the loading of people by a single cycle and before you get to the last transport you can do a cargoonly upper stage if you want or have people hanging out during fueling for just one transport versus all of them
spacex,not_removed,supplies exposure and to be honest i betting that after months of space travel youll be wanting to get out
spacex,not_removed,what lead time did that math assume the assumption was thousands of flights most of them cargo
spacex,not_removed,asteriods have lithium right and elon has a lot of rockets
spacex,not_removed,not quite making fuel on mars will be an immense challenge not because the chemistry isnt there but because the energy requirements are enormous
spacex,not_removed,the point is that it doest have to continue launching each hour just a few launches in a few hours
spacex,not_removed,in all seriousness that seems like a great way to get at the subarean water
spacex,not_removed,its not very efficient as long as you can simply pump it from the earth unless ccs power plants spread
spacex,not_removed,we might see it being used for fit checks though my guess is the few months is for fully autonomous use
spacex,not_removed,there are challenges but the original design has tradeoffs as well and the docking mechanism does not have to be so complicated since both parts are fully selfcontained it only has to be a very simple mechanical connection capable of transferring thrust load while in space on the habitat it could take the place of the vac engines and on the tanker side it could be placed behind a retractable nose section anyway this is pure speculation id be astonished if spacex did exactly this im sure they have a better idea of the design space
spacex,not_removed,this is one of the annoying things about spacex theyre so damn opaque compared to nasa or even most other launch companies we got neardaily extremely indepth updates during constellation both from official sources and much more readilyavailable leaks i can only hope the leak rate picks up because spacex officially has only gotten quieter over the years
spacex,not_removed,he knows that nothing is a replacement for the real view no matter how good reproduction gets he wants geodesic domes on mars for people to see plants in natural light and with a view on the martian landscape it is more psychology than anything else but it is important and he knows it
spacex,not_removed,a smaller its would need a lot of specific development and tooling that could not just be reused for the larger one falcon heavy is harder than expected the falcon is no longer made the falcon was never a thing those are all in part related to the fact that several vehicle types also mean several rd programs and manufacturing lines i agree with all of this but i dont think those points preclude starting with a smaller its spacex started off with the falcon because they had a lot of unfamiliar rocket technologies to nut out and they couldnt afford to fail using big expensive rockets during early testing as soon as they had the fundamental technologies working and proved to customers themselves they could build a complete working system they moved to the bigger rocket i feel as though spacex are in a similar position again but this time trying to build the falcon upfront on their earlydays shoestring budget the size disparity between a crew its and a crew its would be significant similar to falcon and falcon there are the new technologies i listed more which they need to develop a feature complete its boostershiplaunch facility is a system too expensive to reach via rapid iteration as they have with the falcon line i worry they simply will not have the resources to nut out the technology challenges and reach a mission ready system of that size in any meaningful timeframe
spacex,not_removed,the first bunch will want to be able to hit the ground running that long in microgravity will stuff them when they land and need to start a base on mars i recall scott kelly having to be carried when he came back home after a year
spacex,not_removed,or as another option just leave a tanker up there full time that allows you to launch the fuel whenever is convenient then launch the people in immediately prior to the launch window
spacex,not_removed,that answers a different question
spacex,not_removed,i mean some do and some dont
spacex,not_removed,now if only we knew someone who was poised to transform the energy industry in a way which provides for cheap long term power generation and if the place we launched from could be sunny
spacex,not_removed,my guess is the few months is for fully autonomous use why would spacex do that i cant find any reasons to do so so i dont think thatll ever happen my reasoning ocisly and jrti are barges that are currently designed to always need support ships there always is personell near anyway robots are great for things that are exactly the same every time and have to happen very fast none of these are happening here
spacex,not_removed,they cant upgrade to support falcon heavy and add the crew access arm until is up and running else theyd have to stop launching during the construction
spacex,not_removed,one big advantage is the option of a payload fairing instead of a cargo module they should be able to manage payloads over meters in diameter that way while a cargo its would never be able to do that the design as originally proposed is great for getting people to mars and not much else it sounds like theyve been thinking about ways to make it more useful for other profitable missions without taking away from the end goal
spacex,not_removed,i also really like hearing about blue origins progress hey the more reusable rockets the better but theyre even worse youre right ive noticed spacex is less and less open to their fans they dont owe me anything but it still makes me sad
spacex,not_removed,its very understandable i think during the experimental phase of drone landings with every failure there was some pretty negative poorlyinformed press they just need to make sure there is more media out there about their wellrunning commercial core business than about their experimental work its just basic pr
spacex,not_removed,theyre so damn opaque compared to nasa hmm to an extent but for years everyone was slating nasa for no updates on an actual plan to get to mars besides building slsorion thankfully the dsgdst plan was finally released this week
spacex,not_removed,hmm psychologically id rather be inside the pressure vessel with the minimum number of holes cut in it
spacex,not_removed,i agree that they are in a somewhat similar position today but in my opinion although i understand its a bigger leap the falcon is to the its as the falcon was to
spacex,not_removed,dont see why the colony ship cant be refuelled without its crew in leo they can have a skeleton crew onboard just for stationkeeping and maintenance when the actual crew do arrive the skeleton crew head back to earth id certainly love to sign up for a job like that
spacex,not_removed,wikipedia quotes musk as saying the average transport time from earth to mars using its will be days so thats less than a third of a year in microgravity plus when they get to mars theyll only need to support themselves in of earths gravity i dont think an extra days will make an appreciable difference in terms of exposure to microgravity
spacex,not_removed,thats just readjusting the sense of balance not lack of strength like they need days to adjust to microgravity when getting into space plus the doctors being over cautious
spacex,not_removed,except with gravity it wont be nearly as tough on the body but yes no doubt it will suck a bit
spacex,not_removed,i mean the energy requirement will be really really enormous i dont remember the math off the top of my head but fueling up a single its on mars within a few months will take an absurd amount of solar panels nuclear seems the only viable option imo not that thats without its dramatic challenges either
spacex,not_removed,i dont think he actually means fully autonomous more like semiautomated and possibly remotely controlled its crucial to secure the stage to the barge asap as it tends to slide around in stormy weather with the barge tipping to and fro the robot is more to speed up that process since a crew would have to motor on over and then board the barge as well as to secure the stage in possibly dangerous conditions enough storminess that the stage is sliding around and has a nonzero chance of tipping crew would not be able to board the barge under those circumstances
spacex,not_removed,the ground crew has to go through procedures after the landing is completed to board the barge and perform any actions ask a robot if it cares about safety procedures edit from press conference the robot on barge in order to secure rocket remotely we cant put people on barge when rockets sliding around droids are to remotely secure legs of rocket even in high seas we have one landing in stormy seas where only thing the kept rocket from falling overboard as it slid around barge was lip on barge
spacex,not_removed,yep slc is the critical path once they have that running they can work on without disturbing the launch schedule and launch fh without a danger of ruining the only east coast launch site
spacex,not_removed,blue have become better recently if you havent already you should subscribe to their httpswwwblueorigincominterested
spacex,not_removed,thats still not an actual plan just a general concept of operations and not a very well defined one but still if someone wanted to they could track the development for slsorion all the way from before constellation was a thing nearly daybyday there are hundreds of thousands of official news releases leaked memos presentations schematics requirements documents specifications technical reports design analysis cycle reports photosvideos etc covering every aspect of the program down to individual components they may not have been publicized but they were available on things like ntrs and leaked stuff from news sources like nsf similar case for iss and the shuttle spacex would laugh in your face if you asked them for say detailed metallurgical data on raptor or training manuals for dragon or blueprints for the tank structure or flight readiness reviews and theyd likely fire and press charges against any employee leaking those documents but thats the sort of transparency weve come to expect from nasa ffs we still dont even accurately know payload capacity
spacex,not_removed,it would not feel like you are in space at all just a big tin can
spacex,not_removed,id trust them to have engineered those holes right just like i trust the engineers at airbus and boeing plus the holes would not be cut into the cfrp i did lol at your comment though
spacex,not_removed,rationally yes but once youre in there for a few weeks submarine crews come to mind there must be some info out there on this subject
spacex,not_removed,theres way waaaay too much difference in technologies and it doesnt really look like spacex could gradually introduce them either carbon tanks afaik dont make sense in a falcon because the tank walls are loadbearing and to make a stage use raptor engines that stage needs a full redesign due to differing tank geometries and volumes even a raptorpowered reusable upper stage is a huge headache needs fh for launches suddenly youre dealing with several kinds of propellants too big for road transports etc pp and major rd expense a scaled down its just big enough to replace falcon heavy eg might end up being the easier route
spacex,not_removed,doesnt that mean youre doing twice as many launches once to get the ship skeleton crew up and then once to get the passengers up vs just sending up the ship with passengers
spacex,not_removed,excuse me i misread your comment i thought you were talking about making fuel on earth youre right it is going to be much harder on mars
spacex,not_removed,not absurd quite reasonable but once you start scaling up a classical nuke plant on mars makes sense for every few hundred thousand colonists or so its a monster project even here on earth though not to mention mars
spacex,not_removed,why not fully autonomous eventually
spacex,not_removed,people dont need to go on the barge they just need to be near enough to pilot it remotely
spacex,not_removed,what does lip mean in this context i searched in the decronym list and on wikipedia but found nothing that would fit edit i mean in the sentence only thing the kept rocket from falling overboard as it slid around barge was lip on barge
spacex,not_removed,yep im a little nervous about the possibility of a fh mishap knocking their commercial crew schedule way off to the right
spacex,not_removed,all true but of course theres a very good reason for that nasa spends taxpayer money on those things so theyre essentially owned by the public and should be very open spacex arent owned by the public and so need to protect their ip from competitors
spacex,not_removed,the walls of its would similarly be loadbearing as well right just made out of carbon fiber carbon fiber is very strong and stiff i happen to think that upgrading stage for reuse which elon has now said is back on the table would be the best possible test bed for at least some of the its technologies and would follow in the successful spacex tradition of developing and testing new technologies and capabilities as secondary and tertiary objectives of missions where the primary objective is paid for by customers these technologiescapabilities are carbon fiber tanks scaled raptor engine autogenous pressurization get rid of those pesky copvs largerlighter heat shield increased endurance direct to gso anything else i would not be entirely surprised if updating is now a part of the new timeline for its
spacex,not_removed,they dont need a scaled down its the first launch can just be with fewer people then max for testing components they can build a raptor powered grasshopper type vehicle with composite tanks but for system integration i think spacex considers the falcon and falfon heavy that test bed the heavy has engines which is more then half of the its booster and the is already proving reuse technology its not as if building a rocket half the size is going to be any easier with the new components
spacex,not_removed,the carbonfiber tank walls in its will be loadbearing suppose they build an sls competitor something reusable with about tonnes payload to leo call it a raptor fully methalox about mn of thrust assuming they hit the its target of structural mass it should have a twr of off the pad first stage would rtls the second stage could be one or two vacuum raptors twr or respectively which means it should be about meters in diameter gross mass would be about tonnes with tonnes first stage dry mass and tonnes second stage dry mass all very rough estimates but an core diameter would be a useful step up from their current line it could also be described as an expensive diversion the tooling would not carry over to its but development of the engines and composite material handling techniques would it wont be transportable by road but neither will its this lets them set up a manufacturing facility close to the pad that can be designed for building its parts down the road the larger diameter would allow for much bulkier payloads like very large habitat modules private lunar landers or even nasa mars components it should be able to put about tonnes into a lunar halo orbit for example in support of nasas gateway plans a third stage would give a payload an extra kms over leo perhaps enough for a singlelaunch crewed mars flyby the extra payload capacity should allow for secondstage recovery even for a geo deployment while not as ambitious as its this would give an intermediate step in capabilities that allows payloads to grow over time while also proving and improving complete reuse
spacex,not_removed,you could also launch a refuel ship up first and send another to refuel it until it is full then you launch the crew ship and do a single transfer this would require refuel ships in operation and only extra launch crews would only be exposed to fuel transfer event and dont have to wait around
spacex,not_removed,one its launch can carry a lot of passengers if the cargo hold is converted and you dont need to worry about living space or supplies assuming they can dock and transfer people in orbit you could send a bunch of ships up loaded with cargo do all the orbital fueling and then send one its stage with like a thousand people in it transfer the passengers to each ship in the fleet and then launch them all immediately which is only one extra launch for a fleet of ten ships and saves a bunch of people loitering in orbit for weeks or months losing bone mass and eating rations
spacex,not_removed,honestly i think enough people would still go even if it were a oneway trip initially as long as enough supplies and infrastructure were there initially to allow the colonists to build and expand the base a lot of people would be able to find meaning and fulfillment in that the idea of going there and being trapped in a bubble for life would be a tougher sell though
spacex,not_removed,sure but itll be semiautonomous at first im guessing theres no urgent need for fully autonomous operation
spacex,not_removed,because there are things that are possible and things that are useful sometimes they do not overlap
spacex,not_removed,thats plain wrong in all cases they needed to strap the booster onto the barge deck crew was used for that purpose for every barge landing until now
spacex,not_removed,it means exactly what it says more or less around the border of the barge there is a raised lip think of it like small wall around the border of the barge
spacex,not_removed,sure but we were talking about psychological effects of being in a closed space without windows hence my reference to a submarine
spacex,not_removed,i agree everything hes said recently eg the new strategy for its calling its their nextgeneration vehicle etc has suggested theyre now looking to more smoothly bridge the gap between falcon vehicles and its their strategy of tech development being paid for through real missions has been one of the key pillars of their success and they need a way to continue that into its so i agree that the most obvious way for them to do that is develop a next generation vehicle in stages similar to ula with vulcan first stage coming before aces or step evolution sls blocks booster first then upper stage then srbs for spacex this either means developing a reusable upper stage first and whether that means itll be raptor powered or not i dont know or developing a next generation booster stage first the new booster would probably compete directly with new glenn with maybe raptors and prove the carbon fibre raptor and landing cradle techs it would also have the payload capacity to support a future fullyreusable upper stage
spacex,not_removed,its not as if building a rocket half the size is going to be any easier with the new components it will be easier because everything the rocket is made with eg enormous carbon fibre tanks can be more affordably developed the recent loss of the first dev tank may have made them stand back and take stock of how much each lost piece of dev equipment is going to cost them and made them realise that they can only afford to work with fhnew glennclass development for now while working on so many new and unproven technologies onceif they master the carbon fibre tanks the landing cradle the inspace refuelling the spaceship edl etc then they can look at scaling it up but honestly even a functioning its that can only carry crew to mars and back would almost undoubtedly secure massive government funding and be the death knell for nasas current mars plans
spacex,not_removed,i agree but keeping the end goal in mind it makes most sense to use the same diameter but make the booster shorter as short as possible that means if that works out the end result would just be a stretched version like the initial falcon was a shorter version of the current version also means they can keep using the same tooling which given the scope is probably the most important part long term and they can still reduce the amount of engines needed that way which is the bulk of the cost reduction another crazier idea which elon already mentioned is turning the its ship into an intercontinental transport system without the booster cram as many seats in the thing as possible with minimal life support and you can turn it into a continent hopper that way you probably dont need the vacuum rapors either
spacex,not_removed,could you imagine the risk of that though if god forbid something went wrong the entire mission has failed and more importantly people killed just for risk reduction i cant imagine the whole fleet going up at once
spacex,not_removed,hell if you told me the ship leaves tomorrow and we could be reasonably certain they would keep coming and i wouldnt starve to death id be calling my mom and hopping on a plane to florida regardless if that ship was coming back or not lol
spacex,not_removed,sorry i meant that they only need to be close enough to pilot the robot remotely actually making the robot autonomous isnt really necessary since they need a manned boat out there to tow the barge back to port anyways
spacex,not_removed,thanks for the answer i didnt know the word could be used like that
spacex,not_removed,a core would add a lot of commonality to the final its and eliminate some of the objections about tooling it would be a comically stubby rocket especially next to the provided the raptor engine is less than about meters diameter you could fit of them in a ring around the outer edge of the booster for the booster to hold engines they need to be no larger than meters a raptor might actually beat sls block for both mass and volume of payloads interesting
spacex,not_removed,it increases the odds of everyone dying but it reduces the risk of anyone dying the perperson risk is the same so its morally neutral either way so the real question is which option is worse from a pr perspective i think in general the way the media public outrage reacts isnt proportionate to scale theyll react more to a thousand people dying than a hundred but not ten time more so from a pr perspective a lower risk of a bigger catastrophe might be a win
spacex,not_removed,absolutely vacuum is easier than deep sea cratering of the windows could be mitigated by some shielding like the cupola on the iss but i dont think theyre planning to do that
spacex,not_removed,its an abomination between the saturn and falcon series vehicles obviously an artistic work the trailer shows close ups of the engine very merlin like
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if elon knows about this credit for spotting goes to udetectivespacewizard i guess he plays it wait a minute that could be elon udetecticespacewizard
spacex,not_removed,hi your submission was removed from rspacex for breaking our httpwwwredditcomrspacexwikirules posts should be about spacex please check our rules to see examples of what content is and is not allowed thanks thanks for understanding this is so we can keep rspacex the very best spacex discussion board on the internet if you feel this removal was made in error please about the removal of my submission
spacex,not_removed,it is supposed to be a deep space mission so it could be a lesser than bfr for straight up dragon ii launches say going to titan
spacex,not_removed,page httpmimgurcomastmqm
spacex,not_removed,omg you crushed my hopes and dreams initially because that title made me think that spacex had released an official teaser for the iac but you definitely salvaged it beautiful concise video and bachs prelude in c minor is always a classic
spacex,not_removed,watching this video made me think about the and then just wondering a bit about what might get unveiled at this announcement could he be showing off a bit of the bridge for the mct no doubt there are going to be some that show off the upcoming hardware sure there will be the dry that will go with the announcement but i expect that there will be a bit of splash and showmanship going on here too either that or a whole bunch of spacex fans are going to be pissed that the announcement is going to be about a new porthole design on the commercial crew dragon and no discussion at all about going to mars all in all though excellent video in particular i loved the shot of the falcon launch at the beginning
spacex,not_removed,nicely done love the ending falcon has landed d
spacex,not_removed,great video reminds me of the gran turismo opening
spacex,not_removed,its very nicely done i was waiting for the and returned it showing dragon coming back to earth though
spacex,not_removed,really great work i love the mature sombre tone set by the music pacing and choice of font you know this is serious business id almost love it if this is how spacex tones their official releases sort of a this stuff is serious tonal shift as compared to their previous awesome output as firstposts go this is an instant classic i definitely think you should post this in other subreddits rspace at the very least if not rvideos as well
spacex,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commentbig fu falcon rocket used in this commentmars colonial transporter used in this commentrapid unplanned disassembly rapid unscheduled disassembly rapid unintended disassembly decronym is a community product of rspacex implemented im a bot and i first saw this thread at aug utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
spacex,not_removed,very well done
spacex,not_removed,elon has been specific about how this is the unveiling for the bfr and mct plans and the overall mars architecture no hardware at all not the kind of venue even to set up some props at those kind of unveilings will come later from spacex facilities
spacex,not_removed,a full scale raptor on the stage would really make a significant impact especially to prevent vapourware comments
spacex,not_removed,preceded with the bang bangbang
spacex,not_removed,good point the video is definitely short on dragon and shots mostly because the available footage aside from ascent is limited to testing tether and abort tests and still photographs of sea landings
spacex,not_removed,thanks i really appreciate the positive feedback i too think that the spacex pr department should release some serious toned videos is there a pr department in conceptualizing this video i tried to imagine the tone carl sagan might have adopted if he were still alive and working on a piece about spacexs accomplishments and ambitions and to bring a certain amount of that tone to the piece on your suggestion i will attempt to crosspost this video to rspace and rvideos thanks again
spacex,not_removed,it should be pointed out that events could still derail the announcement of this megarocket as this announcement was supposed to be made much earlier too or elon musk could simply say you know what it is still premature to bring out the bfr id say it is pretty unlikely for that to happen given the hype that has gone into this speech but it still could be a major let down for spacex fans
spacex,not_removed,true but the email from the iac which gave a different title description for elons presentation kind of spread doubt that this is not going to be the big reveal were all waiting for and i reckon its still not completely clear dont want to be the buzzkiller around here but im a bit anxious
spacex,not_removed,taking a raptor to mexico would probably get elon thrown in jail
spacex,not_removed,while an actual raptor on stage be unlikely a video of a raptor test fire is entirely possible
spacex,not_removed,glad you noticed the double sonic boom
spacex,not_removed,something i should have mentioned in my root post but was reminded of by this conversation and will post here because its semirelevant is unless im mistaken the plural of spacecraft is spacecraft without the trailing s is it a personal preference one like ten fish and ten fishes also on a thematic note i felt like the imminent crew dragon program should have been noted somehow i appreciate that you cant cram too much information into a teaser like this its a feeling more than a criticism because this was really really good
spacex,not_removed,you may like to post it on the tmro tv site run by benjamin and cariann higginbotham both work at spacex but i believe that bens job at spacex is involved with video work httpswwwredditcomrtmro
spacex,not_removed,hes been chomping at the bit to tell everyone about it hes made that pretty clear in recent interviews
spacex,not_removed,im not worried about that elon has quite specific and the releases from the iac have been inconsistent all along
spacex,not_removed,only if it was done without permission i highly doubt that a big rocket cone that shows the scale of the raptor engine is necessarily going to be showing all that many secrets that cant be otherwise obtained from public domain sources
spacex,not_removed,possible but i think unlikely given comments that suggested a test fire in a few months
spacex,not_removed,nice touch loved it
spacex,not_removed,regarding spacecraft i think youre correct it seems that some authorities accept spacecrafts as a correct spelling merriam webster but the dominant consensus is that the singular should also be used for the plural whoops as for the crew dragon i seriously considered it but i couldnt think of a good way to work it into the structure and i also didnt want to claim the accomplishment for spacex when they havent yet sent anyone to space even if its imminent
spacex,not_removed,interesting suggestion but unless im missing something it doesnt look like nonmods can post to rtmro
spacex,not_removed,yes but it would still be difficult to justify the announcement if say another rud happened that would seriously stall the hype we all hope spacex has put their issues behind them but mission failure is always lurking
spacex,not_removed,when you say elon has been specific when where did you get a fax id like to know which tweet or interview you are referring too thanks
spacex,not_removed,as for the crew dragon i seriously considered it but i couldnt think of a good way to work it into the structure and i also didnt want to claim the accomplishment for spacex when they havent yet sent anyone to space even if its imminent i totally get that its just a mild pity they havent achieved that yet really especially since its soclose
spacex,not_removed,hope ok with you i sent it to tmro with your reddit contact details httpswwwredditcomuserspacenouveau
spacex,not_removed,the redcode interview is one source the i remember that is easy to point to but i know it wasnt the first that one is easy to use as a source because they press him on details about bfr and he smiles and says they have to wait until september still
spacex,not_removed,i think the iac reveal was first mentioned by elon sometime in january but the latest information we have is this interview from june in which he says hed unveil the system at a conference in september
spacex,not_removed,not at all thanks for doing so
spacex,not_removed,summary his goal with tunnelling is to improve the efficiency of the boring machinery by to enable more advanced transport systems for cities he wants to move away from roads to tunnel networks makes a lot of sense the only part that surprises me is that local governments will allow them to dig a hole and test this stuff in the middle of a developed area
spacex,not_removed,this website is infected with malware the real website is not iafastroorg edit website is legit but apparently hijacked
spacex,not_removed,follow the conversation on social media we are on facebook twitter linkedin instagram and youtube that sounds great livestream were we go
spacex,not_removed,the site is legit but hijacked it redirects me to a an adware installation page
spacex,not_removed,my norton says this is an infected page
spacex,not_removed,definitely getting redirected to malware needs addressing immediately
spacex,not_removed,both should be valid websites httpiimgurcomtinlxctpng notice the same organization and the same address for both looking even closer you can see that the registrants email address for the domain is infoiafastroorg so it seems to be a legit website im not getting any malware reports from my virus scanner but it could be a false positive i checked with httpssafewebnortoncomreportshowurliafastroorg httpswwwgooglecomtransparencyreportsafebrowsingdiagnosticurliafastroorg and httpscanurlnetuiafastroorguesbcheckthisurlresults and none of them report any problems
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,please report the site then with a screenshot if possible to httpswwwgooglecomsafebrowsingreportbadware or the site owners or both
spacex,not_removed,why would it redirect you to that and not redirect me to the same page perhaps i should readjust my security settings
spacex,not_removed,i dont think it is i have norton and im fine the story itself reads as legit
spacex,not_removed,the first time i went to the website it blue screened up with the typical your browser has been blahblahblah please put your info in this special box blahblah so maybe youre right it could be legit yet still hijacked
spacex,not_removed,it only redirected me the first time i visited perhaps it only redirects a certain percentage of people visiting the site or based on certain other parameters
spacex,not_removed,can anyone post a screenshot and if you find anything httpswwwgooglecomsafebrowsingreportbadware because at the moment none of the diagnostic tools im running are reporting any issues
spacex,not_removed,i visited again to take a screenshot and didnt get redirected so maybe its random or based on some other condition

spacex,not_removed,human on mars in this seems masturbatory at best edit the mars part is pretty cringe worthy

spacex,not_removed,what does this guy even know what hes talking about elon musk cant run for president
spacex,not_removed,i had to quit halfway through nannuhrnegnaalugy
spacex,not_removed,i mean its just one thing after another falcon heavy putting dragons on mars every ten days using made up plant life to turn dirt into oxygen using that made up plant life to remove the nitrogen in the soil that plants would actually need and that isnt in abundance on mars in any case using nanotechnology as a clumsy bat with which to swat away technical impossibilities did this come from the unofficial spacex facebook page
spacex,not_removed,that launch cadence is getting where it needs to me
spacex,not_removed,as one leaves another arrives good to see spacex getting in the routine of things this should bode well for another on time launch of falcon with eutelsat b abs
spacex,not_removed,butbut why do they need another one they already have three with fourth on the way back d
spacex,not_removed,weve definitely been spoiled in the last hours here we were yesterday hours before the launch feeling that likelihood of launch was and here we are now having seen a launch having seen amazing reentry video successful landing and now the cherry on top the next stage motors into cape canaveral to be launched days from now nice thanks uslaunchreport for being apparently the only group to see the incoming stage
spacex,not_removed,giant red and blue gauges on the back trailer clamp really want those hydraulic pressures checked
spacex,not_removed,this launch cadence is too good to be true still hasnt sunk in yet
spacex,not_removed,looks like they have a fulllength cradle inside the plastic wrap you can see the bulge on the lower side of the rocket could be some protection too so a minor side collision doesnt bend the rocket some interesting bulges around the top of the rear too structure to hang the engines off maybe supporting them on their crosscountry ride
spacex,not_removed,i just wish spacex had a good reason to try to break the day record to see this rocket go from trailer to orbit in such a short time obviously safely not rushed would be so amazing perhaps later this year it will happen
spacex,not_removed,i was always really good at guessing what was wrapped up inside my presents pretty sure i can ping that one too i feel sorry for the upset birds at the end though
spacex,not_removed,wowsa look at the speed they have going i wonder why the boosters going from portksc were travelling so slowly
spacex,not_removed,how is that rear bogie steering
spacex,not_removed,the legs are already attached have not seen that before edit rticklestuff is correct its too small to be the legs but there is some structure running diagonally from the attachment points under the wrap that doesnt look familiar
spacex,not_removed,are those new retainment rings trailer support structures looks pretty nifty either way
spacex,not_removed,so they were briefly full up with cores at the cape and a hanger with a capacity thought was on the launch pad and are about to be shipped out by road to texas and to hawthorn
spacex,not_removed,crossing my fingers im hoping to be there if they push it back much further ill miss it
spacex,not_removed,and then the first one comes back again
spacex,not_removed,velcome to ze hyoodraulic oh wait nvm
spacex,not_removed,its not a cradle just the reflection of the lighter shade of the road the is held via the same top and bottom points as the rings after a port canaveral transport
spacex,not_removed,once they start regular reuse and can focus on mass producing and transporting upper stages theyll probably be able to do launches every few days given adequate demand
spacex,not_removed,one is carefully wrapped and secured for long distance transport on a trailer another is an used one not carefully prepped wrapped for move and using those kmag platforms as a trailer to ensure better turning in tight spots why hurry with the used one the distance is short
spacex,not_removed,is how fast they go from texas
spacex,not_removed,you still havent its the place the legs would bolt on they are a lot bigger and would flare out a lot more than that even the leg streamlining attachments arent on yet the only major protrusion is the fts channel that goes along the whole rocket at the top on the viewers side in this video
spacex,not_removed,having rewatched it after you suggested that i can see it that way too the shape of the bulge seems to change with angle so you are probably right
spacex,not_removed,well when you put it that way its pretty obvious haha
spacex,not_removed,a quick and dirty timelapse video of the spacex dragon grapple from the iss robotic arm dragon stationkeeping and postgrapple oscillation beautifully visible
spacex,not_removed,anyone know how the mice are doing
spacex,not_removed,nasa video now posted
spacex,not_removed,ive tuned into the nasa stream about seconds after the capture not sure if that was the best or the worst timing
spacex,not_removed,what the heck i thought i watched it live at httpswwwnasagovnasalive
spacex,not_removed,dragon autonomously fires its maneuvering thrusters in very short bursts often firing multiple thrusters in the same second it moves to specific positions relative to iss and eventually gets to a location close enough for an iss robotic arm to grapple it very impressive to watch
spacex,not_removed,very frustrating im watching the httpwwwustreamtvchannelliveissstream and they apparently just opened the hatch only theyre not showing the hatch on stream just the outside of dragon the nasatv stream is showing the grapple repeated for at least the time something is happening now and theyre not showing it only mission control at houston can see the activity edit by hatch i think they meant the area between the iss and dragon not the dragons hatch
spacex,not_removed,i thought that dragon could dock itself rather than being berthed
spacex,not_removed,when will the dragon be birthed and unpacked
spacex,not_removed,just wondering why does it take several days between launch and docking could it be done faster in an emergency
spacex,not_removed,do we know if dragon is heated and insulated if so to what approx temperature im wondering whether the mice have separate heating and other perishables like ice cream etc are cool box stored
spacex,not_removed,when will they open the hatch

spacex,not_removed,does somebody know whether the hatch opening for dragon will be streamed somewhere it is not listed in the httpswwwnasagovmultimedianasatvschedulehtml
spacex,not_removed,what happens to the dragon capsule after it is unloaded
spacex,not_removed,love the shot of dragon from the httpswwwnasagovmultimedianasatvindexhtmlpublic with mountain ranges drifting by very cinematic
spacex,not_removed,god what an age to live in being able to see a rocket land vertically so perfectly from a drone discovery of a planet system and being able to see stuff like this fucking amazing
spacex,not_removed,i like the fact that you can see the relative movement of dragon compared to the space station in this spedup video when watching it live it almost looks likes its not moving yet there is clearly a lot more going on
spacex,not_removed,very nice video what a job the astronauts have
spacex,not_removed,could you make a quick and dirty version with this music i think it would be even better
spacex,not_removed,id love to see a highres version of this
spacex,not_removed,thank you
spacex,not_removed,i cant really tell how fast that thing is orbiting but does anyone know or knows how to do the math of how many earth orbits that took looks like maybe half an orbit or something to me
spacex,not_removed,that probably wont be known until they berth and unpack the dragon i dont believe they have any remote monitoring for the mouse transportation gear outside of normal temperature and electrical state of the capsule which should still be nominal at this time
spacex,not_removed,well theyre injured beyond that we dont really know anything as the others said but before the flight they had a series of bones broken science is pretty harsh sometimes
spacex,not_removed,what mice
spacex,not_removed,they get euthanized and dissected
spacex,not_removed,id call it almost perfect timing
spacex,not_removed,the worst timing was when i tuned into minutes after the landing
spacex,not_removed,live broadcast but replayed event nasa tv only has so many exciting events they tend to reply them over a few times in the next day
spacex,not_removed,on twitter is typically very quick and detailed with updates theres a chance they might post pictures or video of the hatch opening as it happens if such media is available edit dragons
spacex,not_removed,shuttle had classified missions maybe dragon has some classified cargo and theyre just not making a fuss about it
spacex,not_removed,this is httpsenwikipediaorgwikispacexdragon it can only berth the cargo and crew variants of dragon can dock it is impossible to have dragon dock with the station btw it is not a matter of avionics precision or software but simply the difference between the httpsenwikipediaorgwikicommonberthingmechanism it utilizes and the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternationaldockingadapter that dragon will use more info if you are interested httpsenwikipediaorgwikidockingandberthingofspacecraft
spacex,not_removed,dragon has to be berthed ports for docking use different hardware than ports for berthing
spacex,not_removed,theyre still working on qualifying it for docking rather than berthing
spacex,not_removed,it has already been berthed the hatch will be opened on a few hours
spacex,not_removed,theyre trying to approach something thats moving miles per hour its more fuel efficient to get up and wait a bit for the iss to catch up there does exist a fast track launch profile which used by soyuz occasionally transporting astronauts which does have a rendevous but these have to be planned a bit more for orbital alignment i believe
spacex,not_removed,this happens as explained by smarter everyday has a lot to do with having your orbital speed based on your altitude higher is slower lower is faster so the trick is to time a launchorbit so two spacecraft with different orbital altitudes align at a specific point and only then can they do a burn to rendezvous
spacex,not_removed,dragon absolutely has a thermal control system but it is used for cooling not heating dragon it utilizes fluid loops that carry heat from the electronics to the radiator on the trunk there are valves that allow dragon to control the flow of hot fluid to the radiator essentially allowing dragon a thernostat i do not remember the accepted temperature range for dragon despite the controlled temperature and pressurized environment the mice have their own life support systems
spacex,not_removed,a few hours they have to preform leak checks
spacex,not_removed,it is reloaded with finished experiments and various other things that nasa would like to have back on earth for further review and also likely excess garbage if there is room then is released from the station lands a couple of days later in the pacific and is retrieved by spacex to have the contents sent back to nasa
spacex,not_removed,that link doesnt go where you think it does
spacex,not_removed,spacex has really made watching rocket launches exciting again back in the apollo days everyone stopped and watched the televised launches same with the first bunch of shuttle launches then they got common place now the excitement is back
spacex,not_removed,theres clearly lot of struggle from lots of stuff to keep dragon in place
spacex,not_removed,tried a and movement did not show up almost at all
spacex,not_removed,off the top of my head x seconds is half an hour and the iss orbits every mins so about a third of an orbit
spacex,not_removed,right but they have transported mice frequently and there is no reason to believe anything might be wrong with them
spacex,not_removed,well now we get to study bone healing in micro gravity
spacex,not_removed,but i read here somewhere that theyre gonna be injured in space station
spacex,not_removed,as part of the science on board the iss they regularly send up mice for experiments page
spacex,not_removed,the worst timing was when i tuned into about seconds before it disintegrated
spacex,not_removed,i feel ya got a thing as well for missing launchs last one was comfy eu time yet i totally forgot
spacex,not_removed,live broadcast but replayed event im a little confused what was live about this broadcast if it was of a taped event is there such a thing as a broadcast that isnt live
spacex,not_removed,suspect its more pedestrian than that they probably just dont want to leak information about the common berthing mechanism procedures or possibly spacexs proprietary connections between the iss and dragon dont think you can glean any information about classified payloads from seeing their transport bags edit i just want to see for some reason hatch opening video is only available for the first crs missions
spacex,not_removed,how can you have classified stuff on an international space station would it just be classified from the chinese
spacex,not_removed,i probably shouldnt be surprised but its really cool that there are wikipedia pages about such specific rocket parts
spacex,not_removed,berthing is not necessarily a bad thing the berthing port is about inches and the docking port is about inches larger cargo can be moved into the station through the berthing port dragon will only dock but larger sized cargo can be sent on another provider that will berth
spacex,not_removed,couldnt the dragon still drive itself into the cbm if it wanted to then it could just use a very small amount of thrust to keep itself pressed against the cbm while the crew quickly installs the bolts that hold it in theyd never do it for safety reasons but i think that could work if you had the guts and nothing to loose
spacex,not_removed,if the dragon cant dock with the iss how do they transfer the cargo as i understand it berthing just means that theyre connected via the robotic arm
spacex,not_removed,no they arent its physically not capable of docking nor is the part of the iss it attaches to youre probably thinking of the crewed spacecraft theyre developing for commercial crew expected in
spacex,not_removed,but it currently has the capabilities then right
spacex,not_removed,why does it take hours guessing process that has to be followed
spacex,not_removed,i am relatively certain dragon catches up since its in a lower orbit than the iss meaning it is going faster no the other way around soyuz indeed has a if yourre interest nasaspaceflight has very good articles in general
spacex,not_removed,ahh thanks great info
spacex,not_removed,awesome thought it might take a couple of days
spacex,not_removed,it is reloaded with finished experiments and various other things that nasa would like to have back on earth for further review and also likely excess garbage if there is room im picturing a bunch of fancy experimental equipment with a few black garbage bags tossed in i know its wrong but still amusing
spacex,not_removed,ha you scared me then it was hd at the time
spacex,not_removed,i look forward to them being boring again
spacex,not_removed,absolutely as well as the extra magic of what theyre doing they simply know how to put on a show compare the launch to the soyuz launch a couple of days later from viewing spectacle to level of media coverage and straight number of views on youtube the differences are stark
spacex,not_removed,one thing kerbal space program really helped me finally intuitively grasp was how two objects cant exactly share an orbit unless theyre directly in front of behind oneanother side by side theyll cycle close then away on a repeat below one will move ahead above itll fall behind the little expenditures of effort to maintain relative position over a minute orbit make a lot of sense once youve done docking in semirealistic or better simulator i mean i knew this stuff from study and all but that intuitive grasp that came a lot later
spacex,not_removed,do they have enough food and water to hold by themselves
spacex,not_removed,true science is pretty harsh sometimes
spacex,not_removed,i read they already had their bones broken on the ground if thats a mistake then i welcome correction
spacex,not_removed,interesting
spacex,not_removed,i think this one takes the cake going from anticipation to excitement and then to dread in seconds
spacex,not_removed,i forgot to set an alarm to remind myself to watch and then suddenly remembered i opened the youtube stream and glanced at the screen and saw the launch pad and felt happy that i hadnt missed it i remember them looking at the countdown clock and saw that it was orange for a hold no worries these things happen i turned on the sound and heard something to the effect of uuuuhh we are instituting procedure blah blah blah remain at duty stations and stand by i thought that was weird and hadnt heard that kind of thing in aborts or pauses before i finally paid full attention to what i was looking at the pad was empty but the clock had stoped wtf a bad feeling set in and shortly thereafter the host of the webcast said that an anomaly had occurred and the loss of the falcon appeared to have occurred man that felt awful
spacex,not_removed,i meant that this was the streamed nasa tv channel not a youtube uploaded video but the stream was showing a replay
spacex,not_removed,probably just classified from the general public im sure all the governments and their agencies involved have all the information they would need about the cargo its also possible they just dont want the image of dead or mangled mice being broadcast in case something went wrong
spacex,not_removed,i do not think that china is part of the international space station this is why they are developing their own space program practically from scratch
spacex,not_removed,but larger sized cargo can be sent on another provider that will berth or the same provider using a reused dragon the rest of spacex contract going forward will fly in flight proven spacecraft
spacex,not_removed,yeah but berthing is really designed for permanent things like new modules im sure they designed it to work equally well for temporary cargo ships but if they could build a larger docking module i think they would i think with current tech it just wouldnt be safe
spacex,not_removed,berthing refers to mating operations where an inactive modulevehicle is placed into the mating interface of another space vehicle by using a robotic arm mating means that the spacecraft and the station are joinedmated because the modern process of unberthing is manually laborious berthing operations are seen as unsuited for rapid crew evacuations in the event of an emergency to make it as clear as possible docking means that a spacecraft mates to the station under its own steam berthing means that a spacecraft comes close to the station and then the station grabs it and mates to it no sexual innuendo intendedp
spacex,not_removed,to add to what dante said once the arm positions the dragon to the mating surface astronauts manually bolt the dragon to the station
spacex,not_removed,expected in only by realists personally im still drinking the november kool aid
spacex,not_removed,dragon does not have autonomous docking capability
spacex,not_removed,no it doesnt have the software and hardware for docking operations although they are developing those for dragon also dragon carries a berthing port not a docking port the berthing port is a lot bigger than a docking port this is the same system used to add a new module to the iss again dragon will have a docking port
spacex,not_removed,software wise maybe if they have code already there for dragon but hardware wise no different connections it can probably get there with controlled cold gas thrusters but cant connect dock and probably needs other sensing hardware
spacex,not_removed,the docking port is like a snapin connector the berthing port is more like a screwon connector but not literally a ship equipped with a docking connector can drive straight in to an open docking port on the station and snap in to place a ship equipped with a berthing connector has to be grabbed by the arm and screwed on to a free berthing port dragon only has a berthing connector
spacex,not_removed,besides leak checks there are also thermal issues temperatures have to equalize so that the seals are stable and there is a spec that says if they turn the bolts too fast either motors or friction i forget which can cause heating that warps the interface causing leaks
spacex,not_removed,they have to preform perform leak checks in between dragon and node
spacex,not_removed,under different circumstances they may wait a little while depending on scheduling but in this case there is timesensitive cargo onboard mice for example so there is extra motivation to get the hatch open sooner than later
spacex,not_removed,boring is a different musk venture but seriously it would be nice to see a faster pace of successful missions to the point where at least some of them are viewed as routine
spacex,not_removed,visitor whoa whats that florida resident hmm what visitor is that an earthquake florida resident oh that its just the mars launch youll hear that a lot this week sorry about the noise itll quiet down when the convoy leaves orbit i swear so anyways lets get back to talking about something more exciting why you should buy this timeshare i dont know if it will get that boring but fingers crossed i do wonder if boca chica will end up on the menu for its somehow theres that limited launch azimuth issue but having their own range
spacex,not_removed,which is a shame because in a way it was just as historic a launch since it was the last soyuzu to ever fly after years and nearly flights then again soyuzfg and most soyuz rockets look almost the same so most people will never notice
spacex,not_removed,just being able to watch on youtube if you missed it live is awesome much much different from watching neal armstrong step onto the moon live on my parents inch black and white tv
spacex,not_removed,obligatory xkcd
spacex,not_removed,iirc the allowance was for a days delay on launch and a days delay on berthing this situation where both occured would of course be pushing the limit on those time frames so my deduction is that they should be ok if very hungry
spacex,not_removed,it was said they have enough supplies in their habitat
spacex,not_removed,yes they wouldnt send them up there so see if they survived without the things they need to survive
spacex,not_removed,my friend and i were in a skype call during the hyper loop racing stream and he refreshed his page cause the stream froze and by the time it reloaded the pod had already launched
spacex,not_removed,i was cutoff from the world at the family cottage during crs one of my uncles knowing im a space fan showed up and did you see the iss rocket explosion you mean antares back in december no the one last week with the capsule space somethings managed to narrow down it didnt happen right on takeoff so couldnt be antares it was going for a minute or two then the front fell off and boom was a few weeks before i had tubes access again spent the whole time in disbelief and denial theres no way a falcon exploded
spacex,not_removed,ok thats what i thought you meant but i wasnt sure so basically live broadcast broadcast youre saying live doesnt add any meaning to the phrase my guess as to why the channel is called nasa live would be a little different its the channel on which nasa broadcasts all live events though not only live events either way i guess
spacex,not_removed,very cool source
spacex,not_removed,i see thanks
spacex,not_removed,thanks
spacex,not_removed,perform to do something to act preform to form buildcreate ahead of time
spacex,not_removed,also progress is supposed to dock hours after dragon was captured busy times on the iss
spacex,not_removed,usually ice cream is motivation enough to get them ahead of schedule but this time it is probably the science payloads after days of delays
spacex,not_removed,plus its in texas a much better location sorry not sorry for my bias
spacex,not_removed,wow i watched the launch and didnt have a clue thanks for the extra info i agree its a shame the soyuz programme is astonishing in its own right and i expect it will be quite a few years before spacex get close to some of the launch frequency and reliability milestones that it reached decades ago which i guess reinforces quite how good the spacex publicity is
spacex,not_removed,definitely i woke up at the day before the latest crs mission only to see the mission scrubbed the next morning i just couldnt wake up that early again i need my sleep but i knew i could catch it on youtube as soon as i woke up
spacex,not_removed,thats perfect i didnt get the physics degree but other than that i literally did work for nasa before getting ksp and would say the curve is pretty much exactly right for me too
spacex,not_removed,mice that get too hungry will eat each other
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,oh i agree i also missed the start of the coverage of the scrubbed launch but was able to jump in and rewind live to watch from the start such a useful feature
spacex,not_removed,as a professor i think a lot about ksp as a teaching tool ksp does very well for teaching the basics of orbital mechanics and the rocket equation with a mod that displays deltav because it gives you the chance to play around and see what happens its like learning the equation for parabolic motion vs throwing around a ball id love to have an equivalent program for the topics i teach
spacex,not_removed,they would be transported in separate cages right
spacex,not_removed,what do you teach maybe we know of something out there
spacex,not_removed,how would they eat each other then
spacex,not_removed,biology actually what i really want is an updated version of sim life i played the heck out of that as a kid
spacex,not_removed,life will find a way considering they need at least a few days or a week of supplies long enough for the experiment to observe their rate of healing while in microgravity i dont think there was a risk
spacex,not_removed,im not a video editor by any means but i wanted to see if i could do something like this for some reason this song really stuck with me so i started to think out a small video i could make i wanted to go in chronological order but i ended up putting things were they felt good hope you guys like it
spacex,not_removed,gave me the inspirational tingles
spacex,not_removed,theres something about vimeo that just makes videos so much more quality
spacex,not_removed,i cried thanks for this
spacex,not_removed,dude i love it nearly brought a tear to my eye i have cnc programmed a couple of parts for spacex it is awesome seeing just a tiny bit of what you have worked on being put to use i cant wait to see what they do in the next ten years
spacex,not_removed,im crying because this video just made me realize my passion is space and exploration i watched this video and within minutes i was at a college signing up to start my degree in engineering thank you
spacex,not_removed,that was mesmerizing thanks op thanks elon thanks spacex thanks guys the future sure starts to look really bright
spacex,not_removed,really nice editing and a great music choice
spacex,not_removed,my only nitpick is the order why show the failure then the successful landed first stage and then back to the failed landings i think the chronologic order is way more dramatic ocean attempts failed barge landings failure then boom rtls success
spacex,not_removed,you did a great job some shots in there i hadnt seen before it ranks closely up there with this one bravo
spacex,not_removed,i cried great job op
spacex,not_removed,pretty good stuff better than i could do the nerd in me is slightly irritated that you have the time lapse of the landed stage before showing the actual landing

spacex,not_removed,is there a such thing as loving a company too much
spacex,not_removed,that was very pleasurable
spacex,not_removed,professional video editor here you did a fantastic job dont hate on yourself love how you brought elon in at the end was a really nice touch looking forward to when spacex makes even more break throughs
spacex,not_removed,brought a tear to my eye
spacex,not_removed,great video i reckon add a bit more of that crowd cheer when landing on the boat to give it some extra emotional impact
spacex,not_removed,nice job cant wait to see the highlights reel years from now
spacex,not_removed,great video good song good selection of clips from spacexs history good transitions thought i would get tired of montages but this one hit me right in the feels
spacex,not_removed,really amazing job it was well edited sensible music the audio wasnt unnecessary it was just all good congratulations on completing it and all the praise youre getting it was really incredible
spacex,not_removed,well done video but in the middle you had an landing on the drone ship and the drone ship rocket back and forth in the waves a bit after the landing i have never seen that clip before what mission was that from and do you have the source for that video it was really cool to see the droneship rocking from the impact while the stayed upright on the x
spacex,not_removed,op this video is amazing so awesome
spacex,not_removed,really nice editing and great song choice you should make more of these maybe different themes or different launch providers it brought back the feels i had during the orbcomm landing in
spacex,not_removed,this was amazing great inspiration thank you and i hope you continue to make more in the future
spacex,not_removed,great video perfect start into a new week cheers maybe i missed it but what is this song called it fits perfectly btw
spacex,not_removed,my roommate works at spacex gonna pass this on to him
spacex,not_removed,hope someone would use this track for the mars timeline video
spacex,not_removed,keep up the good work
spacex,not_removed,beautiful and spinetingling thank you
spacex,not_removed,man seriously that was amazing thank you for making that really moved me
spacex,not_removed,still gives me chills everytime i watch that orbcomm landing
spacex,not_removed,what a match btw scene and sound this makes me think i wanna be an engineer thanks op by the way elon is such a magical guy
spacex,not_removed,this is the song from the the little prince trailer right
spacex,not_removed,there are some epic as all hell shots in there top notch video right here
spacex,not_removed,im really glad you put the rapid unscheduled disassemblys in there always good to show that the road to success isnt without hiccups
spacex,not_removed,fantastic also very much agree with your statement thank you elon musk and all of the spacex team for igniting a generations interest in space exploration ive had hour long conversations with friends about rockets space since space x has started doing landings and many other incredible accomplishments cant wait for the mars missions to start falcon heavy going to be an incredible event soon as well great video
spacex,not_removed,really incredible inspirational and well edited
spacex,not_removed,i dont think ive ever seen that footage around is that a booster about the land what mission is that from
spacex,not_removed,love this thanks for all the effort you put into it 😊
spacex,not_removed,whats the music
spacex,not_removed,soyou try getting spacex to buy this from you this looks so professional and awesome honestly wow
spacex,not_removed,other videos in this thread videocomment woo my main inspiration for this was we stopped dreaming which makes me cry every time i watch it you did a great job some shots in there i hadnt seen before it ranks closely up there with this one bravo hope someone would use this track for the mars timeline video im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
spacex,not_removed,rspacex is starting to get cluttered with montages just like it got cluttered with lego falcon builds there was one posted just days ago
spacex,not_removed,looks great you had me fooled about not being a video editor the cheering always makes a tingle run through me my only comment is showing one of the failed barge landing attempts and then cutting to a successfully recovered first stage might want to consider showing a successful landing before a recovered stage i really need to read through the other comments first just noticed you answered my concerns already
spacex,not_removed,i like your work but i would have done one thing differently to me the story of spacex starts with the failed launches one of the most inspirational quotes in the whole world to me is from elon just a few days before they finally had a successful falcon launch optimism pessimism fuck that were going to make it happen as god is my bloody witness im hellbent on making it work sort of the modern version of theodore roosevelt s it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat anyway i would have started off with video of a failed launch
spacex,not_removed,thanks for passing along the feels very good montage of all the videos ive watched over the years that really piece it together in an inspiring format well done
spacex,not_removed,thats what i was going for
spacex,not_removed,absolutely did the same for me also in case youre wondering its called httpsenwikipediaorgwikifrisson
spacex,not_removed,i think it has to do with vimeo being more focused on professional work from artists and such youtube just gets cluttered with so much crap because thats where people go when they made some random thing and want a big audience not to say yt doesnt have quality content so then the people that upload to vimeo are more likely to be the kind who spend a bit more time on their work and arent just looking for a bunch of quick views not to mention vimeo uses a higher bitrate than youtube
spacex,not_removed,woo my main inspiration for this was which makes me cry every time i watch it
spacex,not_removed,glad to see i wasnt the only one
spacex,not_removed,thats awesome
spacex,not_removed,thanks i must admit i saw it recently in a trailer for the little prince and thought it would be an awesome song for a spacex video
spacex,not_removed,i agree the order is seemingly random it was made more for people who dont follow spacex as much that might want to get into the scene i wanted to make it as entertaining as possible with my somewhat limited editing skills so i took the low hanging fruit scenes i appreciate the feedback though
spacex,not_removed,i appreciate the feedback i have never seen this video but i love it
spacex,not_removed,if it makes you feel better i felt really bad about that i really wanted a time lapse though and it was the only one i could find
spacex,not_removed,thank you so much
spacex,not_removed,a large part of the rocking was the weather conditions the waves were up to m there they really didnt think they were going to stick the landing due to the wave height and winds
spacex,not_removed,that was from you can find it on spacexs youtube channel
spacex,not_removed,song is by ks rhoads its in the description of the video sorry im in mobile
spacex,not_removed,awesome let me know what he thinks
spacex,not_removed,yup
spacex,not_removed,i appreciate the feedback thanks a ton
spacex,not_removed,thanks for watching d
spacex,not_removed,ks rhoads our corner of the universe
spacex,not_removed,somehow i think it is unlikely spacex would purchase there own footage
spacex,not_removed,thanks a ton
spacex,not_removed,is not what i would consider cluttered and the other video wasnt a montage it was narrated and was about how the landings work
spacex,not_removed,yeah that transition was a little jarring first explodes then we see a shot of a landed booster then we see some failed landings then we see a successful landing i think its fine to be nonchronological landing failures can be shown after the failure but the we shouldnt jump from disentegrating really bad day to a shot of a landed booster really good day that said im totally nitpicking great video seriously awesome that was literally my only criticism of any weight
spacex,not_removed,man i would pay to see a video of the elon quote there isnt one is there
spacex,not_removed,congratulations on a great job good story telling is all about emotional impact not empiric accuracy but i think you already know that
spacex,not_removed,not to mention vimeo uses a higher bitrate than youtube youtube bitrate limits are pretty low and you cant control that in any way really its weird theyll allow you to post mediocre quality videos but not high bitrate one if you really did need that high bitrate
spacex,not_removed,man that link is great thanks for that to me the landings must be like the early apollo missions were to people of that era not in itself the goal but a sign of something great to come
spacex,not_removed,i am not a video editor by any means but i think of the firstsecond stage burn interaction would work great in its place the videos of the dragon berthing to the iss available through nasa are great too thanks for an awesome video gave me tingles
spacex,not_removed,im one of those people and i took this as being set up for the emotional arc not as accurately chronological or even as actual storytelling for the space x story worked for me
spacex,not_removed,i agree dont get me wrong it was really well made and i thoroughly enjoyed it it will definitely be in my spacex video rotation from now on but i do wish it told the story in a bit more of a chronological sense but i sincerely hope to see more videos from you friend this was great stuff and fantastic editing edit after rewatching it again i feel like i should point out that the beginning and ending were absolutely perfect the cheering and all that and the successful landing clips are spot on it was just the clip followed by the landed first stage that threw me off overall the order really flowed emotionally
spacex,not_removed,great work man
spacex,not_removed,very true
spacex,not_removed,i agree the transitions would be cool to have more background for people who arent familiar especially with the falcon at the beginning maybe at least falcon failure and the failure then some emphasis on the importance of the return to flight and subsequent landing and i agree with what was said about and for a nonvideo editor that was some top notch videoediting as an actual nonvideo editor i dont think i could come close to doing that as well as you
spacex,not_removed,not to my knowledge it was from an interview with wired magazine
spacex,not_removed,wow i hadnt seen that video before fantastic shot
spacex,not_removed,aug at utc engine burns from first and second stages of falcon interact after last launchs stage separation httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
spacex,not_removed,the interviewer must have recorded the interview i cant believe they would eraze it
spacex,not_removed,spacex has five crew dragon spacecraft in different levels of assembly the company built and successfully tested one module to prove its environmental and life support systems and another as a structural test article the three spacecraft that will fly the flight tests and the first operational mission to the space station are in various stages of production in spacexs manufacturing facilities in hawthorne california spacex performed five drop tests to evaluate the parachutes that must deploy to allow a returned crew dragon to land safely in the water the superdraco engines that will be used on the first flight test were also hotfired to qualify them for flight the company also ran a series of qualification tests on the spacesuits astronauts will wear during missions aboard crew dragon spacecraft the evaluation included putting the suit in a vacuum chamber to see how it withstood conditions similar to those found in space outside a spacecraft spacex continued extensive modifications at launch complex during which included pad structures being refurbished or rebuilt to serve falcon and falcon heavy rockets instead of the space shuttles that previously launched from it additionally the crew access arm has been built and spacex expects to bolt it into place on the tower in the fixed service structure and its foundations were strengthened to handle higherforce hurricane winds and to provide a stronger base for the vertical integration crane planned for the complex in the future edit oops accidentally saved previous edit too notes superdracos are being used on first flight used meaning fly les or landing suits are vacuum capable not just high athmospheric vertical integration crane in progress for military launches crew access arm built
spacex,not_removed,it appears spacex is finally trying to compete for those vertically integrated air force payloads spacex continued extensive modifications at launch complex during which included pad structures being refurbished or rebuilt to serve falcon and falcon heavy rockets instead of the space shuttles that previously launched from it additionally the crew access arm has been built and spacex expects to bolt it into place on the tower in the fixed service structure and its foundations were strengthened to handle higherforce hurricane winds and to provide a stronger base for the vertical integration crane planned for the complex in the future
spacex,not_removed,shame saw both space x and boeing slip their first crewed flights from to though
spacex,not_removed,it was mentioned that spacex planned to officially unveil them soontm i wonder how close we are to that event also i noticed that the article doesnt specifically say that the suits successfully completed testingwhereas it does specifically mention that dragon life support tests were successful rather it only mentions that they were tested im hopeful but it would be really nice to know how it stood up to the environment and what mobility is like
spacex,not_removed,for once that we got a picture of pad that is not from the ground and behind an dirty bus window i wasnt going to let it be hidden by a text panel and i dont think we saw the before heres the btw you saw they are the ones who will first ride the dragon their names are suni williams eric boe and barry wilmore and i think that in two years everybody on this sub will know them

spacex,not_removed,question about the the differences in structural test articles shown in the link starliner has a kind of honeycomb outer structure which i assume is for improving the structures strength spacex is pretty much just the flat metal except around weaker areas like windows question is why do one or the other what is all that structure for and does it make one capsule better than the other
spacex,not_removed,it appears now boeing will probably beat spacex to the first crewed launch
spacex,not_removed,i spotted that too will have a short burst of sd moments before splashdown on parachute
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if theyll bolt the crew access arm on before any commercial flights from
spacex,not_removed,i wonder whether these are the i fullscale eclss and ii final spacesuit qualification tests weve been hearing inklings about if so we could be expecting some spacesuitrelated official media really soon
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if the vertical integration crane is also the one for bfrits mating on the pad was supposed to have been overbuilt enough to take bfr launches and elons mexican talk did show a stylised crane
spacex,not_removed,any leaks of the space suits no pun intended
spacex,not_removed,high atmospheric as in highpressure or high altitude
spacex,not_removed,might be wrong about this but i thought the air force wanted those payloads launched from within the air force base
spacex,not_removed,either that or theyre planning ahead for the its crane which will use the same launch pad it may well be cheaper to strengthen the tower to use as the base than to build an entirely new one with foundations
spacex,not_removed,this is probably something of a dumb question but could you please remind me on the reasons that the air force doesnt use horizontal integration off the top of my head im not exactly sure what benefits vert provides over horiz
spacex,not_removed,i believe thats the first official mention theyve mentioned vertical integration for a while and people have been assuming it would be done via crane on the fss but nice to have it confirmed
spacex,not_removed,yeah but this post is a nice reminder of all the progress that did happen that this is measurably moving forward and we can see it
spacex,not_removed,i think officially spacex only slipped the first certified flight to the crewed test flight may still be in but i may be wrong
spacex,not_removed,and i dont think we saw the before we have thats their structural test article theyve been for a while i wonder if well ever get serial numbers for these capsules itll make tracking them a lot easier
spacex,not_removed,in the crewdragon the honeycomb structure is on the inside as you can see
spacex,not_removed,the structure is designed to retain the most strength possible while removing as much mass as possible they do this by several methods one of which is milling out the negative space on the pattern to make a thick sheet of metal into a loadbearing webwork holding up a thinner atmospherecontaining skin
spacex,not_removed,my guess just as launch escape system les
spacex,not_removed,dragon crew has a landing mode called propulsive assist that uses both parachutes and superdraco engines i suspect that will not be used at first parachutes only but later might be employed as nasa starts preparing for spacex to use full propulsive landing it would make sense for each landing mode to be tested on unmanned crs missions before trying them with crew
spacex,not_removed,no actually they couldve installed it in december the reason for the delay is exactly to get the pad ready for commercial flights earlier according to kathryn lueders program manager for nasas commercial crew program spacex plans to install it in spring
spacex,not_removed,no way this is a little crane thats going on top of the fss to attach the encapsulated payload on the falcon stack it wont be able to hold anything close to an its spaceship
spacex,not_removed,meant high altitude sorry for ambiguity
spacex,not_removed,i think its a bit too early for that and i assume they will have to basically demolish and rebuild the pad altogether given the magnitude of the changes required to accomodate its but we are talking about spacex so maybe youre right
spacex,not_removed,i highly doubt that the current service structure could really be strengthened enough to lift an entire its spacecraft or tanker thats a pretty good size crane and i bet that foundation will have to be completely redone
spacex,not_removed,im by no means an expert and if you are interested you should try visit nasaspaceflightcom the spacex section is full of topics on the matter from knowledgeable people what i know is that some payloads are specifically designed to be vertically integrated and cannot be handled otherwise additionally if you offer vertical integration you also have a clean environment to access the payload while vertical and mated to the rocket this allows for last minute processingchecking that currently spacex cannot perform the environment inside the fairings has to remain clean for the satellite to function nominally so you cant open them on the pad
spacex,not_removed,unfortunately the crewed test flight was the bit that slipped if things hold we might still see the uncrewed launch in though
spacex,not_removed,from the blog post from nasa the most recent slips from the most recent previous target dates were demonstration mission unmanned from august to november slipped three months demonstration mission manned from november to may slipped six months the plan as of june was that certification review would take about six months after the manned demonstration flight i dont know whether there is a complete prohibition of another manned demonstration flight prior to certification i think certification pretty much means ok we trust the company to carry on by themselves from this point so conceivably if there were a pressing need for a manned flight they could consider allowing it with some higher level of nasa supervision
spacex,not_removed,yes i think they meant used as in these will be installed in the spacecraft
spacex,not_removed,i presume that is also their current estimate for when will be back online giving them some margin to stand down
spacex,not_removed,so basically the suit cannot function with even the smallest amount of atmospheric pressure how is that possible
spacex,not_removed,they wont be demolishing the pad to start over was way overbuilt even for the saturn v with apollo back then they werent sure just how big they would need to go so to be safe they went over even the saturn viii planned needs it will need a lot of work but at least the foundations of the pad will remain
spacex,not_removed,they didnt give a timetable on when the crane was planned for completion so its really a toss up at this point and its final use is just educated speculation i have no idea how spacex would handle ripping up the pad completely because theyll have to be supporting commercial crew during the time period theyre developing its and is the only pad capable of those launches for spacex as far as i am aware ill save any more guesses on the matter for the prediction threads
spacex,not_removed,i assume they will have to basically demolish and rebuild the pad altogether given the magnitude of the changes required to accomodate its elon mentioned in the iac talk that the pad was built strong enough that they can use it for its they wont have to demolish it
spacex,not_removed,maybe an empty its ship isnt all that heavy for a crane handling the forces of the rss would not have been trivial i can believe with reinforcements it could be strong enough
spacex,not_removed,also not an expert but some structures really dont like going horizontal like the mirrors of large telescopes the airforce has earth observing telescopes of similar scope to hubble actually the airforce has donated two telescopes of hubble size to nasa because they no longer need them they are in store and i dont know if nasa is planning to do something with them
spacex,not_removed,is more like summer thats going to be a big project and they havent done much recently while theyre trying to get up and running for rtf
spacex,not_removed,the original comment says vacuum capable which implies it can do anything from to atm
spacex,not_removed,pedant alert there is and never was such a thing as a saturn viii the proposal for a saturnseries rocket with an first stage is properly referred to as saturn the saturn and were the only two that made it past and were redesignated with roman numerals
spacex,not_removed,both elon musk and gwynne shotwell have mentioned repeatedly that is not capable of launching its however there are two different things to recognize one is the capability of the flame trench which is supposed to not be sufficient the other is the size of the pad with its safety distance to other installations thats big enough to accomodate even its i too wonder how they will implement its launch and land capability maybe the design allows for possible extensions that can mostly be done without interruption to falcon family launches or they build a separate flame trench and landing cone for its the booster is supposed to sit there until it launches again that would make falcon lauches impossible if it is the same flame trench
spacex,not_removed,they didnt give a timetable on when the crane was planned for completion so its really a toss up at this point and its final use is just educated speculation a crane for vertical integration on and fh should not be urgent they need to show how to do it any mission that requires it would take at least years after the contract is awarded plenty of time to build the crane what they need in advance of a contract is the design and the airforce approving of the design i believe that is one thing that was settled initially the airforce wanted all of those things built and proven working before they certify falcon
spacex,not_removed,what about a fully loaded tanker would they even load the tanker before lifting it onto the booster
spacex,not_removed,nasa is certainly planning to use these wfirst httpswfirstgsfcnasagov
spacex,not_removed,yes that is what i thought as well but it says the suits are not able to perform in the upper atmosphere which lies between and atm
spacex,not_removed,thank you for the correction i knew while typing out viii that it looked wrong
spacex,not_removed,what are you talking about elon and the iac presentation were explicit that the plan is to launch from
spacex,not_removed,or wait until lc and boca chica are fully online
spacex,not_removed,not a chance they would fuel it first it would be way too heavy and it would also be way more risk to move a fully fueled vehicle and integrate it with the booster
spacex,not_removed,but it says the suits are not able to perform in the upper atmosphere didnt see anything in the article that implied it cant operate in the atmosphere this is all the article said the company also ran a series of qualification tests on the spacesuits astronauts will wear during missions aboard crew dragon spacecraft the evaluation included putting the suit in a vacuum chamber to see how it withstood conditions similar to those found in space outside a spacecraft
spacex,not_removed,what are you talking about i am talking about many statements before iac and how to reconcile them with the iac statement
spacex,not_removed,boca chica can do the fh launches but would need major upgrades to do crew launches for nasa and vertical integration for airforce launches
spacex,not_removed,yeah now that you say it just the idea of lifting a fueled tanker sounds ridiculous
spacex,not_removed,ahh sorry if my post seemed like i was being short with you i was sitting on a runway and the plane started to take off mid post i will have to go back to the exact quotes but im pretty sure elon said is more built up than they previously thought and would indeed be able to serve as the pad for its
spacex,not_removed,given the reports that launch pad was essentially destroyed during the event it would seem likely to be rebuilt with support for falcon heavy launches this is an upgrade that spacex had previously planned but put aside in favor of with the pad offline for a lengthy period of time and needing a full rebuild there would seem to be little reason not to rebuild it with support for fh
spacex,not_removed,ahh sorry if my post seemed like i was being short with you no worries i will have to go back to the exact quotes but im pretty sure elon said is more built up than they previously thought and would indeed be able to serve as the pad for its if he said something like that i have missed it but me missing things is not unusual would be interesting to learn
spacex,not_removed,lotsa weasel words there theres numerous reasons not to rebuild to support fh the main one of course being its rather low flight rate it only has about half a dozen planned launches as of today spread over many years could handle it without breaking a sweat all your idea is is just a capex drain
spacex,not_removed,i would not rule it out but it would be a major change and would delay getting it back into service significantly i believe it is unlikely they want to get it back into service asap
spacex,not_removed,could handle it without breaking a sweat until theres a cato at then what then spacex goes well into the red for a year or two with few launches and no fh all your idea is is just a capex drain if the pad didnt need to be rebuilt from scratch youd be right that does not seem to be the case if the press reports are accurate the pad has essentially been destroyed it will first need to be designed from scratch then rebuilt from scratch also remember that spacex had plans to rebuild for fh the deferred likely due to the time it would put the pad out of operation and perhaps the cost both of those ships have now sailed the pad is down and the money will have to be spent whats the capex time differential between designing then building a new pad for or designing then building a pad for both both and fh given the total redundancy an fh compatible would afford the company it makes no sense not to build from scratch for both
spacex,not_removed,if the press is correct and the pad has been destroyed asap will be a year or more from the time of the incident likely longer if rebuilding there would seem little sense in rebuilding it to the the previous specification a design intended for era titan rockets the only press report on the condition of wrote in great detail as to why and how the pad was essentially destroyed spacex has not refuted that report in fact spacexs only discussions of avoided any discussion of the pad itself the pad is the heart of the complex and has the longest build times if the pad needs to be rebuilt it will first need to be designed as its quite unlikely they would rebuild it to the era spec one imagines a large reason behind spacex postponing the prior fh upgrade to was a reluctance to take the complex off line for a long period of time that ship has now sailed the complex is offline as a full rebuild seems necessary it seems unlikely theyd do anything other than rebuild to a falcon heavy spec
spacex,not_removed,until theres a cato at simple dont have launch failures spacexs entire plans depend on a series of rockets with reliabilities exceeding an order of magnitude better than todays best vehicles its silly to plan for the old when youre dreaming of the new why are you not advocating for a second pad at vandenberg then that will see far more use than the combined fh launches from a theoretical combo per year id like to see you prove your point with prudent financial analysis and math instead of just weaseling your way around the argument
spacex,not_removed,dont have launch failures thats not likely to happen the cost of innovation is failure and musk is an innovator hes going to innovate until his last breath hes not going emulate his competitors who stick with a given design for decades you can deride his approach but he has outright voting control of spacex and no one is likely to change his methods perhaps spacexs best hope is to move those failures from the launch pad to the test stand the cant currently as their test facilities cannot handle a full up stack static fire id like to see you prove your point with prudent financial analysis and math instead of just weaseling your way around the argument why so hostile where are your numbers as ive said if as press reports indicate is a total write off why wouldnt spacex spend an extra to to achieve full launch pad redundancy why are you not advocating for a second pad at vandenberg then the reason quite obviously is that spacex doesnt have a destroyed pad at vandenberg that they feel the need to rebuild they do have such a pad the cape if youre suggesting that spacex abandon entirely before spending anything on its rebuild thats a legitimate point perhaps they should but spacex has clearly indicated they plan to bring back to operations this isnt a bluesky upgrade this plan to upgrade for falcon heavy had long been on spacexs roadmap if reports are accurate and the pad will necessarily have to be reconstructed nearly from scratch what is your argument for not reconstructing it for both falon and falcon heavy
spacex,not_removed,hes going to innovate until his last breath that explains why falcon upgrades have stopped as of block then
spacex,not_removed,that explains why falcon upgrades have stopped as of block then oh wait youre serious let me laugh even harder im happy to debate this with you but you havent provided a single cogent counterpoint or rational justification for your contention that an fh upgrade would be a waste makes it difficult to take you seriously
spacex,not_removed,looks more likely this was the plane left hand sideabout a fifth downthanks to for clarification and reminder maybe this was the plane heading left just below the bright cloud with the sun behind it cant be that many planes in the area at that time at least it seemsha the rabbit hole is deep my friends
spacex,not_removed,uncomfortable flashback warning presumably shot is in the comments
spacex,not_removed,found the amatuer footage of it
spacex,not_removed,wow that just gives a sense of perspective on how high up planes travel
spacex,not_removed,yeah i though i saw a plane in the shot before the lunch i wondered if anyone would be able to see it from that distance and if so would they be smart enough to photograph itapparently they did
spacex,not_removed,that is such a cool shot what i wouldnt give to see that
spacex,not_removed,from the imgur comments im surprised theyd let an airliner that close to a launch does anyone know the security radius for other aircrafts when a rocket is launched and can estimate from the picture how many kilometres the rocket is away

spacex,not_removed,very cool
spacex,not_removed,thats amazing
spacex,not_removed,it cant be in the imgur link the description said look to the right and if they were on that plane they would have to look to the left
spacex,not_removed,lol i think i managed to call that in 🙂 passengers sitting in right side window seats of that airplane to the left of the rocket must have had a magnificent view of the launch and passengers sitting in left side window seats could perhaps have seen the reentry burn of the landing first stage a couple of minutes later and we are still waiting for pictures from the reentry burn 😉
spacex,not_removed,i believe you can actually see another plane at the top left around
spacex,not_removed,ugh the one comment unreasonably upsets me did the pilot come on the speaker to say and on our right well see how the private industry tackles space
spacex,not_removed,about cruising altitude so about of the way to the karman line
spacex,not_removed,same here
spacex,not_removed,how about a dedicated launch watch plane
spacex,not_removed,you have this blue area here and the keep out zones but besides those the planes can fly wherever they want also at that altitude anything above feet to feet you are constantly under control of atc and atc would know about the airspace restrictions and steer you clear
spacex,not_removed,not sure but i saw a shuttle launch from the air once back in the day
spacex,not_removed,yea i think you are correctthe photo looks to be taken just after mecoabout later than where the plane i highlighted was
spacex,not_removed,im pretty sure that camera is facing west which would put the plane to the west of the launch pad that means that they would have only been able to see it on the left correct me if im wrong though
spacex,not_removed,yeayou are totally right whats weird is i remember noticing both planesbut space wasp distracted me about the second one
spacex,not_removed,this is making my head hurt now
spacex,not_removed,i would say reasonably upsets
spacex,not_removed,now theres an idea
spacex,not_removed,a httpswwwgooglecomqplanechartercapecanaveral for plane charters near the cape this is definitely doable although a helicopter makes more sense
spacex,not_removed,is most likely correct that the correct plane is visible at left sidefifth downheading right
spacex,not_removed,cant see any reason why it wouldnt be possible if you could find the moneysell tickets youd just have to stay out of the appropriate area if you wanted this view coming up through the clouds it would need to be a large enough plane to have enough fuel a high enough service ceiling i guess for just watching the launch at all a smaller plane would do an independent landing chase plane would be good as well if you could get a stable enough long enough lens camera outside of the exclusion zone
spacex,not_removed,oh i see either way it would only be visible on the right side of the plane then not both still pretty sure that camera is facing west
spacex,not_removed,well lets just say im not in the financial position to do any of that so for now ill just enjoy the photographs
spacex,not_removed,west or maybe slightly north west is my best guessits possible the plane from which the photo was taken is a lot further out to sea than it first appearsand that the two planes ive highlighted are a lot closer to shorethe length of the rocket exhaust could be used to estimate the distance of the plane and pinpoint it betternot sure i am in the mood thoughmy best guess is the photo was taken post max q before or at staging
spacex,not_removed,these two images need to have some sort of permanence on this sub httpiimgurcomzjfbzzzjpg these should be our baselines for determining what is likely to be fh hardware looking at this model the structural plates offset degrees from the holddowns verify that this article is part of the fh program if you look at the you can see that both the retractable and fixed corebooster linkages are there in reality mirroring the model we should be attempting to identify future hardware from this physical model also helpful would be a disclaimer about the rendered models on the spacex website as they are not close enough to reality to be helpful in the identification of possible program hardware that is all
spacex,not_removed,from nasaspaceflight thread it would appear to be a center core
spacex,not_removed,this idea probably belongs in a separate thread but it just occurred to me why in the world is spacex wrapping new cores outside are they really that tight for space inside the factory
spacex,not_removed,does anyone know why its painted blue instead of white
spacex,not_removed,it looks like some of the compare to chuck whites
spacex,not_removed,why do they use black shrink on these i would think they would not want a brand new stage baking in the ca or fl sun im sure it can take it space is harsh but why not white
spacex,not_removed,why does the octaweb need to be reinforced is it taking any additional thrust for fh the center cores fuselage i would understand but this just makes me believe that im way out of the loop on the fh engine performance
spacex,not_removed,its not clear to me how you determined that it is an actual fh booster please explain
spacex,not_removed,this is also the core that hit the traffic light
spacex,not_removed,wait guys is that web meant to support the heat shield andor the engines because the engines are past that web do the engines attach at those steel circles further in the rocket

spacex,not_removed,the sidebyside comparison is terrific the structure framing the engines certainly appears to be heftier than before though that could be an optical illusion due to the color no question it has a different shape as op described another difference i see the used booster seems to have some ghosts visiting it i know its a long exposure seeing these cores parked out on the open road im surprised i dont see men with guns standing about im sure theres probably overlapping layers of security on these exposed boosters to prevent espionage sabotage theft etc and im not asking for details please do not share just kinda surprised all the same
spacex,not_removed,dam thanks id not seen those models before
spacex,not_removed,thanks that pretty much confirms it as the centre core
spacex,not_removed,according to an employee its so they dont need to heat the shrinkwrap material they just let the sun do or for them
spacex,not_removed,we can only hope they may have just needed to shuffle some vehiclestransporters around and needed to move it outside to accomplish it
spacex,not_removed,where do you see this
spacex,not_removed,looks like the crossbars arent straight and dip in towards the middle in that newer image you can see the crossbar a little going clockwise but its still there
spacex,not_removed,the ring appears to be inset from the fact of the structure if you httpiimgurcomcyxwoxcjpg the flanges start from close to the surface of the structure then get further and further inset until the meet the outer wall where they are
spacex,not_removed,so we have leg attachments at and direct core attachment at and what are the ones at and edit im stupid
spacex,not_removed,angle of the picture theyre in there
spacex,not_removed,the fuselage is thin and cant handle that sort of stress the majority of the force will be applied at the octoweb where the rocket is strongest as well as attachment at the top to combat the forces wanting to push the side cores inward
spacex,not_removed,it is clearly different from the current falcon full thrust structure so it is not an core we know heavy is in development but there is no indication a falcon fuller thrust iteration is in development the enhancements stronger structure directly opposed enlarged mounting flanges match those proposed for falcon heavys centre core thus we can reasonably conclude this is definitely not a normal core very likely not a new falcon design very likely a falcon heavy core and likely a falcon heavy centre core if you mean how we can determine if its a flightready core or not we cant this could just be a structural test article never intended to fly it could be a partially assembled core that may never complete assembly depending on results of testing it could be a partially constructed core that will become the first flown falcon heavy it does appear to have at least some of the manifold hardware needed for pipe propellant to the engines so its probably not just a structuraltestonly core just cutting the holes would probably be sufficient there but things change in development so this could just be a cobbledtogether core to do a specific nonflight job
spacex,not_removed,no that was orbcomm this is a new stage that hasnt left the factory yet
spacex,not_removed,it is a lot stronger than previous versions ive built both
spacex,not_removed,its actually the same model just two different angles
spacex,not_removed,thanks that pretty much confirms it as the centre core there are three properties that identify it as the center core i believe the lower attachment point is barely visible in the when zooming in through the fence two attachment points center core the beefier octaweb is a dead giveaway the side boosters can very likely use an iterated version of the existing much lighter octaweb structure with a few addons like the side attachment point length only the center core has an interstage attached side boosters end in a minimal length nose cone structure that probably house the grid fins the flight computer and the rcs thrusterstanks and i believe the length in the nfs image suggests that the interstage is already attached
spacex,not_removed,a brilliant use of raw solar power d
spacex,not_removed,to be fair that same employee seems to spout off many random statements i suspect his way around whatever ndaconfidentiality clauses they have is to simply make certain everything he says is either public or false remarks from other regulars in the fb group imply they only expect misinformation from him it seems like a big joke
spacex,not_removed,that employee is a wellknown prankster on the fb group and we allow him some leeway to see if his posts get taken up elsewhere as canon in this case it was obviously not true since the sun wouldnt be shrinking the shadow side even on fb you have to know the poster a bit to calibrate them
spacex,not_removed,so they were wrapping the speculated fh center core and unwrapping i wonder where the fh core was going
spacex,not_removed,doesnt mean they have to wrap it outside if they had the space i imagine they would prefer to do it inside less contamination and bring it outside to let it shrink
spacex,not_removed,the thrust structure on is white and the mysterybooster™ structure is painted blue
spacex,not_removed,yeah i think youre right optical illusion looks like combination of center engine compartment that sticks out further than the rest of the octoweb and an outer ring that dips in
spacex,not_removed,the leg attachment points are the ° plates flanking the holddownattachment flanges at and oclock
spacex,not_removed,i believe that was airliner fuselages but im sure theyd take potshots at rockets too
spacex,not_removed,that makes sense thanks
spacex,not_removed,fwiw this is in fact a fh test article source the forum that cannot be named
spacex,not_removed,just have to say this would you mind calling it falcon heavy the official name instead of falcon heavy it just leads to more confusion
spacex,not_removed,why are they doing this on the public street anyway
spacex,not_removed,and heavier from the looks of it
spacex,not_removed,holy cow people its happening a real fh core
spacex,not_removed,the beefier octaweb is a dead giveaway the side boosters can very likely use an iterated version of the existing much lighter octaweb structure with a few addons like the side attachment point the reason i was wary at declaring the centre core from just the beefedup structure was that the boosters likely some degree of reinforcement too they need to transfer merlin worth of thrust to the centre core through two connecting points one at the thrust structure one at the top of the tank and the one at the top of the tank mostly handles the differential moment between the inner and outer merlins trying to twist the booster into the centre core on top of this mostly static load it also likely needs to handle some dynamic load during booster separation where the top connection is broken and the booster cores tipped away for a moment before the lower connection is broken and the boosters separate through a combination of hydraulicpneumatic force separator pistons coldgas thrusters and aerodynamic forces from the boosters being angled away from the core so the thrust structure needs to handle the booster core pivoting about the centre core momentarily and because this is just after booster cutoff this means the thrust structure is handling going from a state where the boosters are pushing the centre core to a situation where the centre core is pulling the boosters
spacex,not_removed,so wait a minute is the lower attachment point for the holddowns or for booster attachment because the lower ones look smaller and thinner than the upper ones it just seems like thats a lot of stress to put on such a comparatively small attachment point
spacex,not_removed,still it sounds vaguely plausible to me
spacex,not_removed,the speculated fh core was on the street wrapped they opened part of the octaweb wrapping briefly and it looked like an employee was checking something inside it then they wrapped it back up it seems like it was on its way in or out and they briefly had to check on something either a forgotten task or the movement schedules just required some particular task be done on the street or its all a big engineered pr leak a hey we are working on things message to us rocket stalkers
spacex,not_removed,two things i think the coloring in the image may just a little deceptive and it is just steel i dont think its painted blue second mysterbooster is unfinished so it probably just hasnt made it to the paint shop yet
spacex,not_removed,its painted white it just has blue and pink markings around it
spacex,not_removed,that dip seems tpo be so the crossbar can be attached directly to the octoweb it will be interesting to see how that comes apart at speed
spacex,not_removed,op just said that the and were core attachments this has been marginally verified edit still stupid
spacex,not_removed,that would explain the lack of engines presumably thats going to be stresstested at mcgregor
spacex,not_removed,mind pming a link to the specific page am forumthatcannotbenamed member
spacex,not_removed,or falcon common people you can count p
spacex,not_removed,some speculate its a pr stunt the stated reason being some lastminute engineering check or lack of space in the factory but the actual reason being to show nasa that the fh is indeed completing some milestones is not vaporware at all and will indeed launch real soon now™ or take your pick among congress ula launch customers spacex fans red dragon customers putin
spacex,not_removed,my guess they arent ready to ship it out yet but they need the factory floor space for new cores
spacex,not_removed,probably shuffling things around to handle the and this was in the way
spacex,not_removed,definitely
spacex,not_removed,it can only be years now
spacex,not_removed,the reason i was wary at declaring the centre core from just the beefedup structure was that the boosters likely some degree of reinforcement too they need to transfer merlin worth of thrust to the centre core through two connecting points one at the thrust structure one at the top of the tank and the one at the top of the tank mostly handles the differential moment between the inner and outer merlins trying to twist the booster into the centre core this really depends on how the load is distributed and i think its going to be structured in a different fashion from how you describe it if as you suggest the octaweb connection points are more like flexible ball joints allowing load to travel up the side booster tank columns then indeed much of the thrust differential is going to transfer over the whole of the side boosters into the upper connection point this is a pretty expensive solution afaics because the center core will be throttled way down to around of full thrust the next engine upgrade is going to lower the throttle limit from the current to so theres an initial thrust differential of about tonsforce being able to throttle down the center core very low is key to being able to utilize the asparagus staging benefits of the triplebooster solution of the falcon heavy so i dont think they are going to limit the thrust differential instead theyll try to drive it up as high as they can the side boosters would require significant strengthening along their whole tank structure a regular tank structure can only take compressive load of the second stage the tank structure near the upper attachment point would have to be significantly strengthened as the center core hangs on it in essence with a tons force on both sides creating significant torque as well and current tank structure is not sized for such huge lateral forces the thrust differential would also have to travel all the way through the center core tank structure this time twice the load of that in a side booster it has to take the full ton differential to allow the side boosters to pull the center core during the initial phase of the ascent this is pretty complex and fragile imho and i think theres a much simpler and much lower mass solution instead transfer all tons of thrust differential via one massive interconnected triple octaweb structure this takes all the extra load off the side boosters and allows them to be essentially carbon copies of a falcon they could conceivably be structured weaker as well because they dont have to carry a second stage but the extra structural margin does not hurt its a margin at the lower part of the tanks the upper connection point would essentially just have to withhold the forces of flexing metal the residual load of rigidity the tripleoctaweb structure is unable to provide and the momentum resulting out of of asymmetric aerodynamic forces of course this solution means the center octaweb has to be beefed up but they are out of steel already and steel is crazy strong the critical point is the attachment point of the octaweb structures it would have to be able to withstand quite a bit of torque how spacex is able to make this both crazy strong crazy rigid yet detachable and totally reusable is a big question besides the tripleoctaweb structure the tank structures would not have to be strengthened for lateral forces which would imo simplify things significantly the center core tank structure would have to be strengthened independently of the load distribution problem the ideal staging size of the falcon heavy upper stage is probably or times the mass of the current upper stage tons that would require a more robust center core tldr i really think transferring all of the differential thrust via the interconnected tripleoctaweb structure would be the correct way to approach it from a total mass perspective concentrate all your troublesome load in a single piece of strong structure and mitigate its effects there which structure should be as small and independent from the rest of your rocket as possible this all is purely speculative though does anyone see any flaws in my arguments or know more about how the falcon heavy is going to distribute the thrust differential
spacex,not_removed,how expensive are gold gas thrusters do they provide high thrust what about isp
spacex,not_removed,they need to transfer merlin worth of thrust to the centre core no since most of the thrust is used just accelerating the boosters to keep up with the center core
spacex,not_removed,is the lower attachment point for the holddowns or for booster attachment because the lower ones look smaller and thinner than the upper ones it just seems like thats a lot of stress to put on such a comparatively small attachment point yes exactly and this is my main point i think the identification of those attachment points in this thread is subtly wrong the double attachment point at the clock position is i think a reinforced holddown point for the center core it has no octaweb structural connection and load transfer load its main role is to hold down the times as strong liftoff thrust of the falcon heavy but the more interesting ones are the four attachment points on the center octaweb for the side booster octawebs they are the weird looking ° elements at the and clock positions theres also two more possible attachment points at and they too could be part of the octaweb interconnections via this bracketed triple octaweb method the three octawebs are connected in a very strong very rigid steel structure that acts as a single virtual octaweb technically turning it into an agapētósweb 😎 able to distribute the tons of differential thrust and gravity differential from the side boosters to the center core protecting the much weaker aluminum alloy tank structures from destructive lateral torque note this interpretation of mine is directly contradicting httpwwwspacexcomfalconheavy on spacexs web site i believe that picture is incomplete the center attachment points of the three octawebs are not the only ones theres four more attachment points up to total or at least thats my highly speculative interpretation of the falcon heavy load distribution structure caveat emptor edit i believe this picture of a is showing the octaweb connection points i speculated about see the thick bracket i think its part of the falcon heavy octaweb load transfer mechanism so perhaps my theory is a bit more than speculation
spacex,not_removed,or its all a big engineered pr leak a hey we are working on things message to us rocket stalkers thats the only explanation that makes sense to me they put the fh stage outside and partly unwrap it at the exact time they can expect photographers around because of the core do you believe in coincidence its a tease
spacex,not_removed,surely this was the core that hit a traffic light and they were unwrapping it at the point of impact to make sure it was ok
spacex,not_removed,he meant that the octaweb is blue
spacex,not_removed,if you look to either side of the attachment points you can see pairs of plates sticking out on either side at a ° angle to the attachment points these are the leg pivots pssst i am the op
spacex,not_removed,one could arrive at ksc with painted on the wrap and the day a rocket launches still tagged is when we know weve hit everyday spaceflight
spacex,not_removed,ooh how about the fun of calling it the falcon and falcon that poor engorgednozzle merlin vac never gets any lovin yes im being deliberately absurd common people i see what you did there
spacex,not_removed,i laughed then frowned
spacex,not_removed,if as you suggest the octaweb connection points are more like flexible ball joints allowing load to travel up the side booster tank columns then indeed much of the thrust differential is going to transfer over the whole of the side boosters into the upper connection point actually i was suggesting the exact opposite that the sideboosters would need strengthened thrust structures like the central core because most of the load would be transferred through them the joint is not a balljoint but a hingepin as can be seen in the images and because of this need for a strengthened structure without being able to confirm the presence of a second attachment point it could not be confirmed whether the core is a centre or side booster from the presence of strengthening alone as for having the linked thrust structures take the moment load as well this would be trickier if you rigidly attach the structures that makes it a lot more difficult to separate them reliably in flight the delta iv heavy for example has the core sit on pins jutting out of the base of the boosters when the booster thrust drops they fall out of the corresponding holes on the core with separation aided by the connecting structure at the top and by coldgas thrusters to prevent the cores hitting each other
spacex,not_removed,far as the trusting i was assuming that they were gonna launch side boosters at then have the center core depending on twr at launch then as acceleration occurs scale back the center core progressively down to the you mentioned
spacex,not_removed,whoops fixed i suppose you could use atomised gold particles in an ion thruster if you really wanted
spacex,not_removed,if they were not connected the boosters would easily outpace the core the boosters are operating at a full throttle without a second stage or payload the core is operating at a significantly reduced throttle with a second stage and payload the connection might not need to transfer the trust of all engines but it would still be a significant portion assuming that the core second stage and payload are and the boosters are each and that each group of engines can produce of thrust at throttle a core throttled to would be producing of thrust acting on the core only this is an oversimplification but it is mostly true this is sufficient to accelerate the core at ignoring gravity the overall vehicle will produce of thrust and have a mass of yielding an overall acceleration of the not provided by the core will be shared by the boosters each providing about acceleration to the core which equates to of force out of the provided by the each engine cluster of merlin worth of thrust as the vehicle climbs the cores burn fuel faster than the core so the portion of the thrust transferred to the core will only increase so is the minimum thrust from each booster that should be transferred to the core yes these are very small values but they assume a full propellant load as the fuel and oxygen are consumed the acceleration would increase dramatically
spacex,not_removed,well the spacex website isnt exactly famous for being updated often what you said seems like it would make a lot of sense one giant structure composed of three strongly joined octawebs would greatly reduce the need for more andor heavier connections elsewhere up the cores and the bottom of of fh seems to fit what you described itll be interesting to see exactly how the attachments work come december hopefully december anyway
spacex,not_removed,or they had to move some cores around inside because of the arrival of which could possibly need temporary storage inside the factory so they needed the fh core outside for a bit and had to move some of the wrapping for the cranes or something
spacex,not_removed,dont believe in coincidence but hanlons razor says dont assume conspiracy
spacex,not_removed,and they just happen to unwrap just enough to prove it seems that its a fh center core all during daylight hours when like you said the rocket paparazzi was already on alert and ready to find something
spacex,not_removed,elon please
spacex,not_removed,seems like a good way to get a bullet hole in the tank if youre just showing off that youre working on your next big vehicle
spacex,not_removed,no traffic light core had engines and was almost certainly
spacex,not_removed,i concede now that i come to the thread and realize you are not a bundle of sticks my bad
spacex,not_removed,we all know elon time by now
spacex,not_removed,actually i was suggesting the exact opposite so the bit i most disagree with is what you wrote here they need to transfer merlin worth of thrust to the centre core through two connecting points one at the thrust structure one at the top of the tank and the one at the top of the tank mostly handles the differential moment between the inner and outer merlins trying to twist the booster into the centre core if the falcon heavy uses a triple octaweb bracket with attachment points towards each side booster attachment points total all detached during side booster separation to create a rigid steel structure then the upper connection point does not have to transfer any differential momentum between outer and inner merlins the whole point of a rigid octaweb structure is to limit much of the load transfer to the steel structure the upper connection point for the side boosters do not have to do much than handle a bit of residual load that are inevitable with a metal structure that is meters long on one arm and only meters on the other but that load is going to be one or two orders of magnitude lower than the differential thrust of the merlin engines structurally the upper connection point will not matter much to thrust load transfer i believe its biggest role is to dampen aerodynamically induced positive feedback loop oscillations that are possible with such w shaped structures if they are left open ended on the upper side so they are turned into an ∞ closed loop structure instead which should be much more stable even if of the thrustgravity load is transferred through the octaweb steel under such a scheme structurally the falcon heavy would probably be able to lift off without the upper connections attached their main role comes later in the flight with increasing air speed do you agree with this analysis
spacex,not_removed,far as the trusting i was assuming that they were gonna launch side boosters at then have the center core depending on twr at launch then as acceleration occurs scale back the center core progressively down to the you mentioned yes theyll balance gravity losses of too low twr against the losses caused by carrying more side booster dry mass plus side booster landing fuel with them to the first meco event my gut feeling is that the upgraded thrust is going to be used in the falcon heavy and that this gives more than enough twr during liftoff to minimize gravity losses theres another reason why it makes sense to aggressively throttle down the center core the has higher isp in vacuum than in atmosphere so the more fuel you can burn at higher altitudes with the center core the more the payload δv
spacex,not_removed,so youre down from merlin worth of thrust to merlin
spacex,not_removed,ok thanks for the clarification
spacex,not_removed,whether the load is carried mainly by the visible hingepin or if there are additional fixed struts in the flat sections flanking it intended to carry lateral load rather than stiffening members to prevent relative roll about the pin in either case the thrust structure is bearing most of the load therefore the side boosters require a similarly strengthened thrust structure to the central core
spacex,not_removed,it is probably in the range of leading up to booster cutoff but immediately after liftoff and core throttledown yes should be the correct ballpark
spacex,not_removed,therefore the side boosters require a similarly strengthened thrust structure to the central core i disagree even in the falcon octaweb theres probably a fair amount of structural reserve for lateral forces because by making an offaxis group of thrust vectors distribute load vertically you inevitably make it strong laterally as well as per my other comments in this thread i think much of the lateral load will be carried by the up to attachment arms connected to the center core the attachment points are the weird looking ° elements at the and clock positions the octawebs of the side boosters have to transfer half the load of the center core the center core octaweb is going to experience the biggest torque about twice as much added by the side boosters
spacex,not_removed,the stiffer the connection between cores are the stiffer the thrust structure itself needs to be in order to avoid bending the more flexible the connection is the more force is borne by the tank skin rather than the thrust structure if the connections are fully rigid then the booster thrust structure is the structure handing the moment force so must handle the bending load
spacex,not_removed,i think you are missing a couple of additional points the momenttorque at the edge of the side boosters is fundamentally lower than the torque at the center of the center core the moment arm is much shorter at the edges reducing torque the side boosters dont have a tons interstage nor a upper stage this gives a more structural strength margin reserve if the plain falcon octaweb is used by cleverly structuring the attachments to the center core the side core octawebs could gain further reductions in torque for example if the attachments are reaching inside the octaweb and are resting against the plate then they could take off the load closer to the octaweb center not creating much extra torque on the side core octaweb plate itself other than what it already has to be able to handle during a falcon liftoff considering these factors no way do the side booster octawebs have to be uniformly thickened like the fh center core octaweb did i manage to convince you that we are looking at the falcon heavy center core 😍
spacex,not_removed,the momenttorque at the edge of the side boosters is fundamentally lower than the torque at the center of the center core the moment arm is much shorter at the edges reducing torque unless something goes horribly wrong eg one side booster shits down earlier than the other the centre core thrust structure should see no bending as an equal force is applied to both sides it is the side boosters that will see a moment around the attachment point the side boosters dont have a tons interstage nor a upper stage this gives a more structural strength margin reserve if the plain falcon octaweb is used in the the load is almost gimballing occurs purely axial with respect to the rocket for the booster there is significant offaxis load which the normal thrust structure is not designed to carry by cleverly structuring the attachments to the center core the side core octawebs could gain further reductions in torque for example if the attachments are reaching inside the octaweb and are resting against the plate then they could take off the load closer to the octaweb center not creating much extra torque on the side core octaweb plate itself other than what it already has to be able to handle during a falcon liftoff do you have a clearer photo of the inside of the thrust structure i am unaware of any loadbearing plate internal to the structure the tvc actuator arms and pintle bearing quadrapod mount to points on the structure lattice and these are where load is transferred from the engines to the thrust structure the main purpose of the structure is to be rigid enough so the tank can sit on top and carry the load straight to the tank walls rather than the tank end cap having to bear any of the load this was the principal reason to move to the octaweb arrangement rather than the grid did i manage to convince you that we are looking at the falcon heavy center core 😍 the presence of a second attachment point opposite the other one convinces me it is a centre core undoubtedly both the centre core and booster cores will require some degree of strengthening to the thrust structure without both a centre and booster core example structures to compare we would have no way to tell from just the presence of increased strengthening whether the core was a booster or central core or to put it another way we know both the booster cores and centre core thrust structures will be stronger than a regular thrust structure we have a core with the stronger thrust structure than a regular we can identify it as a falcon heavy core but without knowing the presence of absence of a second side mount we would not have sufficient information to determine whether it was a side or centre booster because we do not have any way to tell an abitstronger booster structure from an abitmorestronger structure centre
spacex,not_removed,unless something goes horribly wrong eg one side booster shits down earlier than the other the centre core thrust structure should see no bending as an equal force is applied to both sides that is not how momenttorque works the momenttorque applied by the two side boosters is additive in the middle think of a big weight hanging in the middle of a long pole held at two ends and suddenly the two sides are lifted up the pole will bend and the highest torque will be in the middle of it see this httpsenwikipediaorgwikibendingmoment of the distribution of the bending moment the maximum is in the middle do you have a clearer photo of the inside of the thrust structure we have of the falcon heavy octaweb connections see the massive connections arms between the center core and the side cores the two short inner arms are barely visible they connect to the left side octaweb at the position but the longer outer arms that connect the center core to a side booster are clearly visible they attach to the side cores octaweb at a position of ° at and at on the left side core octaweb not very far from the center line of the octaweb plate this moves the extraction point of the torque way inside from the edge of the side core octaweb towards the center of the side core octaweb
spacex,not_removed,it looks like the short arms connecting the side boosters to the core are in fact a thrust structure on the side booster that fits into the notch at the ° degree positions on the fh core octaweb this removes the complexity of an extra arm and decoupling mechanism
spacex,not_removed,do we know how they plan on reusing those outer arms that help attach the boosters octawebs to the center core keeping them on the boosters and folding them up would be a solution but it would be complex and throw off the returning boosters com keeping them on the center core seems like unecessary weight the practical engineer in me says to toss em but thats not spacexs style edit the falcon heavy cgi video seems to keep them on the center core
spacex,not_removed,edit the falcon heavy cgi video seems to keep them on the center core yes that would solve the center of mass problem those arms are not necessarily all that heavy off center mass isnt going to destabilize a tons rocket but i guess they wanted to keep the side cores simple so that they can double as singlestick falcon replacements and most of the falcon heavy complexity in the center core
spacex,not_removed,upvoted
spacex,not_removed,cant wait to have all this officially explained on the webcast
spacex,not_removed,i put them in a for easier viewing hope thats okay edit
spacex,not_removed,you can see the garage door a lot better as well in this one it looks pretty snazzy
spacex,not_removed,im really curious what the apparatus is coming straight down from the top of each piston
spacex,not_removed,do we know the true purpose of this thing i guess the consensus is that it is a way for them to remotely secure the rocket to the deck immediately after landing but i wonder if it isnt also some sort of movable base seems like they could use it to lift the rocket and drive it around or maybe even drive it off of the ship without the need for a crane sort of like the equivalent to an aircraft tug i suppose however that you still need a crane to put the rocket horizontally on a truck for transport just a thought
spacex,not_removed,maybe this is one of the steps to having a truly autonomous drone ship ie no support personal no tug etc would self driving ships be easier than self driving cars and the roomba could be the beginnings of a mobile launchlanding mount for its exciting times
spacex,not_removed,imgur rehost imgur rehost by umechakreidler archiveis archiveis archiveorg google drive by umechakreidler thats a lot of redundancy its not going to disappear anytime soon no need to thank me readers of the future d
spacex,not_removed,i wonder if in a few years we will see boosters for its falcon and others being moved autonomously on the roads of cape from hanger to hanger like normal traffic

spacex,not_removed,is part of securing these for transport to purge the remaining kerosine fuel and purge the gas then pump the tanks with some inert gas if so what are the odds this thing could prevent the need for any work on the barge before beginning transport back to port other than connecting up a tug does anyone know how long it typically takes after landing to get underway back to port i dont know what the connector types are that are used but they must be able to be remotely removed at least since no one unplugs the umbilical manually before launch perhaps they can connect without a person too
spacex,not_removed,like every other piece of equipment i imagined this to be much smaller until i saw it now with people for scale that thing is massive they built a tank to pick up the falcon
spacex,not_removed,this looks almost identical to the system they have for the dragon recovery
spacex,not_removed,since these pictures were taken in sequence from a moving vantage point you have info here the simplest way to see the roomba in is to put adjacent pics sidebyside in reverse order from the original sequence and cross your eyes at the pair with some practice you can get your eyes to lock in on the merged image and focus properly
spacex,not_removed,the roomba could also act as a suspension system reducing forces on the rocket caused by sea conditions potentially increasing the speed the ship can travel to shore
spacex,not_removed,perhaps they will try to land directly on it and therefore eliminate the landing legs save weight and speed up recovery
spacex,not_removed,does it seem seaworthy asdss have had to weather some pretty hairy weather while out at sea how will the roomba i still like hold my beer can stand up to waves of salt water crashing over it
spacex,not_removed,looks amazing its a whole lot more efficient than wielding the legs down the only problem i see is that the possibility of the stage falling right on top of the roomba that would be sad
spacex,not_removed,block is supposed to include updates to the landing legs correct if so if the roomba is interoperable from this older booster to the next generation then either the leg design architecture wont change very much or they will be flying the block legs on this mission thoughts
spacex,not_removed,shouldnt this be heading out tonight or tomorrow
spacex,not_removed,is this the first httpsenwikipediaorgwikidroidrobotastromechdroid droid to be created or would it need to have some level of autonomy before we could call it that
spacex,not_removed,does anyone know if it will be used for tomorrows launch
spacex,not_removed,every hour of labor and piece of material used to recover the stage gets tacked on to the launch price i wonder how this makes that process cheaper maybe the roomba enables processing to begin on the droneship reducing time to reflight
spacex,not_removed,hey guys in my class im writing a paper on spacex can you help me by filling out this short questionaire english german thanks
spacex,not_removed,i cant wait to hear the official names for all of this stuff
spacex,not_removed,could you upload an imgur album
spacex,not_removed,damn thanks a lot i was just about to ask that looks sweet
spacex,not_removed,it can be seen very clearly in your picture above your red mark and also on the arm on the far left that the clamping mechanism consists of a half circle of steel or aluminum that supports from below and a hinged half circle that comes down from above operated by a small horizontal cylinder near the top of the arm the apparatus you have circled appears to be shielded hydraulic cylinders that fold down into a very compact configuration look at the folded arm that is closest to the camera it is immediately below your red circle the sort of pyramidshaped steel is right down on the deck of the roomba with the lower black shields completely hidden the upper shield is shrunk to almost nothing
spacex,not_removed,the shafts passing through the white angular block assembly appear to be jack screws i work on the galaxy cargo plane and we have something very similar built in to the main landing gear the screws or an actuating nut inside the white assembly will rotate causing the assembly to move up or down this style actuator can carry much more load and move in a much more controlled fashion than a traditional piston style actuator heres a picture of the system on a
spacex,not_removed,perhaps an actuator for the clamps since it will likely use the same attachment points as the holding clamps on the launch pad which afaik are driven by gse the roomba will need to have active clamps
spacex,not_removed,i would say thats really unlikely the rocket isnt meant to be very strong laterally and driving along with that small of a base would result in large swings at the top end even on a grade a crane seems like a really stable system
spacex,not_removed,it is probably meant to secure the and maybe shift it to a better position on the deck the middle this would allow them to secure the rocket with fewer personnel and it would be safer as it stands right now there are some people out on the support ships whose job is to get on the asds and secure it in instances where it lands but is in a sketchy state this has been dangerous if it works spacex may be able to reduce the people out on the ships and possibly start the return trip sooner reducing turn around time i doubt it would actually unload the rocket from the ship it is very low ground clearance and cant handle any time on ramp it may speed up the unloading though since once the crane bears most of the weight the clamps could be released with a switch
spacex,not_removed,i suppose however that you still need a crane to put the rocket horizontally on a truck for transport the next logical step is to include a marine transportererector like rig to lay the stage down and transfer it to ground transportation that would allow them to skip the crane which seems pretty labor intensive this little guy could probably move the landed stage to the marine strongback i dont buy the argument that it couldnt move the stage because of structural concerns that seems to be the go to handwavy nonsense statement around here for why something is impossible if it can hold the stage against ocean swells and wind it should have no problem driving it around beyond that perhaps they could have another vessel to transport the stage from the asds to port that way they wouldnt have to tow the asds out and back again for every launch which could save time if they are doing a lot of launches
spacex,not_removed,the more i think about it the more im convinced its an allaround utility robot consider a robot drives out to the stage secures it to the deck upon arrival at the dock it lifts the stage and drives it off the asds with the help of a ramp you then have a mobile service stand to do things like remove the legs etc then with a simple hinge mechanism and winch the stage is placed on a truck for transport considering most of the rockets mass is only a few feet off the ground and the fact you can make that robot super heavy i see no problem with stability driving it around at a few ftmin
spacex,not_removed,seems like they could use it to lift the rocket and drive it around or maybe even drive it off of the ship without the need for a crane thats exactly what im expecting it to do have it drive across a gangplank using the jacks to keep the cg centered then pass the rocket to a mechanism which first grabs it from the top then the bottom and rotates it degrees it would make the operating much more straightforward
spacex,not_removed,thats exactly what my gut feel says theyre testing some kind of proof of concept relating to its landing tech
spacex,not_removed,well truck convoys are presently already capable of keeping formation autonomously with the advances in autonomous driving we might see tests of driverless trucks in the next decade but i wouldnt bet on exceptional loads requiring police escorts to be moved this way any time soon this applies off course only to falcon stages since the diameter of the current iteration of the its booster is way too big at meters
spacex,not_removed,they dont seem particularly wellsuited for traveling any significant distance it seems more likely that theyd only carry the rocket onto the wharf
spacex,not_removed,in a few years we will hopefully start seeing tests of the next step where the booster just landsplugs right back into the launch point as depicted in the its video so therell be a lot less shuttling of boosters around aside from the times theyre taking offline for maintenancerepair of course the total volume of launches may be so much greater by then that therell still be plenty of rocket traffic on those roads so autonomy there still a significant costsaving step
spacex,not_removed,is part of securing these for transport to purge the remaining kerosine fuel and purge the gas then pump the tanks with some inert gas no reason for that isnt dangerous and there isnt much in there there is probably more diesel in the tanks for the engines and generators for the asds itself than there is in the rocket
spacex,not_removed,is that what its going to do just lift just it looks much smaller than the legs of the
spacex,not_removed,they have converted part of the blast wall into a door that opens into an enclosure for the robot to be stored in during transport
spacex,not_removed,this is what gets me how exactly does it get underneath after landing if its aim is to secure until it can be lifted via crane if theyre planning on landing pad clamps to secure mars missions im going to assume they can develop rocketproof mechanical pads which makes me wonder if roomba can catch
spacex,not_removed,in the visual effects world there are photogrammetry tools to create data from video or images like this or autodesk catch or autodesk was working on a tool as was microsoft but i forgot what they were called these arent the only tools and they work much better if you take the pictures with the intent of reconstructing a model perhaps someone with a license of nuke can run this through and see what they can get
spacex,not_removed,cool idea i got it to work with several pairs from that set on winchrome just by opening one of each pair in separate windows minimizing all but those two windows then rtclick taskbar show windows side by side and scroll and zoom until i get both images aligned then cross my eyes until i get stereo lockin its funny the hard eyecrossing makes them look like miniature dioramas with model cars and little toy action figures and hoo boy do i have a headache now you could also animate them into a repeating twoframe backandforth gif and it would look to everyone without squinting
spacex,not_removed,it seems like the jacks they install manually would already do this i think the sole benefit is not having to put crew on deck to secure the rocket for transport saves a little bit of time and cuts risk of serious injury or death to nothing the roomba fixes that problem
spacex,not_removed,falcon is not capable of landing quite this precisely i believe spacex has said so themselves
spacex,not_removed,this would definitely be an improvement if such a system can be built economically ive wondered about a crane system with a flying capture hook that attaches to the top of the stage as it approaches touchdown developing that tech could have applications in other industries as well
spacex,not_removed,falcon is not accurate enough for that and most likely wont be until they can at least figure out hovering
spacex,not_removed,it has a garage
spacex,not_removed,the roomba will be hidden behind the blast wall during landing it only comes out when the stage is landed in one piece
spacex,not_removed,the roomba wont be connecting to the legs so which version that falcon is using will be irrelevant
spacex,not_removed,no idea if its going to have landing leg updates but i dont see why the legs couldnt be updated at any time besides the weight they arent really even critical to the primary mission why would the roomba need to take legs into account unless the height changes by a lot and it would have to be somewhat adjustable anyhow the legs dont play much of a role it grabslifts the octaweb as far as we know
spacex,not_removed,its already gone check the or this httpsredditcomrspacexwikiasds
spacex,not_removed,it probably doesnt make it cheaper but it does make it safer just think of all the effort put into designing and building launch escape systems to reduce the risk for astronauts the lives of the people who secure the stage are worth just as much
spacex,not_removed,every hour of labor and piece of material used to recover the stage gets tacked on to the launch price i wonder how this makes that process cheaper longterm this will reduce the number of hours of labor now a crew doesnt have to board and secure the rocket somebody just drives this thing under it and its done in minutes remotely maybe thats half a dozen employees you dont have to pay to do a dangerous job small steps to catch and secure one rocket asds and optimus prime are a hell of a lot of effort to semiautomate the recovery of dozens of boosters now it starts to make sense
spacex,not_removed,it will save money by making the whole procedure faster if nothing else a day less for the support ships out will save something
spacex,not_removed,still holding out for roombus prime
spacex,not_removed,mawhrinskel is a small droid from the player of games or how about mawhrilsled
spacex,not_removed,im sure everybody at spacex also cant wait to hear
spacex,not_removed,i think everyone will be surprised about the final decision we all know that spacex is full of nerds elon musk is the first of them just days and we will knowmaybe
spacex,not_removed,
spacex,not_removed,tried a couple times but it kept failing with so many will try again adding them one by one
spacex,not_removed,agreed looks like a pitch trim actuator from any plane
spacex,not_removed,this style actuator can carry much more load and move in a much more controlled fashion than a traditional piston style actuator just have to make sure you
spacex,not_removed,the jacks could raise and lower to compensate for a reasonable tilt on the base as long as you move slow enough
spacex,not_removed,it can lay on its side supported at just the its probably strong enough to be moved around slowly by this crawler
spacex,not_removed,perhaps the dock could be outfitted with an offloading platform that could match the height and even bolt up to asds that doesnt sound particularly unfeasible and potentially quicker and easier than cranes whats the current process for bringing the landed boosters back to horizontal
spacex,not_removed,better yet if it can center itself and the booster after landing that means it can align itself to and engage with anchor points on the deck become a single rigid assembly
spacex,not_removed,the problem with a marine te setup is size they would have to move to a much larger ship to have somewhere to fit one on board the idea makes sense on a certain level but for the near future the costs associated with making the drone ship recovery operation more complicated arent worth it stuff like the roomba to me is about getting ready for block where they expect recovery every flight previously if a booster was lost in transit it wasnt critical recovery was still experimental block is going to operate with a planned operational life time from the start
spacex,not_removed,maybe theyll be relying on some sort of static connection such as electromagnets or automated welds to keep the stage vertical while traversing the ocean in that case the roomba would definitely not be able to traverse across a gang plank while i think that the stage could withstand the load of being transported vertically i just dont see the point it isnt like the cranes take an excessive amount of time compared to all of the other processing that is required such as safeing the self destruct mechanism draining the teateb draining the kerosene removing the landing legs and attaching the mounting brackets used for manipulating the stage in the processing facility crane time is minuscule compared to all of that
spacex,not_removed,i agree that the idea of a mobile platform is completely sound thats how the shuttle was moved for decades also up and down an incline i might add
spacex,not_removed,youd have to use an elevator not a ramp tilting the rocket is probably not the best idea
spacex,not_removed,but weve seen no such mechanism that can grapple the top of the stage and gently lay it down horizontally aside from a pair of cranes and the te im pretty sure theyre not going to bring the te all the way over to the port for this
spacex,not_removed,there is probably more diesel in the tanks for the engines and generators for the asds itself than there is in the rocket while undoubtedly true there is a lot of difference in structural strength between a thin aluminium tube and a heavy steel plate tank the nominal landed mass of a booster is tonnes according to hans königsmann and the calculated dry mass is around tonnes so four tonnes of reserve propellant are left with an of ratio of around this gives around of left in the fuel tank at landing
spacex,not_removed,the dangerous part is and lox combining
spacex,not_removed,how exactly does it get underneath after landing by driving under it the legs are quite wide
spacex,not_removed,im trying with zephyr though itll probably produce some garbage because of exactly this they work much better if you take the pictures with the intent of reconstructing a model too far too small too few angles i took photos from this set and it only found some common keypoints in them after cranking reconstruction engine to its absolute maximum it can take several hours so ill update this comment later yup not very useful
spacex,not_removed,thanks my intent was actually just to point out theres a way to see the roomba much more clearly for those who are trying to decipher what theyre looking at in these pics a simple crop and placement of pics sidebyside together with the eyecrossing trick or a stereoscope would do the trick but i dont have the facilities handy to do that very well results on my phone are highly imperfect
spacex,not_removed,yes it can be headacheinducing at first but with enough practice you can learn to relax enough of the muscles to avoid that been doing it about years now and its second nature to me every time i take a picture of some scenery i move the camera to the left a few feet and take another right away so i can look at it in stereo later and yeah things look small like that when the two camera positions are much further apart than your eyes actually are its as if your head has expanded to that size
spacex,not_removed,saves costs and increases flexibility too currently they have the asds a tugboat to take it out and back and a support ship with crew to secure the rocket that support ship is at sea for im guessing days travel each way plus time on station thats a lot of crew resources scheduling just for the task of fastening your rocket down and you need to do it for ocisly jrti and boca chica when that comes online spacex will soon reach a point where theyll need a second drone ship in the atlantic approx week to get the drone out and back will start to bite soon sure theyll alternate with expendable and rtls for a while but eventually theyll need a second drone ship to maintain their launch frequency speculation more drone ships for fh booster recovery too if there isnt the deltav to recover the side boosters on a rtls profile in short they can save a lot of money time and increase flexibility by losing the support ship once prime mover or whatever they call it in the end is working reliably
spacex,not_removed,this is an interesting idea but one hell of a difficult proposition that would certainly be tried on land first and would require something other than tracks for movement the spacex argument has been to learn to have the ability to land on an unvisited and unprepared site
spacex,not_removed,its pretty close to impossible on the ocean
spacex,not_removed,yeah but this thing is a roomba it can compensate for that by moving itself
spacex,not_removed,what if the roomba bot was fast enough to move and orient itself to the landing rocked to capture it
spacex,not_removed,they will not hover theyd have to preserve a lot of fuel to achieve a twr of hovering isnt efficient either its best to land quick and hot to have higher margins
spacex,not_removed,not during the two to four day trip back to port it will be doing its job in the middle of the deck
spacex,not_removed,i understand that but what i meant was that if the rocket fell where the roomba was stored
spacex,not_removed,thank you when the rocket is on the launch pad how many holddown clamps are there three or four if the answer is three then i am confused about why they would holding down the booster on the asds with four points unless it somehow interacts with legs
spacex,not_removed,safer and faster by doing a dirty dangerous repetitive job just what robots are ideal for
spacex,not_removed,also the asds is very slow and might be costly to get the supporting ships so in the future it is possible that spacex will do this like blue origin using a faster autonomous ship instead of hauling barges
spacex,not_removed,i thought wed decided on attitude adjuster
spacex,not_removed,kiss my ass even more appropriate than before
spacex,not_removed,im still in favor of the mnmcsojgpftaatmottsoitattmmsfmvoow mistake not my current state of joshing gentle peevishness for the awesome and terrible majesty of the towering seas of ire that are themselves the mere milquetoast shallows fringing my vast oceans of wrath
spacex,not_removed,im hoping its will eventually launch a dozen giant modules of a new international leocislunar space station just so they can name it so much for subtlety
spacex,not_removed,it doesnt rate a ship name they would have to go for a drone name
spacex,not_removed,i would expect a different naming scheme
spacex,not_removed,so many potentially good names given the heft and colossal strength of this robot id go with no more mr nice guy
spacex,not_removed,the hand of god
spacex,not_removed,going with the theme of player of games wouldnt flereimsaho or mawhrinskel make more sense or that other drone that was friends with of course i still love you
spacex,not_removed,roombimus prime
spacex,not_removed,you are a champion thank you
spacex,not_removed,just studied this the faa was also found to be lacking in its oversight over alaska air probably lead to more faa oversight everywhere
spacex,not_removed,the nasa crawlers do this it would be straight forward for spacex
spacex,not_removed,iirc it is pressurized to improve structural strength when being transported like that
spacex,not_removed,exactly just the ends not just the bottom there is a reason falcon is supported top and bottom during any and all transports even inside the factory not to mention the fact that for most movements the tanks are pressurized to add even more strength this thing is paper thin you can move itvery carefully from just the top like they do to get it off the barge because the bottom can swing freely the stresses dont build up as much but if you lock the base then try to drive it around or on an angle down planks off the barge you are asking for trouble
spacex,not_removed,whats the current process for bringing the landed boosters back to horizontal single crane it from asds to fixed stands on the dock work on it there double crane it from fixed stands to booster transporter working with cranes is not the long pole in the recovery process spacex has a huge amount of experience moving falcon with them boosters usually spend no more than a handful of hours supported by cranes during their nearly weeklong port processing flow
spacex,not_removed,any system would either have only two brief windows of operation a day roughly or require a moving ramp to allow for tide and some wave movement i doubt they want to drive a stage over something like that seems easier to just grab the top and swing it over by crane
spacex,not_removed,that has got to be the correct answer dont know that the anchor points exist yet on the deck but what a great idea to move the roomba to the attach points why weld when you can just insert pins or hook some traps
spacex,not_removed,was thinking the same thing this makes the most sense cranes are about the easiest safest most efficient way to move really large things no one is trying to engineer around a crane here
spacex,not_removed,depending on their plans for refurbishment it may even be economical to land the rocket on a ship large enough for refurbishment at sea just ship it straight back to the launchpad from the port
spacex,not_removed,well in the interest of reducing costs id rather use my company owned custom built robot to do all the logistics work than to rent two cranes and operators every few weeks unless of course spacex owns those cranes
spacex,not_removed,but compare sizes this thing is far too tiny to be a stable moving base for the falcon i also question whether the little treads on here could handle it my vote this thing walked a tight line between being small enough to fit between the legs and under the bells and heavy enough to provide extra stabilization of the stage might be enough to tow it in to port maybe its just enough to make the rocket much safer while crew comes over and rigs a few more permanent chainsbraces definitely dont believe its tough or big or stable enough to move a stage
spacex,not_removed,who says it has to tilt they could easily build a specialized dock for the asds that has the deck perfectly level with the dock surface
spacex,not_removed,in theory a reasonably large pneumatic grabber could be set up to keep the rocket level even as it travels down a ramp
spacex,not_removed,just because we havent seen it doesnt mean that it doesnt exist or is in process of being built
