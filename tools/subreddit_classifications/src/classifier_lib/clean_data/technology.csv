technology,removed,facebook is not recommending shit you only talked about in bars jesus christ get real just because you cant remember searching for that thing earlier doesnt mean facebook is listening to you do you have any idea what incomprehensible volume of data facebook would have to sift through to figure out what youre talking about at any given time even if they could the cost benefit is so monumentally unfavorable they wouldnt bother for fucks sake get a grip on yourself

technology,removed,it doesnt matter how big or small your debts are when you are evicted with no place to live with no utilities and no way to put food on the table youve never been evicted i can tell because there is nowhere in the us that allows you to be evicted for being two weeks late on rent this is not alterable in any landlordtenant agreement lease or otherwise summary eviction immediate eviction with no notice is federally illegal the shortest about of time you have have between being served a notice of eviction and actually being a nonresident of the property is hours unless a crome is committed nonpayment of rent is not a crime youve also never had your utilities shut off or if you have you at no point called your utility company utility companies arent allowed to shut off necessary utilities power water and sewer in all states gas in most states north of texas for quite some time a month is the shortest ive seen so long as theyre informed that a payment is intended and that the address has residents also utility companies are federally barred from being selective about who they do business with so there is literally no longterm penalty to shutting off your power for a spell so really if youre so fucked that youre being evicted or your utilities are being shut off no payday loan shop in the world would approve a loan of an amount that would make a dent in your situation furthermore if youre hungry pasta costs pennies a serving soup costs pennies a serving nobodys going to approve your five dollar payday loan and furthermore if you are at the point where you cannot scrape together a dollar in change to buy a box of pasta then a payday loan is not going to help you its only going to prolong your suffering bankruptcy is your only option at that point youve never declared bankruptcy either bankruptcy isnt a magic get out of jail free card for your utilities and rent bankruptcy forgives some or all of your debts at the cost of your credit score and any assets you still owe money on that the court thinks you can live without in most states this is all of them bankruptcy is for debt not ongoing obligations and in fact while it will dismiss all rent claims against you rent will immediately begin accumulating against you again and you may be evicted so no bankruptcy isnt even an option at that point at least pay day loans give people a chance to stave off bankruptcy a bit longer and maybe avoid it again this is such a wrongheaded idea that i legitimately consider it strong evidence that your only experience with bankruptcy comes from severe misrepresentations in tv and films ahh those multinational companies must be forcing people to take these loans against will since you believe that it is not their own fault that they are taking out these loans you yourself have described it as a last resort if its a last resort and is literally a monetary boobytrap then yes its a really clever trap its peoples fault that they took it out have you read any of my other posts but they only did so because they dont know not to you cannot legitimately fault someone for not being educated especially in a country where of the education most people get is government run and funded thats the governments fault and thats as cut and dried as these things get no that is not the governments job it is not their job to stop people from making their own bad choices right thats not at all what i said like it directly contradicts it please start responding to my posts or ill stop responding at all

technology,removed,i did some googling to see what the current performance level is for these things i didnt find anything particularly conclusive but heres a simple cheap retail model that can do license plates per second thats per minute i would assume that governments have access to far better equipment so a thousand per minute doesnt seem completely impossible however im not sure what sort of traffic patterns would result in cars passing a camera every minute maybe at the daytona still its definitely not a police car because the police said it wasnt perhaps you should read the linked article its definitely a shady attempt by some local government department because of the attempted camouflage police and other departments using license plate readers have no reason to hide
technology,removed,what part of that makes you think google knew about this or rolled over sounds to me like google found out along with everyone else and are crafting a statementchecking with their lawyers about how to move forward
technology,removed,does anyone ever feel like the natives should all rise up together so that they can finally be put down like the dogs they are why do they get to have their own land anyway my family even tried to buy it but they keep cock blocking us
technology,removed,what i meant by social protection was protection from abuse because in a society there are consequences for acting horribly and disrupting others whereas online there are not you cannot deny that people abusing the right or speech and anonymity fuck it up for the majority way outside of their actual numbers they are so disruptive and due to those protections unaccountable that they ruin things for everyone else

technology,removed,more space junk for mindless entertainment
technology,removed,id rather make sure everyone has food and shelter and some quality of life than spend shitloads on a partybut thats somehow wrong to say since it ruins the fun i wish more people were less self centered
technology,removed,a cloudy night sky could be a problem but starale said the space display can be called off at least minutes prior to the launch this feature will give the party organizers time to reschedule the entertainment when the sky is clearer it will also ensure that they get their moneys worth
technology,removed,this is a ridiculous argument often used to try and flip this issue its like when people say you bought a sandwich and that money could feed someone in africa for a month it tries to divert the blame onto someone getting lunch from where it actually lies with the people who dont every help others and do more than one thing with their means
technology,removed,occasionally partaking in a book is nothing at all like spending millions on a few minutes of ooh pretty personally i spend more helping than i do on myself but most people dont help at all you can try and turn it around on me for buying a book instead of putting it on the people who choose large excess but it doesnt really work except in the minds of those who get offended at the thought of their money being used for anything but themselves
technology,removed,well germany is currently in the role of babysitter of finance responsible person on a drunk shopping spree in the eu right now so i cant imagine they are very happy about any huge uiiowooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooa
technology,removed,yeah and i dont believe in firing american workers and bringing in wet back slave labor to replace them protects a countrys people either and least union workers pay federal taxes and contribute their income back into their communities while wet back labor sends whatever pittance they earn back to their own home countries
technology,removed,unreal
technology,removed,then you are either one of the talented ones we actually want and would like to come here at equal pay or you are one of the shit leeches that are only here because your companies have been able to pay you a lower salary for sponsoring you which is it both exist but one is more common than the other which is why people are sensitive to the subject we have to deal with the more common case in our jobs
technology,removed,without telling the employer i was on dude if you were around the dot com bubble and had an accent they basically can assume you were not telling them doesnt really buy you much even now if you are a younger person here with a heavy accent its pretty easy to guess how you got here its not a given but its also not a wrong guess and it shakes out because they are absolutely allowed to ask you if you need sponsorship
technology,removed,well you are technically stealing our jobs fuck you cunt of a human
technology,removed,if recruiters are rejecting you then you might want to look inside yourself instead of others generally means you cant communicate accent or your credentials look like a shitpile i think its ignorant not to say several things when you hear an accent there are these things called communications skills and a significant accent inhibits those which many employers find as a negative then there is the fact it also means you may not have been in the us very long which even on is going to disqualify you from a metric shit ton of jobs just because there is a high probability you arent a us citizen or permanent resident then especially if you are going through a recruiter contracts are more likely and none of them want to fuck with an for a temp position unless the contractor is sponsoring how about you stop being so racist
technology,removed,id be able to assess your shit leech level pretty quickly if i had you in person and based on your attitude i assume you would fall into shit leech with an accent since you are so defensive about your talent and your accent let me guess you think object pooling if the answer to all questions because you heard about it once in some java class
technology,removed,does it smell
technology,removed,cheap gas it looks faggy yeha its dumb reason but its a reason lack or urbanisation hear me out a major advantage of hybrids over say just a regular small car is that they can recapture energy from breaking as electricity in inner city areas this is hella useful but in the us where theres less density more open highways this doesnt benefit people much
technology,removed,really my entire post history is hillary propaganda illiteracy confirmed
technology,removed,apparently its ok to poke fun at low income people people who scream they tuk r jawrbs and call them racists and tell them they are doing work other americans wont do but when it comes to higher income skilled workers losing their jobs to foreign workers then its outrageous ha why do any of you think its ok to import an underclass pay them below minimum wage or below union standards make them work in a shitty environment without overtime without health benefits why do you guys seem to think its ok to use people up and then kick them to the curb because they come here illegally and then say americans wont do these jobs just because this is happening to higher skilled workers with these visas doesnt mean it hasnt been happening to lower skilled jobs with illegal immigration
technology,removed,i really want to be sarcastic in this thread but i think we have too many hypocrites that would just down vote regardless of the point i was trying to make secret its not really a secret us companies have been doing this for a long time especially with low skilled positions think of agriculture farm labor animal husbandry construction and fast food us companies fire american workers hire illegal immigrants for pennies on the dollar and then work them into the ground they get paid below minimum wage or union pay standards they get virtually no benefits no overtime and no workers protection they literally take positions away from other americans due to how artificially cheap they make labor and yet most of what i hear is just liberals shitting on the people complaining about the issue this is not an issue about race this is an issue about keeping costs down and doing it anyway we can most of you seem to think its ok to have illegals doing these shit and dangerous jobs for little pay just so you can buy your cabbage for but somehow its not ok for companies to replace your high skilled jobs

technology,removed,you are really struggling with wrapping your around the basic flaw in adhominems arguments arent you there is a reason they are the first thing they cover in intro to logic courses because ignorant people think there is a correlation between the point someone is making and their character jesus im afraid you entire frontal lobe really has been fried by cnns demagoguery

technology,removed,truly i actually really enjoyed writing the reviews i went from writing small little ones into more complicated video reviews at some point it became very time consuming and i justified the time spent making video reviews by the discounts but it sucked when people accused me of being biased i think i honestly responded to someone dude i just made a minute edited review video of a friggin ice cube tray i didnt do it to save

technology,removed,the silicon valley investors and the billion in vc funding is being used to artificially price out competition to hopefully create a monopoly if you had to hail cab there is a real world market value for each mile driven so for example lets say each mile cost to cover maintenance insurance tnc permits airport fees driver pay medical etc uber is subsidizing riders cost by for each mile while also gouging drivers by taking more on the commission end the avg driver will stick with uberlyft for months or less and so uber needs to always recruit new drivers to keep the their product flooded with new drivers through sign up bonuses or nobody in their right mind would do this job ubers goal is to eventually springboard off the backs of drivers giving customers an false sense of cheap and affordable transportation the biggest hurdle now that uber faces is that theyre trying to test their self driving autonomous fleet but now have been placed into a category of a commercial transportation company instead of a ride sharing software company why being labeled a commercial transportation company the overhead on each car is extremely expensive and more so than trains and buses if uber is able to win a war against competition in theory they would become a monopoly and then start increasing prices to recoup the billions in losses without consumers being none the wiser so i wouldnt be expecting self driving cars to be any cheaper then the prices right now if not more expensive because uber has basically created a financial mess that put themselves into a billion dollar home with a business model that is not sustainable while giving consumers a false sense of affordability this is all being done at the same time with the theory that silicon valley billionaires can just throw money at any venture without the product having real market value dictated by customers actual purchases to create roi created a price that is fictional without knowing what the future will bring they are setting up a scenario where if they were able to win monopoly they will be inflating prices to make sure they get three to four times their return from the billion dollar investment im not sure about most people but this type of innovation seems financially irresponsible since their workforce is not a dedicated workforce transportation ebs and flows like water with unpredictability the best way for evil to succeed with their business model is to do one of two things increase riders fares on the subsidies and also lower their commission rates can make real world income there is an amazing fivepart series written by harvard economics graduate that explains how the word predatory monopoly project is both a danger to consumers along with the social welfare of exploiting their drivers consumers i would be warned dont think to have a false sense of security when or if companies like uber create a monopoly monopolies were designed to create financial foundations to exploit the population

technology,removed,then they wouldnt have gotten away with it for long now would they are you joking because they did have logs and they knew about it and they covered it up the fault had been known to gm for at least a decade prior to the recall being declared because they are not open sourced logs that anyone can obtain which is the issue here company keeps logs releases logs to public when it benefits them tesla or keeps them private if it damages them gm the issue isnt the logs its whos keeping and controlling the data

technology,removed,more on fake news and the damage its doing how teens in the balkans are duping trump supporters with fake news more than protrump websites being run from a single town in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia as facebook regularly reveals in earnings reports a us facebook user is worth about four times a user outside the us the fractionofapennyperclick of us display advertising — a declining market for american publishers — goes a long way in veles several teens and young men who run these sites told buzzfeed news that they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their politics stories to spread on facebook — and the best way to generate shares on facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to trump supporters yes the info in the blogs is bad false and misleading but the rationale is that if it gets the people to click on it and engage then use it said a university student in veles who started a us politics site and who agreed to speak on the condition that buzzfeed news not use his name i started the site for a easy way to make money said a who runs a site with four other people in macedonia the economy is very weak and teenagers are not allowed to work so we need to find creative ways to make some money im a musician but i cant afford music gear here in macedonia the revenue from a small site is enough to afford many things most of the posts on these sites are aggregated or completely plagiarized from fringe and rightwing sites in the us the macedonians see a story elsewhere write a sensationalized headline and quickly post it to their site then they share it on facebook to try and generate traffic the more people who click through from facebook the more money they earn from ads on their website buzzfeed news research also found that the most successful stories from these sites were nearly all false or misleading four of the five most successful posts from the macedonian sites buzzfeed news identified are false they include the false claim that the pope endorsed trump and the false claim that mike pence said michelle obama is the most vulgar first lady weve ever had those four posts together generated more than million shares reactions and comments on facebook that resulted in huge traffic and significant ad revenue for the owners of these sites with many people being misinformed along the way the macedonians buzzfeed news spoke to said the explosion in protrump sites in veles means the market has now become crowded making it harder to earn money the people who launched their sites early in are making the most money according to the university student he said a friend of his earns per month or even per day when he gets a hit on facebook the young men running these sites know the trump traffic bonanza will soon come to an end they expect traffic and revenue to decline significantly once the election is over but they also hold out hope that a trump win will keep their sites afloat httpswwwbuzzfeedcomcraigsilvermanhowmacedoniabecameaglobalhubforprotrumpmisinfo on reddit the facebook nearbillionaire secretly funding trumps meme machine the told

president of the group on its website its something that no campaign is going to run luckey said of the proposed billboards for the project ive got plenty of money luckey added money is not my issue i thought it sounded like a real jolly good time but in another post written under luckeys reddit pseudonym there are echoes of a similar tech billionaire peter thiel who used his deep pockets to secretly fund a campaign against gawker before becoming directly involved in the process luckey met the man who would serve as the liaison for the nascent political action group and provide legitimacy to a reddit audience for later donations without having to reveal luckeys identity breitbart tech editor and trump booster milo yiannopoulos the bleachedblonde political agitator is most notable for being permanently suspended from twitter for harassment after a series of abusive messages to actress leslie jones luckey first met the altright provocateur in los angeles about a year and a half ago before yiannopoulos began working on a charity to send white men to college the daily beast later reported that the scholarship fund had resulted in zero financial distribution of the donations that had been made directly to yiannopouloss bank account i came into touch with them over facebook luckey said of the band of trolls behind the operation it went along the lines of hey i have a bunch of

technology,removed,i agree that the shift in political discourse has gotten much nastier and that the violence is outrageous from all sides conservative and liberal the shift in political discourse has gotten nastier because the politicians have become more obscene in their offenses and so the peoples grievances have become more pointed there is a real feeling perfectly warranted that neither partys candidates with very few exceptions actually supports or represents the will of the people so they have this kind of unfocused rage and the watercarrying media tells us we should be directing at either person a while person b is a saint or vice versa so people follow along media is powerful just look at this sub that is stuck on zomg russian pee hooker spy mole with a little dash of lol libtards pizzagate for balance imo this is a failure of media to accurately question political actors and provide transparency the utter laziness of the media is destroying the country alternative media does provide a bit of relief but they dont have the megaphone cnn and fox and msnbc do
technology,removed,i spent a lot of time writing this and it doesnt appear to be showing up in the comments ill try one more time as a top level comment what the tpp actually does and why i did a couple hours of research a few months ago the best i could come up with from neutral sources was what i put below read all of the bullet points though because i didnt neatly separate this list into pros and cons if you even can it is an absurdly complicated subject so take everything with a grain of salt it would be like nafta was for mexico us canada but with a few major differences the first major difference is that instead of targeting trade with mexico the point was to target trade with south east asia the second major difference was that nafta targeted manufacturing jobs in return for cheaper goods tpp targeted service level jobs and was very explicit in which industries for which countries for example for the united states jobs in nursing and retail work were specifically targeted and expected to be strongly adversely affected in return for significantly expanded asian market penetration for things like american automotive exports and pharmaceuticals how could something like nursing be exported well that actually gets to the heart of the matter for the united states the point of the tpp and its sister acts was to greatly greatly strengthen and enforce ip law for south east asia to match already existing ip and trade law in the us and europe so whereas right now your bank probably hires american programmers instead of programmers from cambodia for purely safety and enforcement reasons that would change tomorrow and with the tpp if you are a programmer this would adversely affect you but nursing was specifically targeted as bringing se asia more in line with hipaa guarantees would make it legally feasible to outsource more hospital overhead offshore this all means you could expect major offshoring of what are right now considered reputable and secure jobs in america and for the act to be quite transformative for the economy in short if your job isnt tied to the usa and is easy to offshore but hasnt been for logistic legal or economic reasons the tpp almost certainly changed the math involved with that equation though of course it will be different for every job industry okay so if america is trading away good jobs in entire industries what does it get in return right now if you are a large business that wants to get into asian markets you have two problems if you open in china theres a good chance your designs will be eventually be stolen and given to a chinese company which the chinese government will then later support at your expense and the rest of se asia has similar problems to varying degrees and they all trade with china additionally right now europes economy is looking dead for the foreseeable future and since america isnt spending money jumpstarting our own economy were not likely to grow at a large rate any time soon either but asian economies are booming and as they do so they are trading with each other and making trade deals with each other that dont include us and thats a major disadvantage for america and europe so the purpose of the tpp from a western viewpoint is to get se asia into the same economic and legal framework as the western world and open their markets to western companies the second purpose of the tpp is to get china to play ball too right now if we tell china to open their markets and enforce western ip law theyll laugh in our face and do so we dont have the bartering chips for that deal but if the rest of se asia is already doing so with the west and builds their economies around such laws then years from now it wont just be europe usa telling china to open their markets and enforce international ip law it will be the vast majority of chinas trading partners in short it would be an economic coup detat for western powers that would bring a lot of money to large western companies and give washington much more power in asia if you are a citizen of the west this is almost certainly a good thing so obama and clintons bet is that if we dont make a deal like the tpp then chinese and by extension se asian companies are going to spring up as international competitors to american firms anyway and that increased competition represents lost profits that could otherwise have been made by western companies trading in china so by trading those jobs to outsourcing now the us would be in a much more dominant position later and it is worth the trade okay is that line of thinking valid yes and no if you are a ceo or a powerful washington person then yes unequivocally the tpp means continued western and american worldwide economic hegemony and should be strongly fought for eu usa firms cannot do business in china thats a major economic disadvantage for any western firm playing on that level for people whos jobs are not offshored then yes this is probably a good plan just like nafta resulted in cheaper goods tpp should result in cheaper services across the board but if your job can be offshored and the list of offshorable jobs the tpp will make cost effective to offshore is large then it is more complicated if the usa had a real economic safety net and put forward programs towards retraining and revitalizing areas specifically hit by offshoring and globalization then you could vote for the tpp confidently this for example is how the scandanavian countries handled integration into the eu and overall there are very few cases of real economic hardship as the result of that integration overall it was a success story but after nafta the usa implemented no such programs whatsoever economists at the time believed them to be unnecessary the thinking was that if free trade agreements resulted in more trade which resulted in more jobs then people who lost their jobs to outsourcing should have no difficulty finding new jobs in a free market the reality was that outsourcing resulted in chain effects whereby entire regions of the country lost all their good jobs and the good jobs that remained moved to other us locations combined with the fact that many people woke up one day to find that their entire career was no longer employable in their home country meant that they simply could not find new work add in again greenspans attempts to lower worker mobility to increase american labor competitiveness and the end result is that today in many families that lost their jobs due to nafta still are not employed so at the end of the day you have to make a call do you think that america will be like scandanavia and reinvest a portion of the profits reaped by greater access to asian markets on economic growth unemployment benefits worker retraining and government programs or do you think that america will call those things socialism ignore the problem and allow large companies to reap the economic rewards unmolested personally i fall into the second category so i am very very happy to see the tpp fail i think that given the second viewpoint outsourcing service level jobs in this economy would be a death sentence for many many people but that said if you think that the first option is a possibility then the tpp should be strongly supported and really in an ideal world if we could trust that america would take care of the people who would be harmed by the outsourcing then we would want the tpp to pass because increased trade and american competitiveness in the future is something that should be encouraged and worked towards

technology,removed,yes this is the reason why so many people use a second account and would put a bid on their own item as soon as they start selling something i use ebay quite a lot if you really want a great item at a cheaper price bidding right away is the stupidest thing you can do its in your best interest as a buyer to keep the interest in certain items as low as possible i would even say that putting items on you watch list and visiting them often giving them clicks is decreasing your chance of getting that item for cheap find something that you want to buy set an alarm on your phone and bid in the last second using the app its the only way that works ill give you an example with a new still sealed xiaomi action cam that i just bought for bucks or more times less than the actual cost its a relatively unknown brand its not famous for making action cams but i take it from youtube reviews its actually quite satisfying it stayed without any bids the whole time which is fantastic i bet in the last second and one other person bet had i bid bucks or days before the end i can assure you the item would have sold for the best thing that can happen to you on ebay is finding a valuable item that for some reason doesnt get the corresponding interest like an expensive bicycle put in the wrong category with no description and misspelling on the title and the seller doesnt use a second account or ask his friends with ebay accounts to inflate the price with bids thats the ebay jackpot

technology,removed,youre right but i dont think my lack of consideration for that factor is for no reason we will be adding selfdriving semis to our highways and selfflipping burgers to our restaurant reasonably soon but it will very likely be a long time before a our skilled workforce is displaced by automation the question at hand as i understand it is what to do in the interim that doesnt even begin to account for the fact that many of our supply bottlenecks arent efficiency based but environmentally based were draining lakes aquifers oil wells and rareearth element mines faster than ever and automation isnt posed to replenish nature in the near term

technology,removed,fuck off shill
technology,removed,its from the illinois gop in with what looks to a few hundred emails from unused and defunct email accounts thats not the rnc the states political system was hacked through what is considered to be foreign involvement the wording suggests that no one is sure how it occured all those sources in there are hearsay anyway its all the wp reported the nytimes suggests yawn
technology,removed,see about what your original point that the rnc was hacked it wasnt well at least to the point that one cant prove a negative
technology,removed,if you trust modern encryption then i can tell you a couple interesting facts about the bitcoin network it is the largest supercomputer ever built in terms of computational power and it uses this computational power to leverage modern cryptographic standards along with a nifty consensus protocol to mean that bitcoin is quite literally the least hackable network that has ever been created there has never been a system as secure as bitcoin in any technical sense the things you dont trust are all of the services built around this network the exchanges the dark markets the people running investment scam projects built around the technology etc and youre correct to do so but none of these things have anything to do with the technology that is bitcoin itself i dont expect to you to understand but thats where the other guys analogy about the internet is apt people didnt understand why the www or email was useful in at least the vast majority didnt in the late people thought it was insane to trust paypal with financial information and buy things over a computer these things seemed completely foreign because they were and we didnt yet understand all of the cool things that would be built on top of infrastructure like email and online shopping bitcoin or more specifically the data structure underlying it called a blockchain is potentially another one of those things the idea of a computer program that nobody is in charge of nobody owns but everybody trusts because you know exactly how it works is a very new and strange idea its natural to not trust it yet the cool things that will be built on these decentralized systems arent here yet so its hard to imagine them right now much like ebay couldve existed years before it did but it didnt much like myspace couldve existed years before it did but it didnt it takes time the innovative idea behind the blockchain and distributed consensus has opened up a new type of infrastructure for exchanging and verifying information using the most power computational network on earth the real potential imo is in areas of automating and removing human influence from a whole new swathe of systems that we right now assume need humans involved in them the idea of a music or video publishing company that acts as a middle man between a musician or filmmaker and the customers might be a completely outdated idea because of systems that can be built on a blockchain services like western union that facilitate transfer of funds between countries could be obsolete because a distributed blockchain can do that without any humans or companies involved and cut costs for the enduser by while doing it this elimination of middlemen is just some of the most obvious ideas in this new technology we have barely begun to scratch the surface on innovation in this branch of decentralized computer networks if you want me to rant about more neat ideas for why blockchains might be here to stay let me know

technology,removed,when i first learned about social networks and other online communications services i thought the idea was to allow the people to communicate to each other without any filters censoring communication it seemed like services like facebook were going to adopt the landline telephone model where you can communicate whatever you want to whoever you want but now it seems that both governments and large corporations are moving into the censorship business the crafting of central narratives that intellectuals like noam chomsky warned about in the and in regards to cable news and old style newspapers is going to look like childs play compared to what is coming in the digital world

technology,removed,i havent heard anyone clanking this certainly no one i consider credible otoh im not sure what being liberal or conservative has to do with digital data security if obama said what trump said id be calling him ignorant too the real problem is that are ignorant not stupid just ignorant but they dont let that stop them from making ignorant proclamations that make them look stupid to the people that actually have some knowledge in the field and know better as ive said in other comments it is relatively difficult to get right and the consequences of messing something up just once require a significant amount of effort to get secured again it should not be this way it would not be that difficult to automate almost all of this but no one cares our at least they havent card maybe they will start caring now

technology,removed,without going into too much detail were a server provider for voip programs we host thousands of servers many of our clients are people who play video games although some use these programs for business purposes each of these servers can have multiple users up to on each server in some cases so with that many people connecting to our services the probability of a ddos attack is higher especially when your main users are gamers some are younger and will hold grudges against their community an example is if they were banned from the server or got into an argument with a fellow member so to get back at their community they will send a ddos attack most of the time using these network stressers not knowing that we have mitigation in place theyre wasting their money but sometimes it can cause issues if were getting hit with multiple attacks at once or if it is a larger attack than normal of course the gaming industry has users that range vastly in age these can be done by anyone regardless of how petty it is it happens more often then youd think
technology,removed,the waterproof thing is a joke anyways its a pointless feature that of all customers will never use but for some reasons of them think its worth having what they should emphasize is rain resistance imo with the headphone jack on the bottom come back with a small internal battery and a larger external battery that you can hot swap thicken the phone a bit for batterysimmemory expansion dont rush it out the door keep other same specs as note they would recover in a few years

technology,removed,i was told the free market would keep that from happening
technology,removed,antitrust
technology,removed,i agree its better to analyze the technique before more controversial incidents occur particularly when precedents are being set that portion of the debate seems perfectly reasonable to me especially put as well as you did it would be nice to see guidance issued on what techniques can be used in what circumstances and who can approve the measures im fairly confident in dallas the decision to strap a bomb to a robot wasnt a causal call from a fieldcop but theres no telling who might copy the technique in the future personally i think its a bit sensational to be nervous were still well within the realm of individuals in law enforcement deciding to utilize lethal measures its fairly immaterial whether a particular technology is employed im sure many people thought the advent of guns made killing impersonal and would lead to a constant state of massmurder but i dont see anyone suggesting police carry swords the bottom line is the police need to stay ahead of those trying to kill them its not pleasant and never has been until the robot is autonomous however i think were splitting hairs my confusion and sentiment stem from what i perceive to be a general disregard for individual responsibility accountability especially after incidents like these and an increasingly extreme disparity in expectations with regard to law enforcement i hold law enforcement to a much higher standard than average citizens but i dont believe theyre paid to die every time someone cracks active shooters should be the most cutanddry situation for the use of lethal force whatever the form i dont mean to suggest i support extrajudicial summary executions by the police but its important recognize that theyre humans too and dont deserve to have their safety considered less important particularly than than massmurderers
technology,removed,youre the reason this country is descending into a world shit hole fuck you
technology,removed,and if the cops killed the guy before finding out where the bombs were or were on a timed trigger or something but they killed him anyway because of this precedent would you feel just as comfortable
technology,removed,november mosul iraq second platoon was called to and entered a residence not knowing whats inside in the end we lost two pfc alcozer during the initial firefight and sf msg yost when he led a squad of iraqi soldiers back in the residence was rigged to blow and it did you never know what is going to happen when you enter a building or anything whoever made the decision in dallas did so most likely for the safety of the officers that would have needed to go in risk losing officers in a place with suppose bombs or just blow it to save lives
technology,removed,i dont understand how youre distinguishing what is and isnt an immediate threat if theyd sacrificed three more officers would the threat have become immediate if he shot and killed a police sniper what if a swat team was blown up while trying to reach him by a bomb which he said he planted in the parking garage and in the streets with the intent of killing them what if someone not with the police was hiding out since the shootout began and tried to escape and was killed would the threat become immediate again how many secondsminutes have to pass in between murders and attempted murders for his status resets from immediate threat to nonimmediate threat based on the situation and communication with the individual it was very reasonable to act on his persistent immediate threat
technology,removed,youre absolutely right and the police tried to use minimum force through negotiation and containment from the evidence available so far it appears that attempt resulted in the murder of the officer and threats to blow up more if this were armed combat soldiers would be calling for friendly snipers or air support to neutralize the threat without question
technology,removed,

technology,removed,yeah your sharing economy is about ubers venture investors sharing the profits they earned from you and the other suckers who drove for them pretty sure the whole idea of the sharing economy was to share your wallets contents until its empty fcking ridiculous that you would think allowing a company that makes no money to destroy an industry that employs tens of thousands of working class people who would like better jobs actually probably more for no social gain is good
technology,removed,why univision is buying it if theyre just going to shut it down
technology,removed,story of my life my company has gone through several acquisitions and uses salesforce for everything only many of the companies have their own set of standards and we were way too lax about allowing new companies to just follow their existing procedures so now were left with data so bad that nobody could even give us an exact number of how many customers we have or how many products weve sold you know the basics
technology,removed,so what no seriously so what this is yet another battery breakthrough that well never see on the store shelves
technology,removed,i charge when it needs it since my phone power draw is near nil when i sleep i typically wait until its or lower and i have an hour to spare if i only charged at night by the next night i have a potentially low battery and that isnt ideal
technology,removed,that equates to vehicle fire for every million miles driven compared to fire in over million miles for tesla you comment about cars catching fire are probably years old tells me you dont even know nor have you looked at any data on it and what does cost have to do with anything shall i show you lambos and ferraris that catch fire all the time and even right off the lot

technology,removed,well it all depends on what run means dotnet core lets you share compiled code across windows linux and osx platforms python really only lets you execute python code across platforms so when you say python runs anywhere you are saying that you can run python code anywhere so for example python cant really run on android unless you use pythonforandroid or kivy so yeah the language can be made to run on those platforms but its not actually python a fairer comparison would be to another language and c does run in android raspberry pi and ios

technology,removed,facepalm feel free to provide actual arguments instead of being too scared for it europe has much more competition in isps which is why isps have much less power europe has more competition indeed and that is one of the reasons for less power per isp but net neutrality laws have most certainly restricted their power way more than competition ever could we have direct evidence of the effects of net neutrality introduced in specific member nations as previously isps despite the competition had severe throttling or even blocking of certain services especially those competing with their own sms and voice services such as whatsapp and skype with net neutrality this was no longer allowed and recently europe passed a very strong euwide net neutrality and everyone is better off go ahead and provide evidence to the contrary

technology,removed,i wouldnt give the government access it would certainly run through the company they are an additional check to make sure warrants are valid on top of the many other legaltechnicalinstitutional checks we have already for search warrants or could include specifically for encryption warrants this most likely not what the various government agencies are interested in theyre interested in a way for local and federal offices to easily get access to an encrypted phone as going through a private entity to get access to investigatorily highly relevant information is slow complicated and most likely overregulated le perspective so now you implement a way for the phone encryption to be broken lets say they go with a way into the cloud backup as compromising device security itself is guaranteed to go badly how long do you think its going to be until the tune changes from we need a way in to this is too cumbersome and apple is being obstructionist we should have direct atwill access imo taking the first step here is already too much once theres a way in the ideological battle is lost and the door to more and more aggressive erosion of phone security is open as such a hardline stance against compromising is the logical thing to do here imo

technology,removed,great echo chamber algorithm youve got there
technology,removed,facebook is really useful for staying connected and organizing events i check it every day but by check it i mean i log in and if there are no notifications or messages i log right back out its not bad enough that i would just stop using it if i didnt use it i would actually miss out on a tonne of social things and little jokes from my friends i just dont like stuff or post often it is what you make it
technology,removed,arsteschnicacom floods facebook feed with stories
technology,removed,okay serious answer i log in to facebook every day but by that i mean i log in and if there are no messages or notifications then i usually log back out i dont spend time on there like i do with reddit its a tool mostly its used for events my social group makes house parties or whatever and invite people so its heavily for that were organizing paintball at the moment so the event page is very useful what day and time suits attending is good for bbqs or food related so people know how much food we need and who is bringing what none of this hits the public feed other than is attending the event you are secondly its good for adding people i meet at parties add me on facebook means its possible i can add them to an event and maybe start building a friendship if i like them most people have facebook i think not having it puts you at a disadvantage socially messenger is good for large group messages the last one i got was like people and someone was asking if one of us had a light saber they could borrow organised dinner a couple weeks back and let the other people know that table was booked for what time and where and we could all see who had seen the message otherwise i dont use it for oneonone but some people do a couple of my friends tag me in funny pictures so i usually like that tag to show ive seen it i very rarely post on my page i dont like many things by all means im a private person but facebook is what you make it most of my closer friends i have on snapchat i dont scroll through the feed feeling envy of other peoples lives i dont read news there dont click on articles dont comment on peoples stuff its all optional so i do what works for me and then log out

technology,removed,quick bit of reddit history for you all srs ran a sub for harassing reddits advertisers an spamming the inboxes of media outlets this was back in when they waged a blatant and successful campaign to attack reddit and its money backers so that the leadership would ban the jailbait subreddit that the admins said broke no rules the sub they ran it out of still exists today and lists contact info for media reporters and journalists when other groups and subs in later years tried to do the same thing for their causes and wanted to contact journalist and the media reddits founders personally intervened to shut it down and to halt their campaigns they let srs harass journalist and attack others that didnt go along with their campaign but when the gamergate subs tried to do the same thing they shut that whole thing down i would link the srs sub that they ran their operation out of but i dont want to get in trouble the admins might think im encouraging brigading of a dead six yearold sub thats reddit leadership for you

technology,removed,this is a private company making a decision about its userbase how widelyused or popular does reddit need to be before it is considered a public utility or a public good what about facebook what about twitter what about google or other search engines should they be censoring or manipulating content that they deem wrong or offensive just because they can and because they can say that theyre a private company there was a time when telephones were operated and run by private companies what if you want to use the phone to talk about beliefs that the phone company leadership or owners dont like if they found out about it could they kick you off of their service and cut your phone line what about email if google or yahoo find out youre talking about something that while legal to talk about is disgusting to them or unacceptable could they then kick you off of their email services massive companies that may be privately held and operated are used by so many people that they may very well be de facto public commodities or services should they have the moral or even legal right to censor content or obstruct behavior that their shareholders or ownership disapproves of just because they feel like it how does antitrust law come into play if at all
technology,removed,the srs people are referring to has been dead for a looooooong time because they and their friends took over more than half of reddits subreddits through mod positions meaning that instead of brigading and arguing like srs used to do they could just ban you if you said something in their various subs if they dont like what you say theyre irrelevant as old srs because new srs just took dozens of subs over and shut everything down that they dont like maybe you werent aware of that

technology,removed,theyre literally taking quotes from sjws and replacing white or man with an alternative i figured you were a racism apologist but i was expecting better than that
technology,removed,while i get what youre saying regarding the cost of developing maintaining and supporting the app i dont agree that it should cost anything note im not saying that the fee or cost is fair or right its definitely too high compared to the small costs of developing the app and supporting it the only justification i could maybe see would be if roku was hitting comcast with fees on the backend to include the app in its software stores but i doubt that cable tv is almost commercial time as it is not disputing that hence why i havent had cable in years im already paying an arm and a leg to use the service i dont really understand your argument on this point ive read it multiple times when i pay to use an app like netflix on roku im paying to use the netflix service i can watch on any platform i choose because i already pay to use the service my argument is that the article was misleading the article literally said that comcast users may be in for a rude surprise and then went on to say that people will be informed of the charges and will have to optin which one is it comcast being sneaky bastards or comcast letting people decide i dont disagree that the cost is too high objectively versus alternatives or probably shouldnt be charged subjectively because comcast sucks and overcharges for everything only that this article is misleading they should be adding features to help entice cord cutters to come back to using their platform not trying to push them away with more fees most already have a roku device and no fees could make some people return sadly they are doing this but with negative reinforcement i suspect the goal is not to get people back onto comcast tv it is to get people off of the roku devices who are already used to using comcast tv the article didnt talk about any of that though just the surprise fee as if people who dont read options presented to them by apps will actually read their bills in an alternate universe where i agree with bullshit fees i could see it being worth that would have to include access for all my roku devices in the house still too high imo their supportdevelopment burden would be basically the same whether i have or in my house support burden no development burden yes supporting highvolume users costs more than occasional users not that that justifies it just saying there should probably be no fee this is just a trick intended to try to get people to not utilize one device that levels the playing field between comcast and netflix etc

technology,removed,i never said you have to hate apple but based on what you wrote you gotta take your head out of your ass seriously
technology,removed,usbc drive works just like a thumb drive cant see why it would be any different that is a thumb drive you massive doofus
technology,removed,do you not think that microsoft have really got themselves together recently the surface pro is a brilliant machine as far as i can see the surface book looks superb and the recent promotion for the microsoft surface studio looks like a great machine
technology,removed,there most certainly is a need for name calling when you undermine your own argument
technology,removed,i never had an hdmi port on mine i had to use an adaptor
technology,removed,so you want it repairable or light and are quite modular laptops
technology,removed,i dont want to jump on the apple hate bandwagon but im confused as to what you mean by underpowered the gpu is in every way better than the one in the imac and i cant think of any inferior specs it has when compared with the imac
technology,removed,i work it in a lab manager position at a college campus basically i tell my employees what to do and occasionally i have to deal with someones problem like not being able to connect to the wifi or troubleshooting software for a class the average dumbdumb clicks on everything and i mean everything you know that obnoxious banner ad that says free tv with the flashing multicolor lights purposely designed to trigger a seizure that you ignore out of habit they see the word free and click on it ive seen windows laptops with a celeron running processes in task manager with nothing open the record for my virus scanner is detected objects i literally had a girl last week come in that gave money to people running a ransomware scan she called the fucking number and gave the indian dude that answered money to unlock her pc then finally decided to come talk to me people are stupid with computers that includes young and old and they do not give a shit you try explaining to them hey run maleware bytes like once a week it should be okay and you shouldnt have any problems and you see their eyes glaze over while they ignore everything you say and instead think of the chad thundercock they would like to fuck later that night its incredibly frustrating
technology,removed,not to mention the laggy input in word
technology,removed,so brave
technology,removed,yes literally any competitively priced laptops and as a bonus youll most likely get superior hardware and wont need any adapters
technology,removed,im more at the consumer end of these companies that a pro user like you but i like to splash out and get the best version of whatever product despite the cost so i have a pro and have ditched my plans to upgrade my ipad the problem is i have poor impulse control fairly deep pockets and two children that only get to watch a limited amount of movies strict wife so i tend to switch on the apple tv and just buy them a movie every saturday and sunday as a treat so at least they are up with the new stuff coming out this means i have a huge itunes movie library i know i can continue to use itunes but i hate it but i like apple tv but i want to switch to microsoft what a tough life i have
technology,removed,🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
technology,removed,ok this is one of these either you care or you dont i am not a photographer so i have honestly never used the sd slot so to me this is not a big deal it is not a big deal as its hard to argue that you need the sd slot for everyone because only of your user base has cameras and depend on the sd slot obviously a made up number i can totally see why they killed it off it makes sense in the whole were killing everything old thing they got going on killed usb hdmi etc of all the things i am ok with them killing its the sd card slot it is not too much to ask the user to have a dongle for this we are apparently ok with no dvd br network etc but at the sd slot is where we draw the line nah i understand it and though it really doesnt matter to me i think this is one of the things that is acceptable for apple to drop the damn price low end specs and maxing out at and charging for it thats pissing me off and is driving me back towards a windows machine again
technology,removed,there is no way to directly connect the iphone to a mbp the question is why do we need a cable at all i understand for charging the damn thing but arent we supposed to connect the iphone wirelessly these days
technology,removed,adding a touch display above the physical keys would be another thing right i am looking at my mbp i have plenty of room for the damn touch display above the keys already
technology,removed,that actually encapsulate exactly how i feel about this compromise compromise no one wants it
technology,removed,then to remove your own peripheral lightning port wait yours has a lightning port
technology,removed,ipad pro is still for consumption not creation
technology,removed,look this argument is a bit stupid connect your camera direct wirelessly or use a dongle its not a beallendall issue it sucks to have something you relied on removed fine but of all the things they killed off that one matters the least and no one would completely switch platform just because they need a dongle
technology,removed,i think the mbp actually only represents like of their sales or something its not that big of a revenue driver at apple
technology,removed,everyone i see with a macbook pro is some hipster at starbucks which then in your mind represents the majority of mac users wanna come over to our it lab here ill show you our programmers security people sysadmins and content creators there be no hipsters here
technology,removed,well i dont know why people still care about apple we dont we just want a good laptop couldnt give a fuck about tim and his gang of blue shirted hipsters and i think thats the problem they think way to highly of themselves
technology,removed,yep pretty bad to write colleagues kept coming in so in the end i just went with what id got down ill leave my shame for the world to see
technology,removed,bitch im and i fuck your fat wife when youre not around hows that for patronizing
technology,removed,id be laughing if i wasnt crying from being an apple user
technology,removed,no you fucking idiot the wacom cintiq has had a parallax problem ever since it came to market and even the latest version doesnt significantly improve on this the ipad pro is like drawing on paper when you just rest a wacom pen on the cintiq screen nothing happens but when you rest a ipad pro pen which is actually lighter than a wacom pen you get input the ipad pro has way better sensitivity get fucking educated

technology,removed,how is broken its certainly not a clean upgrade from but a fresh install works fine its certainly intrusive but that is the unfortunate intended functionality
technology,removed,even with the emails and the latest of those coming because of weiner you still believe this do you actually believe the lies or are you just a useful idiot
technology,removed,but no one said fugitive criminal and criminal is defined by having done a crime which he did before megaupload long before lots of crime so pd he is a criminal
technology,removed,musk didnt want to build hyperloop he just suggested it as a way forward
technology,removed,i had the same concern decided to give pia a try and it seems to be working fine getting down for and it makes my ip look like im using another isp
technology,removed,couldnt there be some way to tap into opentracker like an api and get all magnet links that exist on every site
technology,removed,i recall reading about a study which found that women were turned on by a wider variety or porn including hetero samesex group animals cartoon etc etc whereas men were much more specific wonder how theyll control for that
technology,removed,it still makes him pd a criminal and i have no idea where the fuck you all get your definitions from
technology,removed,the definition of criminal is not bound to country why it should be it is a term that is not relevant for any legal process it is just a definition someone who was convicted of a crime is a criminal and he was convicted of a crime so he is a criminal
technology,removed,good work lou

technology,removed,new frequency i dont think you realize how things work the government has already reclaimed and sold off the range and very soon will be reclaiming the range to sell to the highest bidder like phone companies problem with this is there is a shit ton of stuff already using the range myself i have almost in wireless microphones in that range i had and had to sell them all off years ago for a major loss fuck having to do that again everything from tv stations to radio stations to types of remote controls to garage door openers to everything you can imagine use particular frequencies to work yet the government is basically fuck you people want faster wifi to facebook with
technology,removed,there are a ton of nokia fans out there that have settled for other things since their demiseespecially outside of the usa i would love a nokia android phone and hope they deliver
technology,removed,vote trump
technology,removed,yeah its near the end the intercept asked fullman if he or mara had ever heard of — or been involved in — discussions about overthrowing or assassinating bainimarama far from denying it he said that sort of talk happened frequently within fijian prodemocracy circles however he said it was just angry ranting when the alcohol was flowing something completely different from real plans people would say things like please can we just hire the americans to send one drone to fiji to get rid of those bastards or let me go back to fiji and ill just get a knife and stab him fullman said its venting its our way of maintaining sanity — we just sit and bitch about everything we dont want violence we want something where theres control a planned approach more to the effect where its the people who protest and say enough is enough this is wrong we want to go back to the old constitution and have elections

technology,removed,slight correction the trouble in kashmir began after the indian government rigged elections in late
technology,removed,this gave rush limbaugh and other rightwing talk hosts control of many markets squeezing out the few progressive shows that had been on the air i miss what was lost
technology,removed,the reason is it runs better uses fewer resources and is easy to manage personally i dont give a shit what you use though
technology,removed,they got some publicity out of it
technology,removed,its worth noting that of facebooks ad revenue comes from mobile ads predominantly via the app unless you only access via a browser youre not really much of a problem

technology,removed,didnt network security folks secretly appreciate lulzsec hacking rampages back in the day because it made people much more aware that their security was terrible
technology,removed,these are totally separate products a car and a bigass truck both use some kind of engine but you dont say that theyre the exact same thing except a vehicle a usb webcam and a networkconnected ip security camera both use some type of camera they can all be called cameras much like a passenger car and a commercial transport truck can be called vehicles you probably have a usb webcam theyre designed for chatting like you experienced they connect to a computer using a usb cable theyre nothing more than basically a camera and wiring to connect to your computer they dont have much internal logic to them that runs without a computer attached ip cameras are designed for operation independent of your computer the basically have a small computer inside them this small computer runs a web server or other various servers that let you connect directly to the camera without having a computer between them theyre directly connected to the network which means anyone that can talk on the network can talk to the cameras so the need a username and password usb webcams rely on security present on your own computer again they dont have internal logic to them really theres no way for something to request a password from you when it has no logic to do so being that the webcam is meant to be used intermittently while youre sitting in front of it this isnt a problem the article is talking about an ip camera not a webcam two very different things your phone may have a camera as well but that doesnt mean we automatically group it into the same category as webcams or ip cameras although the risk of someone maliciously using your phones camera or mic is something you should probably be concerned with if this is the type of article to scare you when you set up an ip camera generally you open the browser on a computer and go to the ip cameras settings page where you modify the settings this is where the password would be changed on a webcam no such thing exists because well it doesnt exist a webcam is only a camera connected to a computer its not an independently operating device again meaning the computer itself is responsible for its settings generally many people think they can directly connect their ip cameras to talk to the internet and they leave access wide open for everyone who wants to see it they never change the default password or set up any security rules to make it so only the owner can talk to the ip camera and see what it sees with a webcam youd have to find some third party software running on the computer with the webcam connected that takes the place of the internal software on an ip camera they can do similar things like vehicles both type can get you from a to b but they differ in approach complexity and requirements the common factor exhibited in the article is that the average consumer is not aware enough to set up any security on any kind of computer or network device
technology,removed,check out the book hacker hoaxer whistleblower spy the many faces of anonymous by enid gabriella coleman the chapter on lulzsec notes many security experts i interviewed directly cited lulzsecs role in making highlevel executives heed their messages at least for a short while saw a string of massive data breaches adobe target neiman marcus livingsocial the washington state administrative office of the courts evernote drupalorg the us federal reserve okcupid the list goes on a blog post by security researcher and journalist patrick gray entitled why we secretly love lulzsec was widely read among security professionals and captured their prevailing mood he explained to me the impact of his piece it picked up more buzz than anything id ever written including pieces for zdnetcnet the sydney morning herald the age wired ive written plenty of news stories that went big globally but this was something entirely different in the piece gray wrote it might be surprising to external observers but security professionals are also secretly getting a kick out of watching these guys go nuts the mainstrem media are having fun criticizing sony for its poor security but do we honestly think for a second that the xbox live network cant be similarly pwnt i know the psn breach hasnt been pinned on lulzsec but
technology,removed,im convinced i could talk him into killing himself
technology,removed,thats simply not how it works though without complete authority over international nodes and the ability to overcome any and all encryption it would be unenforceable without total blackout i cant imagine how you could do it its important to note as well that while vpns are popular because they are baked into winapple they are simply one of many ways to communicate securely online
technology,removed,why do you give a shit about corporate tax rates you a fuckin shill

technology,removed,you get more artists musicians and creatives until the whole society starts running out of food then kommissar realizes that youre the problem and your music and art and science papers dont contribute to the things that feed people and keep people warm that youre taking from ubi but not contributing to ubi then youre forced into a farming labor camp until youre shot in the back of the head for being a starving skeleton thats not farming hard enough thats what people are ignoring from the why work if i have ubi thing doesnt matter if its true communism or not when people stop working you stop having food factories etc then once everyones starving by the millions the more time to focus on creative and scientific pursuits of noble knowledge who advocated for ubi are usually the first to go just like what happened with the intellectual socialists in russia

technology,removed,black powder is also not an explosive it is flammable like the liquid fuels we burn now
technology,removed,or admiral
technology,removed,hey now without zuckerberg rtrashy probably wouldnt exist
technology,removed,bigly
technology,removed,people are being really unfair to zuckerberg in this thread the guy donates a lot of money to charities and has philanthropic ventures hes trying to bring internet access to the third world built a hospital in sf pushes for new technology is a great leader and a very savvy businessman you may not like facebook because its the cool new thing yet you all use it but i dont think that mark is a bad guy at all
technology,removed,because no one bothers to investigate how he got into it how do you get into as face and then sell it years later for the amount how do you do the same with paypal i feel everyday more and more that elon is ciainteligence agent and his companies are fronts like many others cia shills over over public sector is nothing new do your research people stop listening to every cunt on internet without verifying facts
technology,removed,using that lax of a definition of explosive means pretty much anything that burns could be considered an explosive when talking about explosives in the context of a comparison to flammable material the distinction is better made drawing the line at detonation
technology,removed,zukerberk could be gates prodigy they are copy of one another gates is the reaches person in the world for how many decades and what has he done with his money ill tell you what him and clinton did they made africa depended on them every month instead of creating a cure theyve created a pill to treat symptoms of hiv and malaria geee i wonder why i guess because thats what pharma does in usa and they are heavily invested in those sectors people you fucking morons do your fucking research it takes an hour at most and few google keywords
technology,removed,ooh so my single page hello world website is technology it connects to db to store last time anyone logged in wow what a great technology huh moron
technology,removed,no you stupid snowflake hillary supporter reason why trump has won is because smartacting people are tired of being bullshitted too dumb morons like yourself see elon on big bang theory and cum in your own mouth out of excitement get his dick away from his face its blocking your vision

technology,removed,if youre just going to be salty thats a tremendous comeback you really have the best words
technology,removed,im not surprised that its been over hyped
technology,removed,its ok because humans can overcome anything with their ingenuity
technology,removed,honestly it doesnt matter software wise both os are capable of meeting all your standard computer needs buy whatever you prefer if youve come to love apple software and their whole ecosystem id say stick with mbp if you dont mind exploring a new operating system and the learning curve that goes with it then switch to pc the gap between mac vs pc has narrowed to a point where you really arent missing much choosing one over the other
technology,removed,the point is that you are out of the house and you have no control over it if something goes wrong if you get in a car crash and get knocked unconscious or your phone gets smashed you might come home to find it and your cat in ashes is it really that hard for you to think up the possible scenarios that could end badly most modern ovens dont even take minutes to heat up anyway
technology,removed,how much of an issue is compatibility when im browsing the web for siftwsre i can be pretty sure that almost all applications will have a windows version most will have a mac version cant say ive seen many for linux has that been a problem for you
technology,removed,if you want to use the adult version of fisher price then stick with a mac if you want to join the rest of the men in the real world use a pc
technology,removed,thank you for sharing with us
technology,removed,wow its working
technology,removed,rofl this company is getting shittier and shittier day by day im surprise they dont realize that what they are doing is turning their customers away even the fan boysgirls
technology,removed,lets see if ive got this right theyve removed the power extension cable for the charger added the branding to the screen bezel removed the function row keys useful to many software engineers if not many others and muscle memory beats having to look for a specific key removed all of the useful ports consequently forcing most users to resort to using adapters and cables to do anything from using a usb pen drive to charging an apple smart phone made the mistake of not aligning the new virtual escape key so that it sits in the same position it used to considerably reduced the size of the battery limited customers to a maximum of of ram used the gen intel chipset instead of the latest gen substantially increased the cost hmmm i was hoping to upgrade from my first gen mbp retina this year its a fantastic laptop and so i was quite excited about this release theyve taken two years to produce this update and boy oh boy is it a disappointment bad form apple
technology,removed,there are a variety of reasons its not so much less effort being spent on optimization as developers are using toolkits that make programing easier and faster at the expense of efficiency its a market necessity these days because technology changes so rapidly average companies cant afford to spend a year developing a single application also the data being worked with is growing web browsers are reasonably efficient but web pages are growing into fullfledge applications being downloaded from the internet and stored in memory which itself is a memory inefficient method of downloading and running applications but is very convenient and secure for endusers
technology,removed,found the hillary shill
technology,removed,a secretive startup based in california me too what a coincidence i am also a secretive venture set to take on tesla i wont tell you anything about my current state of development but if you want to invest then by all means
technology,removed,i mean
technology,removed,hey i know what we should do for the next mbp for even more battery life lets replace the processor with intel pentium from the and while were at it lets get rid of the retina display and bring back the battery will practically last for ever can i work at apple now
technology,removed,apples goal is making the perfect laptop a heavy laptop that doesnt sit comfortably with you or in your bag isnt perfect not to mention battery life is still good unless you are using resource intensive programs a power user would bring a charger regardless of battery size for normal use the battery does not need to last longer than a day
technology,removed,or you know one post was made two hours before the other one posting a comment hours after a post has been made doesnt always have the time to become visible
technology,removed,of course it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that its non userupgradeable besides you can always buy the new model years from now
technology,removed,i did and this is obviously spam because its all you post fuck off
technology,removed,right and i agree but im saying it takes time to catch up to a comment that was posted over an hour before and hours after the post started so absent of the good answer there was only the other one to up vote so people did its how reddit works makes sense good
technology,removed,im sorry simple concepts confuse you thats unfortunate
technology,removed,maybe because you are comparing a topoftheline fullfledged laptop to a tabletnotebook that is also much more reasonably priced for what youre getting
technology,removed,that was very intentional
technology,removed,you mean a business wants money no way they make a superior product nobody wants to pay more for these adapters but everybody will because they want an iphone get used to it
technology,removed,he may just be an apple shill google the astroturfing megathread itll really open your eyes to how much latent advertising and discreet shill jobs go on on reddit
technology,removed,very true

technology,removed,this article is painful levels of click bait for anyone who doesnt want to waste their time reading it it mentions barbies for a paragraph god knows why you would connect one to your wifi network actually why would you what possible advantage could connecting that to a network afford it completely overlooks the issue that almost all of these vulnerabilities only come about because either a people do not configure their home networks correctly or b the manufacturer fucked up with stupid default credentials changing the passwords or properly utilising a router solves all these issues also turn off upnp

technology,removed,you people are absolutely hilarious go ahead and downvote me like it matters the reason we took the white house is because you still dont get it and you dont get it because you dont even try to get it there is a difference between an illegal immigrant and an immgriant likewise its completely separate to be a refuge from an immigrant you want a stack overflow reddit analogy imagine letting anyone make reddit accounts fine now imagine they start shitting all over the place with spam accounts with racist posts with stalking accounts that arent respecting the rules of the community youd want to remove those accounts right sorry now youre a xenophobic shitbag theres nothing wrong with having a standard of expectations for people immigrating into your country and nothing wrong with getting rid of people who refuse to follow those rules there is no debate you either follow the law or you dont if you buy a gun illegally you dont get to claim im just a gun immigrant and keep your guns if you drive your car illegally without a license and insurance you dont get to keep your car and a temporary ban on important refuges from muslim countries known to be vectors for terrorism youd have to be insane to equate that to something like internment camps these people still have countries they can go to in fact if you let go of your white savior complex youd realize there are tons of countries for which these people can go to which share their values culture and familiar legal systems so to imply the usa is literally the best place for random refugees is literally racism how dare you assume the usa is the greatest country in the world and they would be better off here thats nationalism talk might as well throw a white robe on and burn down some churches see how insane that sounds when you use hardcore liberal logic on other topics or against itself
technology,removed,there may be other areas where visas are used to import cheap labor large tech companies are not among them what are you kidding do you work in the industry ive worked at tech firms and am currently working for a swedish multinational and im brown i know people who have been replaced by and they had to train these fucking idiots to take their jobs ive overheard them speaking amongst themselves in their native hindi which i understand how this is their first project and that theyre nervous completely unqualified bullshitted their resume and now theyre here taking away jobs from americans because theyll work for as consultants without benefits your statement is absolute bullshit

technology,removed,do they laud their diversity at the same time because they usually are both connected
technology,removed,that fact that you think it does is your weird issue my weird issue is why are they put in the title of the article at all to equate them with the people who died what if they had parakeets in a cage or a ferret running around loose would they be mentioned too
technology,removed,because i dont believe a fucking word of it thats why i havent had a virus in almost years either but never infected with some kind of malware bullfuckingshit but hey if you dont like my attitude theres always the block user list use it if you have to
technology,removed,i think its tragic enough without mentioning the cats in the title articles used to only mention it maybe at the end of an article not as part of a headline it adds extra poignancy to the death of the people ah clickbait for cat lovers gotcha
technology,removed,i wonder why they dont give a shit about all those people they just laid off
technology,removed,im the owner of sociopathcommunitycom come find me lol

technology,removed,how can the same be said for a taxi they dont have to ask you to pay them in cash you just do therefore you wouldnt know if they were breaking the law
technology,removed,youre full of shit
technology,removed,hmmm i see what your saying haha forgive me its been a while since i used a taxi i still think it would easier to do in a taxi uber would get suspicious if you were transporting a person then canceled it
technology,removed,nah havent you heard its not hatred when you you hate people who are hateful or who you think are hateful
technology,removed,hello thedonald poster spewing bullshit i know youre frustrated a post of your fellow comrades failed to hit the front page today but thats no reason to try and flood other subreddit with your everybody hates us agenda the fact your little safe space is still up and running is a living proof youre not being oppressed thanks
technology,removed,said the person who wrote in another subreddit classy
technology,removed,yeah but this aint good taxiuber driver as their salaries go down
technology,removed,it was the article was deleted
technology,removed,more money will flow to the drivers once the old method is trashed nope taxi system reduces the amount of drivers out there this keeps prices high apps enable direct driver client access how is anyone going to be able to make enough for living prices are too low and there are too many people willing to give ride for few bucks so in the end you are going to make more money by working at local grocery shop
technology,removed,it is kinda sad how people dont give a shit about taxiuber drivers only thing that people seem to care about is how cheap it is for them it doesnt seem to matter if taxiuber driver is making any money himself

technology,removed,it shouldnt be up to apple to force the issue its not apple every consumer electronics company outside of apple every luxury car brand every major appliance manufacturer has always required a certified ie trained repair technician why the fuck are you singing out apple that is the issue that really is the issue isnt it apple is taking the heat for what every major manufacturer has done since the dawn of time it should be up to the cosumer if they trust the kiosks or not is is up to the consumer you are totally free to fuck yourself by taking your expensive personal electronics device to omars fly by night cell phone cart in the mall and have them fuck your device up no one has taken that away from you just stop being the self entitled whining cunt that expects every company to disgorge all their trade secrets to satisfy your grossly immature belief that your needs come above all else and on top of that they should be free to try themselves or let a friend etc they are free to do that go do it go do it right now if youre not doing it than thats on you not them ive fixed hundreds of apple devices without the advent of schematics and im not even certified that which was beyond my capability was taken back to apple or replaced thats the real world get the fuck over it already it should be their call not apples youre a fucking moron

technology,removed,you dont think le is smart enough to notice things like that following money and movements of money right before events etc is pretty common as far as i know it would be very suspicious still

technology,removed,oh so youre one of those who thinks people shouldnt be allowed to open up laptops or things they buy or attempt to repair them since they dont have the right to repair things they own right no not at all i open all the things warranty be damned i just dont delude myself into thinking that every manufacturer owes me anything beyond what came in the box and is covered by the warranty you have to be a part of apples club that follows a specific pricing scale and charges outrageous amounts for simple fixes this is misinformed bullshit that you have yet to prove get out of the echo chamber and find some real facts this is about independent people individuals who just want to fix their equipment and cant solely because apple makes it so that their equipment is damn near impossible to repair this is complete bullshit ive never worked on an ipad but ive fixed countless mac laptops and phones and i know when a certain repair is beyond the knowledge or toolset i have at my disposal there is nothing about apples design or policy that keeps people from repairing anything you either have what you need or you dont if you dont thats in no way apples fault get the right tools or the right knowledge or right training or fuck off so that they can charge outrageous amounts for the fixes they decide that only they can provide youre in the echo chamber again people who paid to fix their busted ipad did so because they completely trashed their product so much so that it had to be replaced with a new unit i manage over macs and none of the repairs of which there have been less than cost anywhere close to the amounts being bandied around this sub laptop screens are the most expensive item and i get replacements from ebay and do the exchange myself and im not apple authorized why am i talking about apple in the comments of an article about apple ummnn the article singles out apple when its the entire industry that requires trained and authorized repair technicians are you really that dishonest that you cant acknowledge that sorry to tell you that a friend of mine got schematics from toshiba to repair his laptop yeah some reverse engineered part schematic toshiba does not sell schematics for their laptops and they also require toshiba authorized repair centers to do work on their products i dont have the technical experience to repair electronics to that extent so i never tried but my friend certainly does and he certainly succeeded with the repair good on him i do do this sort of thing for a living and have done so for almost years the vast majority of the world doesnt do component level repairs on computing equipment doing the diagnostic requires not only a lot of expensive equipment but in most cases required vendor specific equipment to get to that level people who are working on motherboards with oscilloscopes and logic analyzers are wasting their clients time its cheaper to just replace the assembly than pay for the diagnostic time furthermore apple actively takes down anyone who publishes schematics from their products apple this apple that im a whiny cunt that can only see what apple does and it offends me so does every other manufacturer and yet for a modest fee go find an official schematic to a dell motherboard or a samsung phone they simply do not exist because the schematic relates the entire design which is a trade secret youre asking for companies to invest billions in development then give it all away so china can flood the market with clones are you too fucking stupid to see that i also found plenty of websites with schematics from plenty of manufacturers and the only ones i found from apple were paid awww fuck right off now you want it all for free i suppose you want a blowjob and million dollars with that as well first you claim that you cant get it when its obviously available from third parties who knows whether its complete or accurate which matters a lot then too cheap a cunt to pay for it fuck everything about you and your immature argument i hope life kicks you extra hard when you realize that this whole movement is unreasonable also sorry to inform you that you can obtain schematics on vehicles from the manufacturers oh really give me a link to a schematic to a ferrari to lexus id love to take a look theyll probably ask you if youre a mechanic and you might have to fill a request form or something of the sort or require that you become an authorized repair technician i had just finished watching a repair video for a dead touchpadkeyboard you mean the one where that all you whiny cunts are complaining arent available the official repair quotes were according to him its in his best business interest to bash apple im not buying for a second that the resistor he replaced magically went from ohms to some resistance that simply does not happen also you sound rather angry with all the insults am i offending your cult or something no i just dont like lying social justice warriors im not championing him i defend his right to repair equipment he purchased or which people paid him to repair which isnt even under any sort of threat so what is there to defend no one is trying to stop him from doing what he does i wouldnt be surprised if he isnt sued for using stolen documentation though i defend the right that if an equipment i own no longer functions properly i can open it up and try and fix it and just how did you manage to delude yourself that anyone is trying to stop that i also find it very interesting that youre angry at people for trying a cheaper way to fix their electronics im not angry for people trying to fix their electronics im angry at all the self entitled cunts that think that the world owes them something far beyond what they paid for why the fuck arent you angry at microsoft for not releasing the source for their buggy piece of shit operating system its the exact same principal how dare they not pay for a new resistance how dare they dont put words in my mouth i never eluded to any such thing not only that but you dont even want people opening their own electronics youre a fucking idiot i could give fuckall what people do with their own devices you want to plod ahead uninformed go right ahead so he should bow down to apple and start charging outrageous amounts for the repairs he does as well show me where is says that certified techs have to charge a certain fee you cant because they dont its another lie fuck your personal opinion and your morals do as apple tells you again youre a fucking idiot and have little grasp of reality if you think a resistor burning out isnt going to interfere with complex and delicate electronics i dont even know what to tell you you havent the slightest fucking clue what youre talking about a zero ohm resistor burning out isnt the problem itself its a symptom of a larger problem if something ran so much current through that resistor to change its value then something else is horribly wrong that he failed to fix im calling bullshit on this actually being the case because in order to get the current up that high to cause a failure the voltage would have to have been so high as to fry the traces on the motherboard its basic ohms law his disassembling and reassembling the laptop and is likely what fixed it changing that resistor likely did nothing i doubt you ever even took basic electronics classes though ive been a practicing electronics engineer for over years if you dont even consider the amount of problems a single resistance failing can lead to youre way out of your league donnie
technology,removed,people complaining about astroturfers is what bothers me the most
technology,removed,i say make the mods status a democracy per say if there are x amount of modabuse reports within y period of time that mod loses their mod rights for z amount of time and its all automated and will not be overridden with politics a mod being a dick get people to report that mod through some process once that threshold is hit action is automatically taken adds some checks and balances to the system the users should never fear the mods the mods should fear the users
technology,removed,well i mean anyone with entry level programming experience could make a competing application look at reddit as a whole the coreuseful features of the site its not a complicated system they may have made it complicated but the core functionality isnt difficult to reproduce getting it to scale to the traffic will require some knowledgeable sysadmins but if you already have a solid framework you could make a reddit clone yourself with the core features in months tops you just need to decide what features are important for release though i mean the idea of categorizing posts with a maximum of level deep of categories the ability to create new categories user registration posting content that you dont host some basic mod features this is technology

technology,removed,this would be a great tool for english learners
technology,removed,they also have a httpsfoxtypecomsentencetree for sentences
technology,removed,well speaking from a frontend user only no idea what the backend looks like id imagine something along the lines of when a mod is reported a case is opened and associated with the subreddit the report originated from in order to add your report to the case you must be a subscriber of that subreddit and your subscription date must be before the timestamp of the creation date of the case must have x amount of karma enough to not have a captcha anymore a verified email address maybe the act of reporting a mod sends a temp link to the accounts email address that must be clicked on in order to finalize the report just shooting from the hip there im sure a more talented dev could think of something better
technology,removed,coontown is literally right there when you google voat
technology,removed,voat could have been good but the first people to really leave reddit in a large amount were the fphcoontown types of people
technology,removed,wow that sux and is false advertising i have unlimited data plan and many days i get over gb data usage so i could cap that in a week
technology,removed,you sound fat
technology,removed,dont even try to act like that shitstain excuse for a subreddit isnt guilty of manipulation it gets so old seeing horrible people cry victim in between inciting hatred and harassing people
technology,removed,because his mindbrain is telling him it is

technology,removed,the mods were deleting comments that were calling it what is was black lives matter protesters killing police in an act of terrorism you can use res and go to the first thread look at all of the delete comments the same thing happened with the nice attack go look at the deleted comments there
technology,removed,i cant wait for reddit to bite the dust and get replaced with digg or whatever someone useful actually creates site has gone to complete and total shit in the past couple of years wont be long now though too bad voat didnt pick up
technology,removed,but theyll ban the next coontown to keep you from it
technology,removed,here some active reddit alternatives to choose from courtesy of rredditalternatives httpsnapzucom invite only but i have a handful pm me for one httpstacksitycom httpsteemitcom httpwwwgetaethernet httpsfrizbeeco httphubskicom httpimzycom httpslicerio httpempeopledcom
technology,removed,considering that most of the reddit users that moved over were from fatpeoplehate coontown european and those bestiality subs voat is pretty much like boiled down coffee very strong bitter horrid black paste that nobody wants
technology,removed,read these comments uspez fuck you
technology,removed,you dont remember people exodusing to voat when those white nationalist subs were quarantined or when fph was banned or when coontown was banned what the admins and mods are doing isnt enough to get people to large scale migrate to voat but that doesnt mean nobody feels pressures that would normally make one migrate
technology,removed,thedonald is a symptom more than a problem itself when reddit lets srs run rampant and shuts downlocks down the previous areas where these people congregated separately they formed a stronger group together not saying all supporters of trump are bad people just reddit shamed and boxed them into single area i think clinton and trump are both evil but just figureheads sort the congress out if you want to change anything
technology,removed,you know why they do it people dont like it when their shitty comments and posts get a spotlight put on them scary spoopy skellingtons coming for their freeze peach
technology,removed,just keep banning people and censor stuff and itll fix the problem in no time theyll need to fix up the safe spaces otherwise peoples fee fees would be seriously hurt if it triggers them
technology,removed,people get ptsd because some troll from pol called them a dindu nuffin
technology,removed,the answer lies in your ridiculous drawnout burn analogy oh ok from your harsh assessment im guessing youre not going to be using any ridiculous drawnout language in your respo but when a year old bay area dingus complains about ptsd while sipping their chai latte grande and polishing the lenses of their hipster gl oh yeah i could keep arguing this but the evidence that everyday things can cause trauma and ptsd symptoms in people is already out there i think im going to go with the psychologicalpsychiatric consensus over what a keyboard psychologist has to say about the subject thanks for your input though
technology,removed,such a sad day for censorship when rcoontown was banned
technology,removed,fbh deserved to be banned and so did coontown both of those subs were hate groups that sent brigades to other subs that said the entire premise of srs promotes brigades and reddit has done absolutely nothing about it
technology,removed,nah its fine with me to drive away the internets scum jewhaters negrohaters fathaters screw em let them rot on voat for all i care why they dont have anything useful to contribute to intellectually stimulating conversations and the most fanatical voices the ones least likely to change their mines are the ones who will speak the loudest to the contrary i think reddit should somehow no idea how encourage really in depth intellectual conversation it makes my whole day on reddit when i see a really smart poster say and argue something really smart the cmv subreddit is not good at this
technology,removed,not true ive been on the net hardcore since racism and being a pure asshole was the only thing on the internet
technology,removed,both those subs are sjw moderators they tightly control everything
technology,removed,is your name michael diamond
technology,removed,all those that left have realized the socjus narritive is bullshit and yet reddit still clings to it like a beaten wife reddit will go down in history as one of many company brought down because they listened to the dogmatic howlings of the regressive left
technology,removed,back in my teenage days when i worked in fast food i was constantly bullied by co workers who would make racist comments to me all day they were so out of control that our black manager left his shift hours earlier because of how they were treating him the rest of management were thieves who would steal from the store and try to blame it on me so they didnt care now i know i aint everybody but bullshit if that was even close to giving me ptsd it was terrible and made me feel like shit but nothing even close to the trauma that ptsd requires and id know because i have ptsd from a workplace incident that left me nearly crippled and my mother has ptsd from when she was a war refugee like i said i know not everyone is the same but if those people actually got ptsd from that then they need to see a therapist because of how fragile their psyche is before someone calling them sir or maam throws them into oblivion
technology,removed,the user base is becoming over populated with more and more pc sjw year old subject matter experts this is genuinely the funniest thing ive read on reddit all month go to any thread on islam hillary or even some random completely unrelated thread on default subs and youll see how well reddits userbase of year old underachievingbutnerdy high school libertarians who are terrified of feminists who might make it harder for them to lose their virginity aged into year old underachievingbutnerdy college trump supporters who are also terrified of immigrants who might make it harder for them to get a job and impress daddy and mommy and now they get to actually vote would be horrifying if trump wasnt polling so low but yeah definitely doesnt seem like reddit is tilting to the left the main userbase has always been composed of people who benefit from racism sexism and the status quo so thats something to be expected even bernie was just a phase for most of them and as soon the possibility of a female president became all too real they jumped to trump pretty fast

technology,removed,it also proved to me that doing the right thing doesnt pay ive got a lot of older games that i still like to play and they mandate that a cd be in the drive to run many modern machines lack optical drives because sometimes the optical drive consumes as much power as the computer does tablet or makes the thing significantly more bulky the developers of these games will not provide official patches to strip out this functionality because either the developer doesnt exist anymore went out of business they would rather force me to buy the game again to enjoy the freedoms that they took from me in the first place if i had just gotten a torrent of the game i would not be in this predicament but since i did the right thing and supported the developers im fucked at that point in life i decided to no longer support developers i buy all games used now to give them the middle finger for what they did to me ive even paid more for used copies than new ones cost just to stiff them
technology,removed,its already back up on katam lol
technology,removed,but its the herpes people love to get
technology,removed,im fairly certain that it would suck less for one person to temporarily lose mod rights if they arent the only mod because theyre being a douche than for an unlimited number of users of a forum to suffer the douche actions of one person so make one person lay in the bed they made or make a mass of people suffer from that one persons actions
technology,removed,if someone called your mother subhuman garbage and threatened to rape her would you be upset
technology,removed,no i dont mean that truly popular campaign posts reaching the front page naturally isnt the same as upvote all policies brigading sticky manipulating meme and fud posting you know that everyone knows that if any given subreddit is popular naturally due to current events and normal posts thats one thingpost and policies designed to purposefully saturate and antagonize rall are another but thats par for the course for the kind of people who spend time on and trump subsits the same core group of trolling shitbags who act the same everywhere they go online
technology,removed,your welcome its an extremely powerful search engine designed it seems especially for porn be careful as it finds stuff that hasnt yet made it to the censors and removed if paired with some sort of domainhost list blocking on your end a lot of the more questionable content wont appear on your computer screen for other closed devices i guess another router paired with domain blocking on the router itself but mine wont allow it nor will they allow another router paired with theirs without a lot of hassle and always having to call them to pair it back up again assholes i would stick with content thats entirely legal in your respective countries as you know big brother is always watching and can bring up your browsing history anytime they like otherwise this search engine is the absolute best porn ive ever seen in my life google and everything else completely and utterly sucks in comparison
technology,removed,no shit

technology,removed,netflix already has a deal to stream the new star trek series worldwide
technology,removed,they are sold a lot on reddit but i dont understand why given they are an american company and beholden to nsls and other measures i cant believe that the fbimpiaa would just say oh those people are using a vpn so we cant find them so we just have to give up on all of this they know what company the servers belong to
technology,removed,and hopefully the idiots who run this will spend the rest of their lives in jail too as do those who use the site to steal whiny entitled spoiled children

technology,removed,how do you use these is there a setting required i have gone through transmissions preferences and cant find anything related to this anywhere it always says sending totals to tracker when shutting down but there is no menu or options related to that
technology,removed,hulu has a small amount of content compared to netflix and is owned by the content producers and thus likely has unique revenue arrangements and much of hulus available content is also behind the hulu plus paywall which is priced higher than netflix the fact that hulu exists and offers a few things supported by ads does not mean netflixs overhead is huge

technology,removed,naah on facebook i was not able to post so i bought a new domain and redirected it to wittyfeed
technology,removed,i mean i see your point of view but i wasnt saying to be able to vote in mods and a sub will always have at least one active mod so if theres only one mod of a sub theyre untouchable by voting set the threshold high enough and i think it can work no matter what system you have in place even the current one of no system it will get abused by some people we can all agree that mod abuse does happen this would just give the users a way to suppress the abusive mod

technology,removed,tbh i dont know why people pay for music its so much easier to pirate i dont even understand why people would subscribe to a service like google music seems silly
technology,removed,i do the millenials think cryptography should exist to protect them in illegal ventures thats all this is they cannot be happy they make money through tech they want more its greed at its finest in addition to taxing and securing our country with the currency it is in our national defense interests to keep tabs on secretive transactions as a politsci major you guys are being silly then again im old school so tech isnt my strongsuit but this is the type of people youre facing and all youre telling us is what we want defeasts the concept of x or y thing we dont see a why and we sure as hell dont have the time to reseacrh it so when you question why the us is where it is with technology its because we want simplicity and proper governance it has nothing to do with spying on you i could give a crap less if you have a kinky whip fetish or if you are sending money to your russian bride thats it really

technology,removed,i didnt want the frustration of messing up my windows setup so i run puppy linux from a live cd it works great if i have to use windows which is rarely now i take my linux cd out my cd drive and reboot to windows puppy linux came with firefox and open source software i save settings for firefox and my hardware on a flash drive it has the added benefit of being easily portable from one computer to the other

technology,removed,you mentioned daily driver so im not really sure what you were talking about classic and historical cars often have nothing at all to do with daily drivers but youre right those people who would drive their bel air to work might no longer have that opportunity however many people who own collector cars own regular cars as well owning a classic or historic car is already an expensive hobby and while it may become more expensive its very hard to tell whether or if the cost would be offset by more people abandoning the hobby decreasing demand and increasing the relative number of available parts and vehicles plus youd have to consider where these people live while rural collectors might be particularly inconvenienced urban collectors might hardly see any change at all maybe the nearest gas station is miles away instead of on top of all of that there are numerous successful businesses centered on the support and restoration of classic cars if theres a new obstacle in that industry im pretty confident that theyll figure out a way to make it all work

technology,removed,why is there a need for this when there are perfectly good designated shitting streets all around
technology,removed,youre a fucking idiot who has probably never done a days real work in your life waving your arms over a large screen for hours is way too much work i wouldnt even want to see anyone doing that

technology,removed,i hope that every single comcast employee gets nut cancer yes the women too
technology,removed,prove it
technology,removed,the hyperbole with which trump supporters speak is what is so annoying to them it isnt that she used an email practice that was similar to that of her predecessors and later admitted it was a mistake it is that she leaked state secrets it isnt that she was involved in a terrible attacks at benghazi that tragically killed four americans it is that she killed four americans it isnt that she did her job as a public defender and gave her client the best defense possible it is that she intentionally manipulated the system to further attack a rape victim you said it perfectly i also have been around politics and grew up in a republican household and am still conservative but i get attacked by my friends and family as being a libtard because i cannot support this deplorable man if dt is the new conservative then i guess i am not conservative anymore also calling someone a liberal is not an insult i would much rather be called liberal than whatever label dts supporters call themselves
technology,removed,zuckerberg telling lies no
technology,removed,if you held facts in high regard you would go where they exist regardless of who says them brietbart can be wrong more often than not and is they can be wrong of the time intellectual tolerance requires you to respect the that theyre right youre simply dishonest with yourself
technology,removed,you poor thing

technology,removed,okay hillary shill

technology,removed,i know
technology,removed,itt mentally challenged people like in every apple related thread
technology,removed,paypal apologists out already nice damage control shills
technology,removed,so either you believe youre on the computer a da i am bitch
technology,removed,update an earlier version of this story reported that capossela was interviewed by softpedia while softpedia was reported elsewhere as originating the story the actual interview was done by extremetech regrets the error the link to windows weekly is a gizmodo article about carrie fisher
technology,removed,raw dicking a thai ladyboy is also awesome but youre going to be dealing with the repercussions for years windows is pretty similar in that regard
technology,removed,in which programming language are continue statements outside of loops a thing
technology,removed,youd be surprised the reason many experts are still using windows is because it allows you to keep using software for older versions hell you could load a diskette with lotus into windows and it will probably still work but if you tried this thing on linux you cant really expect it to keep working oftentimes when you upgrade your linux distro you will be able to keep most of your programs but youll often notice that there will be apps that break in all other aspects linux is better than windows many people will choose windows because experts say that they should and the reason that happens is because of compatibility
technology,removed,if you go outside the pc world linux is used more than windows eg android many many embedded systems and is much better than windows at many things ill admit im a power user but i like using linux a lot more than windows and find it easier to do things than trying to get around the retarded restrictions windows puts up and trying to figure out how to fix anything when it breaks because it hides itself in shame and doesnt let anyone have any idea how it actually works for my daily desktop use i find it easier and more efficient to use linux than windows and linux beats windows as a server every day of the week
technology,removed,like linux
technology,removed,if they detect us an eavesdrop they will surely quarantine our star system from contact
technology,removed,sounds like youre looking for something like httpskoditv redditcomrkodi or httpspopcorntimeshen redditcomrpopcorntime
technology,removed,probably bent the battery on it super bendy phones
technology,removed,and their hosting costs they must be brutal
technology,removed,and the shilling is strong in this one half of the netflix shows are garbage with each one having star reviews to trick you into watching it
technology,removed,well i guess its up to the banks to decide i personally dont care how secure my card is since i am not liable for any charges i didnt make it wouldnt matter to me if my bank card was a piece of paper the bankmerchant loses not myself
technology,removed,chip and pin you need to type in a pin when you insert your card so if someone steals your card they need to know that number to use it chip and signature you just sign your name on the screen or on the receipt if someone steals your card they can still use it because no one checks to see if the signature is actually yours
technology,removed,i think the chip cards are harder to counterfeit than the mag strip cards so it does offer some additional security
technology,removed,when i worked at a retail job i always hated people who would put see id on the back of their cards and then get pissed off when i didnt check their id the truth is my boss wouldnt have let me refuse their card even if they didnt have their id with them all they have to say is that they left their id at home or the card belongs to a relative and my boss would have told me to swipe it
technology,removed,october is when the legal liability shift happened and everyone was supposed to switch over less than a year ago in theory those who havent switched are a bit more liable in the event of identity theft but the negative incentives havent quite overpowered the pervasive laziness yet
technology,removed,ops entire posting history is what i would imagine when i look at paid gop shills history i dont give a shit about either candidate stop cluttering up this entire site with shit posts
technology,removed,seems like it would be unlikely for them to guess the correct pin with several attempts even if it was only four digits assuming you didnt use or something stupid like that
technology,removed,i hope not
technology,removed,if you had more upvotes id call you a shill
technology,removed,it pulls movies and shows from streaming sites you can set it up to be just like netflix but with basically unlimited free content
technology,removed,how the hell are people purchasing phones that arent out yet and who the fuck wants a phone you cant plug your headphones into its all just a scam so the jews can charge more
technology,removed,how does it feel knowing you probably made someone buy a piece of shit product because you were lucky enough to get it for free in exchange for ass kissing
technology,removed,thanks
technology,removed,yes this is annoying they should make seller reviews better somehow though because sometimes its useful info someone saying they got a fake item for example doesnt say much about the product and shouldnt be in a product review but i still want to know
technology,removed,so decay review weighting by time passed instead of release date idk
technology,removed,how many times does this need to be debunked for this company to go away
technology,removed,i didnt even mention politics im correcting the shite you spewed about thiel and that link backs up my point
technology,removed,what a piece of shit butthurt little bitch to be honest
technology,removed,in the eu yes in the us there isnt a general federal law that protects discrimination of political opinion in the private sector but there are some specific forms that are protected and some statescountiescities that have their own more advanced laws
technology,removed,the spotify desktop client is a horrible construct in very many ways not to mention the bugs and the cpugpuintensive design just the lack of features is absurd considering their revenue relies on their clients ease of access to music for better search at least you can rely on a connected lastfm account
technology,removed,why are liberals so hostile and extreme look at the recent demonstrations and now this dumb ass of a ceo saying restarted things
technology,removed,wow what a contradiction nope not at all just because its prevalent among whites doesnt mean its exclusive to them not hard to get pundits dont reflect reality just admit you were wrong when you claimed i only get my information from conservatives pundits arent the only source of info either thats a pretty terrible straw man
technology,removed,good
technology,removed,the left is going to project themselves to eight years of trump lol i cannot control my joy
technology,removed,what experience do you have to make that decision what exact requirements are necessary for president years as a senator or could it be less if they are a democrat
technology,removed,i worked for a republican ceo during obamas term although he didnt threaten us he gave a yearly speeches telling the whole company how we had fallen on dark times and how terrible things were going in america with obama meanwhile the company tripled revenue in those years
technology,removed,the only ones crying are suburban white girls whose only hardship is picking which pumpkin spice latte to get while driving a car mommy and daddy bought them for college entitled fucks dont know a goddamn thing about struggling
technology,removed,the js has a basic regex check thisisvalidemail function return thisemail it isnt anything complicated
technology,removed,trump has been pretty vocally against mergers esp the proposed att and directtv merger
technology,removed,your enemies closer
technology,removed,as if we havent hated him for years because he holds a lot of rallies yet spouts hate the whole time were supposed to be cool with him man fuck you idiots i dont even have the energy to talk to such morons downvote me with imaginary points all you want just fuck off
technology,removed,i agree with mr trump going forward to find intelligent ways to bring back the great american workforce through manufacturing infrastructure fair trade agreements etc one of the things in particular i love about america is our acceptance of technology and the internet id like to see the internet kept open and free for people to express themselves and be heard creativity is ultimately what drives our country and is what puts us ahead and at the top id love to see the market for internet be competitive and to break up monopolies that internet providers have for example in my area we only have time warner cable as a legitimate high speed internet option thank you dont copy this this is your country and your voice find something that matters to you and be heard
technology,removed,really good
technology,removed,they will probably assign that guy some help chill out
technology,removed,if youre for climate control add that in too please
technology,removed,yes thats it and maybe just maybe i am delusional about the fact that bernies coming back but one can have hope right as for lies whos truly lying here youre trying to make hillary into some messiah when obv atleast half of voters agreed that shes not nobody likes her youre in the minority and have no idea what youre talking about find some facts for me and then well talk
technology,removed,eat shit and die nazi scum
technology,removed,there is currently one vacancy in the supreme court that was caused by scalia passing scalia did dissent on gay marriage so if they put back someone who is against it in his place the court will be the same political bias as it was when gay marriage passed if there is another vacancy in the next years then you can start to worry more about change in direction on social domain laws but right now panicking about roe vs wade and gay marriage is only going to hurt you because a court with scalia on it passed gay marriage i would worry much more about the sort of thing like citizens united and such laws because on social issues the court isnt about to do a but on campaign finance and corruption we have seen the court is quite fucked up
technology,removed,my parents
technology,removed,the article said that the only reason for wheeler to leave would be voluntarily its customary for fcc leads to step down on a white house party change but not mandatory trump is irrelevant if wheeler leaves get mad at wheeler himself why is the article headline making it seem like trump is gonna kick him out personally i dont see why he should bail when hes doing such a good job
technology,removed,doot doot
technology,removed,honeypots
technology,removed,i was gonna get an iphone as my last phones were apple and they treated me well but after removing the headphone jack hell nah pixel xl is in the mail to me as we type some of us will switch at least the smart ones will
technology,removed,facebook should be nationalized
technology,removed,in case anyone reading this thread doesnt know uglassclose is full of shit the vast majority of hillarys speeches are available online and are completely innocuous furthermore her compensation is on par with other major politicians and less than what trump receives just because is a lot for the common person doesnt mean a politician can be bought for that sum
technology,removed,companies have already begun toeing his line sorry to burst your lil bubble
technology,removed,yourcouch points years ago its not islam its peoples interpretation of islam notice when slavery was legal in the united states rape of slaves which were by definition that which the right hand possesses was also perfectly legal and occurred frequently islam is not a violent or evil religion like you try to paint it youre pulling up archaic laws used in a different time period when women had few rights moroccan iranian kurdish maldivan american pakistani and most other countries with a large muslim face no such problems because it is not an inherently violent religion you are insulting nearly of the worlds population without discretion that makes you a bigot isis is horrible but they do not define islam their war is political and powerbased not a religious war like they pretend ahem go fuck yourself
technology,removed,obama lolno

technology,removed,ops title isnt the title of the linked article the linked article is an interesting development in renewable energy infrastructure op is of course a dirty title editorialising faggot but theyre a symptom of people who only want to read extremely exciting news tip progress is slow most news of each step isnt exciting
technology,removed,oracle is appealing dont be too happy yet tldr for whoever missed the news why is this case important if you need permission to use apis as in licenses and the like then it might cause a headache for developers you can i think technically be sued for using apis if the copyright holders wished to but ianal for example if a share to twitter link on your webpage used the twitter api twitter could technically sue you not that they even would but just that its technically possible afaik if oracle had won then developers may be a bit more waryscared when buildings apps that connect to other services using apis perhaps maybe reducing the functionality of some applications what happened generally in a tldr sense albeit noncomprehensive and could be wrong in this lawsuit oracle sues google for copyright infringement related to the java apis may court rules that oracle cannot copyright its java apis may us court of appeals for the federal circuit partially reverses the above ruling in favor of oracle while the fair use issues were sent to a lower court june a petition to review parts of the case tried in a lower court legally known as httpsenwikipediaorgwikicertiorari was denied by the united states supreme court may second trial begins oracle seeks billion to quote pcworld for profit google made from android including mobile advertising and apps and content sold through the android market and google play may court rules in favor of google ruling that the apis being used was fair use
technology,removed,youre putting words in my mouth the person i replied to said all we need to do is overturn citizens united to decrease moneys influence in politics which isnt true while it would be a laudable achievement its only step one

technology,removed,pihole comes up a lot in these discussions and i have issues with it youre implying a need for hardware to to have good blocking which just isnt the case as shown by the numerous extensions in this comment section this makes it seem like privacy is something you need to spend money to get which just isnt true also youre adding another device to use electricity and increase your network lag for no reason because everyone can do this right now all pihole is doing is adding yet another networking device to your workflow step configure dns its completely solved by editing your local hosts file with one such as httpsomeonewhocaresorghosts which you can also do at your router level on some routers additionally if youre on a laptop modifying the local hosts file brings the privacy instructions to you not to mention the setup instructions curlpiping into bash while claiming to be a privacy tool ugh tldr hosts level blocking can be done without a rasp pi and you can do it right now and have better performance without spending any money use your router or modify your local hosts file to add a list such as httpsomeonewhocaresorghosts
technology,removed,are you talking about ghost rank in that case youre opted out by default so what you really mean is that they sell your information anomalously if you opt in the only annoying thing i feel about ghostery is that installing it isnt enough you have to actually go to the settings and choose to block all the trackers i didnt know that for the longest time because most addons work immediately after install
technology,removed,oh no i like this scenario my entitled ass can sue when i get infected right now its just a case of bad luck with no consequence
technology,removed,i disagree that people oppose the update out of rational reasons so you think that its fine for os to do what ever it wants without ever consulting you about it because on you can no longer disable autoupdate
technology,removed,same here i installed the latest drivers for my card and it ended up black screening then it uninstalled my video card drivers and installed its own no idea what is going on with this os
technology,removed,all the the windows stuff falls under optional updates right
technology,removed,i mean what do i have to lose right you could just burn a dvd and try ubuntu that way before installing worst would be you have a dvd that you dont need
technology,removed,it is because of technical interference source i worked in att advanced tech department the fm signal is known to interfere with the cell signal and that is why it is disabled i have heard people try to argue that phones have allowed it before and they are right however all of those phones have either been streaming a signal over the cell signal or use the headphone jack with headphones plugged in and the headphone wire itself becomes the antenna they are not going to approve this and if they do it will come with a big bold warning use at your own discretion fm signal known to interrupt cell signal carrier not responsible for service interruption due to fm signal connection and that is why it is disabled on the hardware side so ignorant people who think they know everything cant just hack the software turn it on then call their carrier and bitch about signal issues
technology,removed,im not disagreeing with you i know im lazy with this shit but at the same time if i buy a laptop with a certain os i think its not unreasonable to have the option to keep that os for the normal life span of a laptop its not like im a holdout after years with the same os i have had it for only like years why am i being forced to change im not at all a fan of os x and i am very familiar with windows i have heard too many stories of people having problems during the upgrade even if its a low chance id rather not fuck my day up if my current setup works perfectly for my needs i just dont know why i should upgrade other than because microsoft says so there isnt a single upgrade feature that i find worthy of my time

technology,removed,it is a little more like breaking into someones house and stealing their keys to open a vault than psychically stopping a crime think about the ways this could be abused imagine if you got hacked and you thought it was corporate espionage and you hacked your biggest competitor that would be terrible hey i am a huge skeptic of government but even here i think this is somewhere that is in the polices domain more than vigilantes
technology,removed,i agree with you it is morally good but what are the consequences that could arise from this becoming legal that is what concerns me in my opinion he is a wonderful person
technology,removed,how
technology,removed,or end it
technology,removed,the main concern is that we would be giving hackers more legal rights than the government to investigate crime the government would require a warrant and rightfully so the hacker would judge off a vague ruling and then go fight in court after it
technology,removed,didn do nuffin
technology,removed,the problem with my torture dungeon filled with chinese women is that i just get horny again in an hour
technology,removed,as if the pistol you have is going to do jack shit when the government comes for you at least you can kill yourself with it so theres that
technology,removed,top kek
technology,removed,if we leave you to your devices youll be arguing for underage sex trafficking to solve this countrys woes
technology,removed,so should i stop downloading from my private tracker this is kinda fucked up and extreme i definitely dont want to give money to the movie industry greedy jews
technology,removed,thats one hell of a tangent youve careened into
technology,removed,in a democracy one should never be afraid to speak out against ones government ftfy
technology,removed,i think the bigger thing is hes getting a bigger sentence
technology,removed,got em
technology,removed,maybe the kerry gaa but that would purely be out of spite
technology,removed,youre a fucking idiot being white matters because historically almost all of the power held in this country has been say it with me rich old white so it makes a great deal of sense that the problems they most fear are the ones that get dealt with most harshly
technology,removed,the usa has almost entirely been powered by a government staffed entirely at the top by rich old white men fuck you moron
technology,removed,i anal
technology,removed,air iair is sii the air fuck fcuk shit you assholes fuck yiu shiet th automoderator fact you noghy as wholes cunt your are all cunts oderators are often dicks and cocksa and cunts shit crap merde fucjk yiou low life creutures bunrnrjdjcnvndksofnfjslawowsksdkcjrghthtjbjzomlokmjunhghtvhfchssjaja
technology,removed,so hes definitely going to jail obama you have job to do instead of shilling
technology,removed,its horrifying that people here can justify a teenager being sent to prison for over a decade for a nonviolent crime a decade let that sink in every other fact aside its a decade in prison for a nonviolent crime

technology,removed,haha smart daughter
technology,removed,ya its the right that are fascists
technology,removed,yep ladar did the honorable thing im sure for every lavabit there are hundreds or thousands of companies quietly complying

technology,removed,having servers in multiple regions is not decentralization if there is still central control im assuming this is what you are referring to as the vast majority of vpns consist of dedicated servers owned by companies selling vpn services tor and freenet are decentralized isnt especially if they make any kind of minimum performance guarantees
technology,removed,and still people love that cia inqtel project
technology,removed,i like how you keep trying to talk down to me despite being wrong its like you think being a dick will make you right instead of a joke good luck with that
technology,removed,good point
technology,removed,im sure you could come up with a scheduler of your own big boy
technology,removed,soi guess we should just shoot all the computers america is retarded
technology,removed,not for old people those fuckers cant get enough of those goddamn flash ecards
technology,removed,man trump really duped his idiot followers into believing anything critical of trumpenfuhrer is fake news
technology,removed,why would you blame russia anyway wikileaks released emails from the dnc
technology,removed,httpswwwcrowdstrikecomblogbearsmidstintrusiondemocraticnationalcommittee eat shit you stupid fucking trumpanzee every single intelligence agency that looks at the evidence comes to the same conclusion it was russia that includes multiple independent non us based agencies even kaspersky which is russian but youre going to move the fucking goalposts again because youre a delusional fucktard of a person with zero rational ability
technology,removed,solar as a replacement is a dream as long as cost per cell remains infeasible the question of finding places to put them is wildly insignificant compared to the ppu also you still need the infrastructure as if that requirement would magically disappear when the cell ppu goes down efficiency per cell and capacitance are tertiary considerations
technology,removed,necessary
technology,removed,oh god its like you know just enough information to sound knowledgeable but to anyone who is actually an expert youre a fucking moron
technology,removed,trump is an anti intellectual imbecile get used to this nonsense oh btw thanks for not voting
technology,removed,i think that computers have complicated lives very greatly the whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on my cell phone for example i have to replace it often because it commits suicide it commits suicide yugely splattering parts all over my golden shitter we did not have this problem with wax tablets not nearly so often
technology,removed,just your typical dumbass fear mongering antitrump faggot here nothing to see youre worthless
technology,removed,but youre a shill
technology,removed,god that would be so rich the internet literally got him elected and now hes going to censor the very thing those basement dwellers need to survive talk about cucked jesus
technology,removed,i can never really tell these days sorry mang
technology,removed,sorry but us intelligence agencies arent going to release national secrets so that some neck beard in their basement can second guess experts this is among the dumbest things i have ever heard anyone say
technology,removed,so youre just an establishment shill
technology,removed,so did bernie sanders
technology,removed,but hes literally a shill though
technology,removed,lmaooo a technology subreddit is sourcing huffpo bill clinton is a rapist infowarscom
technology,removed,i absolutely hate trump and his supporters but now i have started to hate retarded liberal morons and antitrump media also rational fact checking editors who upvote every post with trump says hurr durr please you idiots read the fucking article and check the exact quote he clearly says the whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on which is true the liberal messiah hillary clinton asked wipe the computer like with a cloth that clearly shows that these politicians know nothing about computers think how difficult for your grandfathers to understand google same goes for these politicians they dont understand computers as a matter of fact even i cannot understand how this hacking and volte manipulation happens then he says we have speed we have a lot of other things but im not sure we have the kind the security we need which is right i didnt see him saying should not blame russia but i agree with that it is kremlins responsibility to do things like that on the other hand its us information security guys who should prevent such hackings so the blame should be on us
technology,removed,e d g y
technology,removed,
technology,removed,just wait til some incel figures out trumps twitter password and tweets out that he just launched a steath nuke attack on china u know lulz but its a good thing we screamed about hillarys unsecured email server when trump communicates on a platform accessible by any computer on the planet hell i fucking guarantee that every major international intelligence agency is sitting on his login info right fucking now just waiting
technology,removed,obama already has that title what a joke of a man and a disgrace to the office lucking the magic negro will be out soon and well have someone competent in charge
technology,removed,literally fucking anything why is this such a strange concept to you youre right ive been given the opinions of the nations best experts based on report which i have absolutely no idea where that information came from if i gave a pile of shit to the nations best sewage expert and then more sanitation experts agreed it was shit that doesnt tell me anything about where it came from
technology,removed,you dont know youre a shill
technology,removed,sorry didnt realize you were a russian shill when i first replied
technology,removed,god this man is an idiot id literally just face palmed
technology,removed,to respond to a comment saying that hurling insults isnt how you gain traction in a conversational debate to hurl insults im not trying to debate you im just calling you an asshole
technology,removed,good let them rot
technology,removed,no just a little fairness would help i dont think that one can make all activities fair and equal but the one thing that is most daming to any greed is the public disclosure that it was unfair i think that we are going to see more outings of unfair behavior and with it the public humiliation and legal response the gloves are off with trump in charge business activities have become fair game for shame
technology,removed,your interest counts before the interest of the rest of the world thanks fuck you
technology,removed,they recently released a new cartoon on their youtube channel
technology,removed,it comes across youre saying only sheeple use windowsmac kind of like those annoying vegans i agree windows is a disaster for privacy however you can turn it all off at which brings it back to parity windows even if you choose to use linux its not easy to live up to rmss standards better get used to surfing the web with wget everyone has their own priorities and will draw their own line where they want
technology,removed,so if i click on this outgoing link to read this article does that put me on a list probably already in trouble for posting this comment i like reading bruces articles shame im scared to read this one
technology,removed,the cover up lies and blaming others bothers me more than the way she set up the emails this is a character flaw this is how she will handle anything as president that she thinks might make her her look bad
technology,removed,the buck stops anywhere but here
technology,removed,missed your thorazine today
technology,removed,its actually the opposite of that people that follow rules should never be in leadership positions a good way to be poor is to follow rules
technology,removed,well the alternative is deadly force less lethal options are preferable but not always practical
technology,removed,there are surely other websites more suitable for that you freak
technology,removed,i want her to die horrifically
technology,removed,a lot of americans have a vengeance justice fetish this and the gun obsession are weird and unique to american amongst first world countries i really dont understand it maybe its rooted in helplessness and unfairness they feel in their own lives so when they see a bad guy they want him to pay severely so they can feel there is some right in the worldbut i just dont understand why its so common in the usa
technology,removed,i think he might have learned after pulse has he said much of anything since then ive only been seeing the unending parade of hillary news this past month
technology,removed,or because i have lived here most of my life and know first hand
technology,removed,lowerclass is better than middleclass
technology,removed,theyre still using flash cookies though better privacy to the rescue
technology,removed,go suck obamas dick oh wait you cant because hes playing touch butt in europe im sure you are proud
technology,removed,a ceo cant even blame his subordinates for neglect which is a regulation of the federal government yet hillary can blame her subordinates for her own orders lol
technology,removed,ive used am ive met several actual real women through the site so i have to disagree with you
technology,removed,i agree with you but it still feels weird it was never done before for a reason and it feels like now its opening a door that i dont know were ready to be opened is it going to be put into handbooks and done as a matter of course now what threshold does one need to cross before we do this how far can we bend that threshold under the guise of officer safety make no mistake if every police force in the country could carry drones armed with lethal force to deploy at a moments notice instead of risking officers safety they will all jump at the opportunity are we ready for that world
technology,removed,you love your strawmen
technology,removed,the debate seems insane to me honestly i thought it was common sense that when you take a military grade rifle into an elevated position entrench yourself and begin murdering law enforcement officers you implicitly surrender your rights as an american citizen hence why officers can kill you for their protection you still have human rights so when a bomb disposal robot tortures the individual we can discuss the ethical considerations but you dont have a right to have your safety protected at all i know the fashion as of late is to try and solidify antiestablishment views through ever increasing manipulation of what was once common sense but suggesting he somehow wasnt an equal threat to peoples lives as a military combatant or that he deserves better treatment than a combatant is frankly extremely stupid
technology,removed,your perspective on the situation and police seems very poorly considered to me you realize police are human beings who dont deserve to be murdered right not to mention that theyre not soldiers painful as it may be to the ultrasensitive in the real world an individuals actions have consequences murdering innocent people and continuing to attempt the murder of additional innocents does not afford you the sustained right to safety any reasonable person would have directed a police sniper to kill him if it were possible as he was obviously posing a continued threat to human life humans shooters are not idiots and this is not a video game puzzle for you to solve any attempt at suppression will put more police lives at risk and that is absolutely unacceptable again police are people not your pawns to sacrifice every situation is different and nonletal force is always preferred this situation posed a clear continued threat to public safety and the solution was appropriate
technology,removed,the problem with your response and many others in this thread is that you dont seem to consider police to be people whos lives matter you seem to approach this problem as if it were a video game and police were pawns whos lives were yours to sacrifice the police need to remember that theyre there to serve the people all of them including the ones shooting at them this is very very incorrect frankly nearing the point of stupidity it is not the polices job to serve those shooting at them the police enforce the communal laws and sustain order protect and serve is a common motto not an inflexible decree from those who insist they risk their lives and die to protect those who are trying to murder them just because you can imagine a situation where a dangerous unstable person could be brought under control with nonlethal force doesnt mean every situation can or should be resolved that way
technology,removed,tear gas as well as all forms of gas are deliberately avoided in wartime due to fears that they can be construed as chemical weapons rather than nonlethal dispersion gas in addition bad actors could allegedly arm up with tear gas cans which end up being sarin or something
technology,removed,with a cursory overview of information at hand by suggesting they should have continued attempting nonviolent methods youre implying they should continue risking their livesdying for the effort there are bombs all over the place in this garage and downtown is a direct quote from the shooter the only plausible suggestion that doesnt show extreme disregard for police lives is allowing the standoff to go on indefinitely if youre confident you have one shooter in a controlled area maybe you can make that suggestion that night there was a lot of uncertainty relating to how many people were involved where they could get to downtown dallas is a big place who was still in harms way etc the situation absolutely needed to be diffused asap and not one innocent life should have been risked if avoidable
technology,removed,what about a predator drone why not have cops with hand grenades
technology,removed,theres nothing that could be done he is military trained so tear gas and stun grenades will not be effective as its part of combat training i know a young man who went through boot camp recently and gave me some details esp on tear gas plus talks broke down he claimed to have ieds in the area ready to detonate he wanted to kill more white cops besides the five confirmed theres unfortunately no gray area unless they risk more police or civilian casualties
technology,removed,anything i can personally do to shit on the advertisement industry is ok with me id pay extra for it
technology,removed,if you stalked me purchased my data from other people and forced me to look at ads for your pizza place id put in fake orders till you went out of business then i take a shit on your car
technology,removed,the link to manually install the adnausium extension is down good i can only imagine damage this thread is causing i wonder if i can pay extra for a vial of advertiser tears
technology,removed,google or apple have a better shot imo
technology,removed,you know these people have addresses though this might sound a little extreme but i find myself sincerely wondering why people havent gone all french revolution on these guys and just murdered them in their own homes like what is stopping people from taking the ceo of comcast or their major shareholders and just dragging them into the streets and making an example of them why do we rely on systems of authority to protect our interests when all it would really take is a few pissed off people with sharp pointy objects
technology,removed,sounds about right myspace did the same thing by counting unique ip addresses instead of unique user agent values
technology,removed,trump has literally come out against net neutrality net neutrality is a law that the upcoming potus is literally against how are you so dense that you dont realize hes a huge factor in whether its upheld or dismantled
technology,removed,oh trust me i do
technology,removed,correct on your first paragraph
technology,removed,tldr want faster internet with more isps competing then net neutrality isnt the way to go hear me out on why im opposed to net neutrality i believe the telecom industry has stagnated on both upgrading existing infrastructure and the ability to provide service at levels of both cost and data comparable to other nations net neutrality in my mind will change the internet for the better through short term pain are companies doing this to increase their bottom line absolutely everyone in the industry knows this but many people dont consider why the government still supports the agenda part lobbying yes i know theres two major plays here on the government side first the cost of upgrading existing infrastructure for the government is very expensive currently new lines are subsidized by the government that means all those cell towers upgrades and laying of fiber adds cost to local municipalities state and federal government because one of the governing charter articles of the fcc is to provide internet access to all americans its why copperdsl is still accessible out in very rural areas where the population cant sustain the infrastructure requirements many people compare the internet to water and electricity utilities by allowing the isps to charge for data prioritization upload bandwidth etc the government hopes that businesses and individuals will be able to infuse the companies with more cash for growth wait wont the isps just keep the profit because shareholders well yes at first maybe the second point the republicans want to get rid of net neutrality is to increase competition currently internet providers are generally monopolies in areas they operate only areas of higher population density such urban centers of towns and large cities support multiple options this occurs for a few reasons of which the most important is customer market potential in non metro areas there simply arent enough customers to both support multiple isps let alone justify infrastructure upgrades companies dont randomly put massive infrastructure projects in the middle of nowhere they go in areas that generate the most amount profit if net neutrality didnt exist companies and individuals pay more money making the overall market bigger this means isps can now pay for not only upgrading there networks but the hope is that the overall market size grows enough to the point where isps can compete in each others areas and both still be profitable the negative consequences towards consumers and businesses in my opinion are overblown while the law is not yet defined the lack of net neutrality can go ways the first is isps will prioritize data for higher paying customers lets stop and think about what this really means one of the key oppositions to this point of data prioritization is the fear that smaller businesses will be squeezed out of the market this simply will not occur heres why data prioritization impacts consumers and companies in two ways it is important to realize there are three tiers of internet service residential small business provides static ip address and direct internet access dia literally a direct link to an isp the differences being that residential services dont typically have a service level agreement sla which govern things like uptime and bandwidth connection speedsreliability business internet is more expensive because first they not only need a downstream to let customers connect to their website but they need also need to send data back to the consumer also by paying more businesses are guaranteed a level of quality in their sla so they dont have to worry about slow internet speeds and customers not being able to go on their website to purchase things residential internet on the other hand is oversubscribed which means that it might get slow if too many people use it at once this occurs because isps to save costs switches aged infrastructure bandwidth limitations etc go with best effort stipulation it basically means that hey the internet speed will be what we promised for like of the day but for probably between when everyone gets home and streams stuff at the same time youll have slower internet oversubscription isnt supposed to happen your ideally meant to get the internet you paid for maybe even gigabit speeds if your lucky isps constantly change their access to meet demand but from their side it just doesnt make sense to spend the money on constant infrastructure improvements when they can say hey of them time it works all the time perfectly at speeds you paid for ill explain how paying for internet speed is already similar to paying for data prioritization in a second but first lets focus on the actual prioritization part itself so the concept of data prioritization and paying for it somehow just irks people the wrong way in reality itll make content faster reliable and less bloated i liken internet data traffic to two imaginary pipes with packets flowing in and out one pipe represents the consumer viewing content and the other pipe the business website your trying to link to currently all traffic is treated equal great but what if i told you that internet video makes up of all traffic that means someone in your community that watches netflix streams nfl etc really hog up the bandwidth in the pipes leaving less room for everyone else and often times causing oversubscription to the network theres two fixes for this first data prioritization or second getting bigger pipes data prioritization refers to the packets flowing in the pipes and the actual pipes themselves represent bandwidth speeds currently the pipes are shared which leads to network congestion you can request bigger pipes sure by increasing your internet speed but in reality unless a lot of people in your community do it as well it will only increase the oversubscribed cap by a small margin to accommodate to truly build a larger pipe means digging stuff up and laying more cable which is a far more expensive process that would costs tens of thousands of dollars data prioritization is a superior fix it means either a consumer or business pay for the amount of space in in the pipe if a gigabit pipe is laid for a small neighborhood houses data prioritization and paying more for it means that a customer may buy of the capacity of the pipe at any given moment ensuring they are not effected by network congestion of their neighbors using netflix or whatever basically it forms a sla with the isp and youll get the speed you paid for assuming the company on the other end also prioritizes their pipe which they already more or less do now on the companies side they already have an sla agreement with the isps data prioritization effects them a bit differently their pipes can already accommodate all their data the problem is that when it reaches the customer pipes that companies like netflix youtube really hog them up as video uses of the pipe because all internet must be treated equally loading small pages take much longer because of network congestion it makes sensefeasible for companies especially ecommerce websites to pay to let their content load before netflixyoutube for them loading a single website maybe but a video on netflix is or more assuming the consumer on the other end doesnt have data prioritization small data companies can pay to load their data to the customer at quicker speeds in congested networks feasibly if netflix or youtube tried to do this for all their data i doubt theyd be able to afford it so instead they will just use whatever capacity of the pipe is leftover
technology,removed,can you say the same thing about people against net neutrality then tldr want faster internet with more isps competing then net neutrality isnt the way to go hear me out on why im

their pipes can already accommodate all their data the problem is that when it reaches the customer pipes that companies like netflix youtube really hog them up as video uses of the pipe because all internet must be treated equally loading small pages take much longer because of network congestion it makes sensefeasible for companies especially ecommerce websites to pay to let their content load before netflixyoutube for them loading a single website maybe but a video on netflix is or more assuming the consumer on the other end doesnt have data prioritization small data companies can pay to load their data to the customer at quicker speeds in congested networks feasibly if netflix or youtube tried to do this for all their data i doubt theyd be able to afford it so instead they will just use whatever capacity of the pipe is leftover
technology,removed,im sorry but regular joes dont get why net neutrality needs to be removed tldr want faster internet with more isps competing then net neutrality isnt the way to go hear me out on why im opposed to net neutrality i believe the telecom industry has stagnated on both upgrading existing infrastructure and the ability to provide service at levels of both cost and data comparable to other nations net neutrality in my mind will change the internet for the better through short term pain are companies doing this to increase their bottom line absolutely everyone in the industry knows this but many people dont consider why the government still supports the agenda part lobbying yes i know theres two major plays here on the government side first the cost of upgrading existing infrastructure for the government is very expensive currently new lines are subsidized by the government that means all those cell towers upgrades and laying of fiber adds cost to local municipalities state and federal government because one of the governing charter articles of the fcc is to provide internet access to all americans its why copperdsl is still accessible out in very rural areas where the population cant sustain the infrastructure requirements many people compare the internet to water and electricity utilities by allowing the isps to charge for data prioritization upload bandwidth etc the government hopes that businesses and individuals will be able to infuse the companies with more cash for growth wait wont the isps just keep the profit because shareholders well yes at first maybe the second point the republicans want to get rid of net neutrality is to increase competition currently internet providers are generally monopolies in areas they operate only areas of higher population density such urban centers of towns and large cities support multiple options this occurs for a few reasons of which the most important is customer market potential in non metro areas there simply arent enough customers to both support multiple isps let alone justify infrastructure upgrades companies dont randomly put massive infrastructure projects in the middle of nowhere they go in areas that generate the most amount profit if net neutrality didnt exist companies and individuals pay more money making the overall market bigger this means isps can now pay for not only upgrading there networks but the hope is that the overall market size grows enough to the point where isps can compete in each others areas and both still be profitable the negative consequences towards consumers and businesses in my opinion are overblown while the law is not yet defined the lack of net neutrality can go ways the first is isps will prioritize data for higher paying customers lets stop and think about what this really means one of the key oppositions to this point of data prioritization is the fear that smaller businesses will be squeezed out of the market this simply will not occur heres why data prioritization impacts consumers and companies in two ways it is important to realize there are three tiers of internet service residential small business provides static ip address and direct internet access dia literally a direct link to an isp the differences being that residential services dont typically have a service level agreement sla which govern things like uptime and bandwidth connection speedsreliability business internet is more expensive because first they not only need a downstream to let customers connect to their website but they need also need to send data back to the consumer also by paying more businesses are guaranteed a level of quality in their sla so they dont have to worry about slow internet speeds and customers not being able to go on their website to purchase things residential internet on the other hand is oversubscribed which means that it might get slow if too many people use it at once this occurs because isps to save costs switches aged infrastructure bandwidth limitations etc go with best effort stipulation it basically means that hey the internet speed will be what we promised for like of the day but for probably between when everyone gets home and streams stuff at the same time youll have slower internet oversubscription isnt supposed to happen your ideally meant to get the internet you paid for maybe even gigabit speeds if your lucky isps constantly change their access to meet demand but from their side it just doesnt make sense to spend the money on constant infrastructure improvements when they can say hey of them time it works all the time perfectly at speeds you paid for ill explain how paying for internet speed is already similar to paying for data prioritization in a second but first lets focus on the actual prioritization part itself so the concept of data prioritization and paying for it somehow just irks people the wrong way in reality itll make content faster reliable and less bloated i liken internet data traffic to two imaginary pipes with packets flowing in and out one pipe represents the consumer viewing content and the other pipe the business website your trying to link to currently all traffic is treated equal great but what if i told you that internet video makes up of all traffic that means someone in your community that watches netflix streams nfl etc really hog up the bandwidth in the pipes leaving less room for everyone else and often times causing oversubscription to the network theres two fixes for this first data prioritization or second getting bigger pipes data prioritization refers to the packets flowing in the pipes and the actual pipes themselves represent bandwidth speeds currently the pipes are shared which leads to network congestion you can request bigger pipes sure by increasing your internet speed but in reality unless a lot of people in your community do it as well it will only increase the oversubscribed cap by a small margin to accommodate to truly build a larger pipe means digging stuff up and laying more cable which is a far more expensive process that would costs tens of thousands of dollars data prioritization is a superior fix it means either a consumer or business pay for the amount of space in in the pipe if a gigabit pipe is laid for a small neighborhood houses data prioritization and paying more for it means that a customer may buy of the capacity of the pipe at any given moment ensuring they are not effected by network congestion of their neighbors using netflix or whatever basically it forms a sla with the isp and youll get the speed you paid for assuming the company on the other end also prioritizes their pipe which they already more or less do now on the companies side they already have an sla agreement with the isps data prioritization effects them a bit differently their pipes can already accommodate all their data the problem is that when it reaches the customer pipes that companies like netflix youtube really hog them up as video uses of the pipe because all internet must be treated equally loading small pages take much longer because of network congestion it makes sensefeasible for companies especially ecommerce websites to pay to let their content load before netflixyoutube for them loading a single website maybe but a video on netflix is or more assuming the consumer on the other end doesnt have data prioritization small data companies can pay to load their data to the customer at quicker speeds in congested networks feasibly if netflix or youtube tried to do this for all their data i doubt theyd be able to afford it so instead they will just use whatever capacity of the pipe is leftover

technology,removed,basically thats the jist the article doesnt say what exactly theyd sue over just that att has said theyll likely litigate and this is the most common means of litigation in this situation and its what att has litigated over in the past elsewhere that being said the contracts that they are suing over that give them the right to sue are basically contracts that effectively render true competition impossible by making it impossible for competitors to use the utility lines used by the litigator att in this case in short att is saying were gana sue you for breaking our governmentally sanctioned monopoly by allowing other people to touch your stuff when you said you wouldnt do that the contracts shouldnt have been written in the first place their legality is going to be called into question in this type of suit and hopefully the original contracts can eventually be voided so the city can do whatever the fuck it wants with city property without having to ask a corporation nicely first
technology,removed,i think its a number of factors changing technology in general newer components newer solutions appear that exceed the potential for current methods etc for example google fiber was hinting that they would go away from actual fiber and start looking at wireless gigabit internet which overlaps into their google fi space and bypasses the arduous task of building out terrestrial fiber hardware considering how many states are fighting telecom and internet service providers in court it makes sense of course people who have fiber or are considering it are rightly worried this might mean a disruption in their service another example i can think of is the nexus tablet which shipped with a known driver issue with their graphics chip which caused the tablet to spontaneously lock up and reboot for months the issue went unresolved and google started endorsingpushing the nexus tablets followed by nexus google glass was seeing continuous software revisions and they even announced new hardware versions before it seemed to halt overnight the device became more of a niche piece of tech and while theyre finding really amazing uses for it from surgery and medical to helping autistic children understand facial expressions in people around them the project just seemed to be abandoned as if google lost interest project ara never even got off the ground but it had a lot of enthusiasm and support from people in the tech industry open architecture portable devicesphones with swappable modular components pc building but its a phone i think a lot of times google creates projects and products just to show how easily they can but once they reach they seem to give up maybe its money maybe its adhd or maybe their purpose all along was to spur the market as they have successfully done in some places with google fiber

technology,removed,i wonder if this is all connected to something that happened in that all these breaches occurred i assume these state sponsored hackers are holding the data and trying to exploit every account however this year there seems to have been a lot of massive breaches from does this all come from one hack million yahoo accounts could be connected to at least a few million of the linkedin accounts i would assume maybe not as many as was actually compromised in the dropbox and linkedin and breaches but still did the hackers find a yahoo employees credentials from linkedin and exploit it in the same way dropbox was hacked
technology,removed,and if att is defending their extremely evil monopolistic parasitic business practices with a technicality then they are a shitty company run by subhuman filth that the world would be better off without and if you are defending their use of technicalities youre no better good day
technology,removed,not all of them its very simplistic and onesided to view ads as just that
technology,removed,question is will he suicide himself times in the back of the head like that one guy or barbell himself to death like the other guy
technology,removed,sorta like just blanket calling trump supporters racists
technology,removed,to be fair the chaney thing was that guys fault when you go hunting for birds like that your whole group is supposed to walk in one line and only shoot ahead of that line the guy who got peppered with birdshot was way in front of the line so chaney shot where he should have the guy was standing where he shouldnt have been meaning chaney now had to put up with a bunch of bullshit hit pieces in the press about how hes just running around shotgunning people in the face so the guy who fucked up rightfully apologized to the guy he fucked over
technology,removed,is that why there have been massive threads to switch to ublock origin because abp started taking money to let non obtrusive ads through yeah we all block ads because we dont want to see them
technology,removed,the overwhelming majority of content is shit and there just as a platform to serve ads i can live happily without it also before the ad model took over the internet there was plenty of content to suit me
technology,removed,i hate advertising as an industry its invasive and its entire purpose is to try and manipulate people some cities have banned billboards and outdoor ads as its so intrusive and uglyi find the internet the same way when i use someone elses device that doesnt have a blocked its frustrating and slow and very unpleasant
technology,removed,look at the music industry the only way they could get the average joe to put any money back into the industry fuck right off you shill albums by justin beiber etc have been making more than ever absolute fucking tripe are they suffering if they were theyd give up some of their millions in profit to support the art id give up millions if i had it
technology,removed,you are missing the point most sites exist to host ads they arent serving anything of real value your blog where you wax about the deplorable state of video games isnt important to me the storefront you put up to simply drop ship me something i can get directly isnt important to me you offer no value you need to pay writers because nobody will go to your site just to click an affiliate link or watch ads you have to put something their to trick them into bothering we arent talking about hard hitting journalism or a charity that helps millions when we are talking about the overwhelming majority of websites
technology,removed,why would any site tolerate an ad company with loose standards this can be answered in only one character
technology,removed,some days you just want to be angry at everything and nothing at the same time
technology,removed,i use ublock for the same reason i only have netflix and internet i dont want to see ads and no i dont care about their ad revenue edgier than bismuth yes i know

technology,removed,that system doesnt actually solve anything at all its better than previous attempts but still a terrible idea the presenter says votes cant be hacked wtf wheres his evidence for that whats to stop a hacker from falsifying the website display so that it looks like your vote was allocated correctly but has actually been diverted elsewhere behind the scenes you couldnt prove it at the individual level the only way to check would be to perform a largescale audit but with all the paper slips having been destroyed you cant do that anymore this would be a trivially simply deception once you gain access to the system itself im loathe to think what more creative minds could come up with the whole point of anonymised voting is that noone else can influence you against your will but if citizens leave the polling booth with a literal receipt in their pocket that can be checked online at anytime then they absolutely become vulnerable to that very risk schoolsemployerspolitical partiesknitting associations could all coerce you to disclose your vote before allowing you entry have an excellent video on why any form of electronic voting as we currently understand it is a bad idea
technology,removed,not good enough to play it on a good emulator with ntsc filtering a big screen and a comfy couch apparently
technology,removed,publish the hash of voting results in all major news outlets youre not actually solving the problem though youre just abstracting it another level outward in this scenario everyone has to implicitly trust the software thats generatingchecking the hash under the assumption that it wont be compromised which of course it could be theres a billiondollar industry in it is the problem of having to trust voting machines and counters worse than crimes related to coercing yes because we know they cant be trusted we have documented evidence of them being modified or just plain erroneous to begin with the magical assumption that this system will somehow just work and everyone should trust it is a fantasy that can be controlled with strict laws asking for the receipt should be a felony yes just like other laws have successfully eliminated all other crime too

technology,removed,so you missed that whole big thing where there is proof that he appointed people as ambassador to foreign countries in exchange for donating millions to the clinton foundation the front for a criminal enterprise or hey how bout that whole thing where obama was caught using his appointees holder lynch comey to sidestep the legal process in all the investigations against clinton plenty more not sure what else people want clinton is a fucking criminal but hey trump said he likes pussy years ago so no big deal eh i mean at least trump only talks about grabbing some pussy hillarys husband routinely did it while president

technology,removed,lol so then what do you make of this or the fact that hillary clinton actively threatened humiliated insulted and intimidated all of these women for years and years i guess having a private conversation with the guys about sexual assault is disqualifying for a republican but covering it up and victim blaming is perfectly fine if its a democrat is that the little chat we are having
technology,removed,are you sure you have ibs because man it doesnt even matter what i eat ill still have the worst shits but not until after cripplingly painful constipation of course
technology,removed,a general rule of thumb is that or less of your posting and conversation should link to your own content ive posted of my own links about words each and my accounts comment section has about posts and comments total with the majority being lengthy ones eyeballing at words total exceeds even the total length of the content of my links you should not vote up only things from your domain or project didnt do you should not ask for votes on reddit even on your twitter or blog or forum didnt do you should join subreddits that are relevant to your interests talk about issues that interest you and be a good member of the community did do comments are mostly in asklearn programming responding to novice programmers i am also an active contributor to several open source projects which we can agree makes me a good member of the general programming and tech community you should check your domain page from time to time and participate in the comments if people have questions or comments about something youve done did do if people historically upvote your links or ones like them and were talking about real people here not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you congratulations my post link about things i learned about fonts while writing an open source font library got upvotes and my link got upvotes if nobodys submitted a link like yours before give it a shot but dont flood the new queue submit one or two times and see what happens my link had content that wasnt like previously submitted links i also transparently noted that i had deleted my first post on the link shortly after because i was worried there were too many holes in my argument but gained the confidence to leave it up today in conclusion no u

technology,removed,okay and now what what are these people to do never upgrade never buy another computer get a mac maybe theres a fantastic operating system out there called linux there are many versions out there a lot of them are just as easy to install and use as windows if not more so instead of screwing you over and doing all kinds of stuff under the hood that is not in the users interest it empowers you and gives you the keys to every single aspect of your system if you so desire it has tons of superb games granted not as much as windows and more than enough industrial strength software to cater for pretty much every user out there of course if learning stuff intimidates you and you value familiarity above all else you will have to start using windows sooner or later windows are designed to have a finite lifespan itll stop working someday dont kid yourself you cannot sue microsoft because they refuse to make a new windows that doesnt grant them direct access to every single detail of your private life manifest

technology,removed,can you describe to me in apolitical terms how this is different from clinton im mildly interested no troll
technology,removed,its strange that the emails might happen to be on the manassistants electronics and the husband just happen to be investigated for child pornsexting i mean its not the first time someone was framed for child porn but it would give them a legal reason to search the devices

technology,removed,propaganda doesnt have to be untrue its just using information strategically to influence thingsusually misleadingly my problem with assange is he is defacto helping trump by focusing solely on hillary he hates hillary and the usg for what they have done to him so is using this to get his revenge he doesnt give a shit about what problems he causes or how the american people suffer as a result this is him lashing outits not about truth or right he doesnt give a fuck about that

technology,removed,you responded so you care
technology,removed,correct right now they can argue that the revenues are not taxed and therefore can have a claim on the taxes if ireland must receive the full tax amounts the us loses out because a conpany cannot be taxed twice on a particular stream or revenues profits
technology,removed,for anyone asking if the usa part is true is a german article about it saying that america is threatening europe to not close the tax holes
technology,removed,to be fair to the us theyre the only country besides eritrea that taxes its citizens who live abroad too there are are agreements with a handful of countries but everywhere else americans can have to pay taxes twice on the same income if theyre selfemployed or make over
technology,removed,actually no you still have to pay an exit tax as if you had sold everything you own
technology,removed,if ireland wasnt in the eu this wouldnt be an issue and what they have done seems to be legal youre right thats literally how laws work if its illegal to be a retard in somalia but you live in the us guess what its not an issue unfortunately for apple they are the retard living in somalia so it does matter
technology,removed,you are lucky because otherwise you would lose your largest tax payer because otherwise they would be somewhere else paying another countrys taxes
technology,removed,apparently women drop their phones a lot because most womens clothing has either poor or no pockets at all which leads to a lot of knocking them off counters and falling out of pockets in my wifes case despite years of hurling it onto concrete dropping it down the stairs and pouring coffee on it her iphone in its badly damaged phone case still hasnt got a scratch on it
technology,removed,thatll buy the us a couple of missiles and tanks first dont be a prick in ireland it would revamp our entire rail system or give every single person fast broadband or buy a dozen tickets for the next olympics second no you wont you will use it to pay down the debt you accumulated during your bailout as commanded by your overlords in brussels

technology,removed,the amount of people across the ios macos and computer teams that would lose their jobs over the shit theyve let through to the public since his death would be astonishing if he was raised from the dead he was extremely meticulous everything had to work perfectly in his eyes and had to be intuitive heads would roll

technology,removed,racialethnic targeting can be a powerful and useful tool different races have different shopping preferences and it makes sense for advertisers to be able to target markets which are more likely to buy their product thus increasing the value of a dollar spent on advertising however if people start abusing this by excluding certain races from job ads or housing ads then its blatantly illegal the fair housing act of and civil rights act of protect against such discrimination
technology,removed,wasnt that roughly a few years after cbs bought them
technology,removed,youre rewarding the behavior of the advertiser by giving them free publicity
technology,removed,piss off you criminal traitor why dont you talk to your buddy putin about that
technology,removed,those autoplays are also giving me a headache and they are on many sites these days i already have limited data
technology,removed,i would not claim this to be a racism or even sexism thingbut more a targeting thing when we showed facebooks racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer john relman he gasped and said this is horrifying this is massively illegal this is about as blatant a violation of the federal fair housing act as one can find the fair housing act of makes it illegal to make print or publish or cause to be made printed or published any notice statement or advertisement with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference limitation or discrimination based on race color religion sex handicap familial status or national origin violators can face tens of thousands of dollars in fines

technology,removed,the something that isnt adding up is that everyone thinks apple always follows policy and that anyone who claims they didnt is lying because people love to blame victims and believe in the just world bullshit i have been fighting with apple for years over a lemon machine they know its a lemon they got sued into admitting its a lemon but they still wont do the right thing they know people mostly dont have the resources to fight a legal case

technology,removed,it amazes me that were even having this conversation when the problem as you described is already a solved one people are idiots
technology,removed,you have no clue what youre talking about i dont have time to explain it to you but watch that video which constantly gets passed around on reddit
technology,removed,unless the eu invents a new internet really why dont we this ruling cannot be applied
technology,removed,oh no youve found the one fatal flaw that can never be overcome thank you for telling us we can pack it all up noe and call this automation thing off thank you for your valuable comment
technology,removed,whats to stop them from doing that now you dont seriously think the ups driver would fight them off do you
technology,removed,what if its not a family member
technology,removed,most of that risk comes from taxi services at night when people are drinking not during the day
technology,removed,it beeps at you
technology,removed,you seem to have some actually a lot of misconceptions about how electric cars or just cars in general work ill try to answer and clear it up instead of just downvoting like everyone else i still dont quite understand how you could charge a battery that is capable of a maximum output of kwh to life but only have it charged to power disabled from unlocking full power in an absolute dire situation as discussed kwh kilowatt hour is a measurement of the battery capacity the equivalent on a gas vehicle would be the size of the gas tank the output is always the same imagine your car came with a gallon gas tank but had a valve installed that only allows you to fill it to gallons thats basically what tesla is doing with the vs kwh models in terms of ethics if there is no way the vehicle could achieve that extra power in that moment due to a lack of upgrade its really just an unfortunate thing and is tantamount to going for the cylinder option over the cylinder option at your dealership in lieu of costits still a good engine it just didnt have the grunt to help you out in that rare moment where a little extra power separated you and your family from doom there is no extra power provided from having a kwh battery instead of a kwh battery whether you run out of electricity or you run out of gas you wont be able to perform evasive maneuvers that aside electric cars have all the torque available all the time you dont have to shift gears or accelerate to the optimal rpms to move theres never that awkward pause when the engine slows as you shift to a higher gear
technology,removed,time to get jacking chummers
technology,removed,is there to your knowledge such an option for extra power as dlc nope at the time of purchase you choose between single or dual motors and thats all the power you will ever get checking now it seems as if tesla has actually removed all mentions of horsepower from their site for some older models there was an option to retrofit with ludicrous mode but that involved actually taking the car to a shop and getting new hardware installed im not sure if this is still available as an afterpurchase upgrade
technology,removed,can i sli my car
technology,removed,i never said people dont drink during the day i said the greatest risk of someone vomiting in your car is during the night
technology,removed,youre welcome idiot
technology,removed,youre a fucking idiot
technology,removed,because they are all owned by jews
technology,removed,you have cameras locked doors insurance etc theres so many simple ways to solve the problems that people are saying in this thread like driving in snow its not perfect but it doesnt matter you can automate half the country that does have snow and then by the time you done that the tech will be good enough for the other half so many people acting like this could never work just because its not perfect for everyone right now
technology,removed,the point is there are going to be many more jobs lost than jobs gained no one is saying literally every job will be automated but enough of them will be that itll cause mass unemployment
technology,removed,lol thanks for proving my point zealot theres a difference between providing a barrier which exists in computers like antivirus etc and completing taking an boneheaded absolutist stance on making sure data cant be decoded at all

technology,removed,this is similar to microsoft saying you cant use ms word to write novels for sale through amazon or bn only through the microsoft book store coming soon microsoft already does effectively this if you buy office home or personal editions you are explicitly restricted from using it for commercial purposes ie writing a book for sale from the microsoft httpdownloadmicrosoftcomdocumentsusetermsoffice the servicesoftware may not be used for commercial nonprofit or revenuegenerating activities if you want to use microsofts products to make money you have to pay for the more expensive commercial editions tesla is doing the exact same thing ensuring those who want to use their products for revenueproducing functionality pay more for the opportunity to do so
technology,removed,should is a loaded word that implies some higher power needs to sanctionprohibit certain behavior in a free society i would like the ownercreator of a product to be able to monetize it in any way they see fit let consumers decide if personal use included restrictions apply for commercial use is a model they prefer tesla is being very upfront about their rules theres an argument to be made if they were burying this restriction in a lengthy terms document you didnt see until you take delivery but thats not the case here

technology,removed,caps hold that peak demand down thats how usage costs them charging by the byte is dumb i dont think they should do it and i think the reason why they want to do it is greed but again that doesnt mean that bandwidth is infinite once again again not trying to shill for comcast but promoting this idea that unlimited bandwidth costs them nothing is counter productive they can easily show that unlimited bandwidth does cost them where they put their thumb on the scale is when they say they have to have caps in order to allow everyone to have reasonable speed we both know that what they really mean is that theyre capping downloads so they dont have to spend the money to upgrade and maintain their network to meet demand it would make more sense to say that theyre making more than enough money so that they have no need for caps other than profit the bonus there is that when you say that its also true
technology,removed,still not disagreeing that bits are free and thats still irrelevant you can keep pretending thats what im saying but its still not the case im still saying this again not trying to shill for comcast but promoting this idea that unlimited bandwidth costs them nothing is counter productive they can easily show that unlimited bandwidth does cost them where they put their thumb on the scale is when they say they have to have caps in order to allow everyone to have reasonable speed we both know that what they really mean is that theyre capping downloads so they dont have to spend the money to upgrade and maintain their network to meet demand it would make more sense to say that theyre making more than enough money so that they have no need for caps other than profit the bonus there is that when you say that its also true

technology,removed,im done with you no youre not thats why you are still replying here are just a few articles from different sites all talking about why data caps are bullshit translation i cannot address the points you brought up or articulate my own opinions very well so here are a handful of articles i googled i implore you httpgetaolcomplansdialupinternetphp there are no datacaps and it is vastly cheaper than comcast that or you should stop downloading too many moviesporn from torrent because comcasts datacaps are currently set at and i dont believe even for one second that there is anyone is going over that limit with normal usage that doesnt include illegal pirating you are a paid shill or are just a straight up asshole obviously just wants to try and tear anyone whos anti data cap apart said the person with the maturity and foul mouth of a

technology,removed,the problem with telcos is that customers arent given the information they need to make an informed decision you can be almost sure what theyre saying publicly is only a fraction of the truth the reality with failed regulators who drink their kool aid isps make it almost impossible for you to compare your current service with another provider they do this by bare bone descriptions about the speed of your connection ie mbps and data quotaslimits that make little to no sense because there is no context what does gb really mean along with ambiguous acceptable use policies the pricing constructs are subject to what sort of telco youre connecting with are they vertically integrated what is their scale do they own their network do they run data centres with peering and interconnects with popular services take akamai if you have one of their cdn boxes in your data centre it will cost next to nothing to transfer petabytes of itunes ms patches content to your customers like were talking about for the rack space and no charge on the usage at the wholesale level if you divide the total usage out of that service by its monthly cost youll find that the cost per mb is like so data caps excess charges and unlimited products are just marketing tools they make almost little to no sense when trying to match it back to a telcos actual costs the best way to understand this situation is through examples some telcos are simple resellers they own very little infrastructure just a brand really their billing is done by a third party as is the provisioning and their network is obviously supplied by a supplier these resellers buy capacity and connections and then oversubscribe the concept contention ratios are way of dividing the number of customers and the total amount of bandwidth you need to supply to them against the total amount of bandwidth youve bought to supply them so if you have customers with mbps services that means you need to supply of bandwidth but your telco wont do that no way why because even at per mbps its per month which wont be recovered seeing those customers are at best paying per month so you obviously youre not going to make enough to pay the bandwidth and plus your other costs so what this means they oversubscribe usually a good telco is for every mbps theyll supply some telcos ive worked for are some even now customer usage is utterly dependant on what sort of customer base your marketing to internally youll find that only of your customers leachers account for like of your total bandwidth use the vast majority of customers out there simply dont use their internet all the time sure telcos can poorly manage it their networks they can buy substandard transmission they can prioritise traffic from higher margin corporate using a vbr qos causing traffic to cause ubr consumer traffic to become delayed or even dropped which can have a big impact on time sensitive applications like voip but at the end of the day they for the most part fake it hard by ensuring you have no idea where your data is coming from see technically you shouldnt have to pay more for traffic that is essentially coming from transparent proxies a key way we trick customers is we condition them like purposely full on pavlovian conditioning one company i worked for implemented shaping wed slow customers down by x depending on how much they downloaded in a certain period of time if you downloaded less your service would go faster but we never told them we were doing this this mechanism saw a significant reduction in network load which reduced costs because we didnt have to buy more wholesale transit another more subtle way was selling a service when in reality the layer one nature of the medium delivering the service the cable itself was of such a poor quality that the actual sync rate is and they varied depending on environmental interference and cross talk they make it very hard to know if its a server or client side issue anyway the big carriers like ive explained have a very low cost base because they have massive fibre networks with even larger amounts of dark fibre theyve inflated the cost of their services with other wholesalersresellers so as to give the idea that were still living in an age of scarity the reality is that in western countries there is so much fibre and the technology is upgrading so fast that basically everyone could have unlimited internet at for a small cost look at europe and asia where gigabit internet of this nature is already being launched countries like australia and the us have deeply nobbled regulators who have failed their citizens letting the telco bosses run rampant and look these parasites are making their way into the political arena in australia one of my former bosses is prime minister when i worked for him we worked in a sweat shop literally a warehouse with concrete floors doing tech support for dial up imagine an australian summer working in such a place with no ac working for the sort of bullshit money that americans think is acceptable these carriers are bullies and cheats ive seen then destroy billion dollar companies to protect their monopolies one case i calculated resulted in basically the public paying somewhere in order of billion extra for their telco services the regulators are weak and corrupted failing consumers in general theyve drunk deep from the kool aid the industry makes and allows for cartels to operate with impunity the media has also been deeply corrupted ive worked with senior management and the money they make is sickening they make merchant bankers look like monks when ive been let off the leash travelling meeting customers and putting fires out its been a junket of crazy proportions ive definitely had to walk away from two jobs due to the liver damagedrinking alone one thing i will say is that most of the articlesclaims from the telcos mix truth with lies subtle misinformation glossing over technical complexities and failing to explain context thats why a lot of telco employees who reply to these threads are often pedantic in their points and arguments but often dont have knowledge experience and high enough position to see the bigger picture

technology,removed,nothing whatsoever all it does is move the step where something has to convert the signal from digital to analogue outside of the phone ie the dac the converter that used to be inside the phone and of a reasonably high quality now has to exist outside the phone within adaptors and headsets you can take a wild guess at how many producers are going to add a significant amount of cost to add quality signal conversion to their products that has already shaved away production costs in using poor quality plastic and otherwise shit components thats right nobody and the producers of actually good headsets will never go away from the mini jack so everyone is stuck with either using the garbage that apple and their cronies are producing or buying an external dac an own device mind you about the size volume wise with a phone with a mini jack out and before you mention it bluetooth isnt fit for proper audio transfer loads of compression but hey its not like anyone cares its wireless not to mention the doesnt even come with which is supposed to have enough bandwidth to make audio devices usable it comes with a custom bt like system thats right apples own patent so they can extort anyone that wants to make wireless headsets that works with their devices this is quite honestly the scummiest move apple has ever made its sole purpose is to make money it has absolutely nothing to do with bettering the product for the consumer—its actually the quite opposite the customer was thrown under the bus

technology,removed,so the confirmation was from a single guy on an internet forum and the comment got deleted afterwards this is a big dont get hyped flag another thing to keep in mind is that peerreviewing doesnt confirm the results a paper being published doesnt mean its true and weve even had examples of completely bullshit papers getting through peerreviewing memory of water anyone however if their analysis and results get available to everyone it will allow other laboratories and research team to perform the same experiment and see if they can reproduce it
technology,removed,thats one theory but if that were really true he wouldnt need to seek legal relief from public use of strong encryption we can never give in to this argument they have other methods of data collection they do not need to decrypt our personal information to prosecute criminals theyll keep repeating the same crud over and over until people get bored and give in just say no

technology,removed,i dont understand how a judge could be ok with allowing email snooping on a very technical strict interpretation of a law so strict in fact that it renders the law almost meaningless the real world equivalent to this ruling would seem to be that its illegal for your mail carrier to read the contents of your letters while they are in the process of delivering them but perfectly fine for your carrier to read them once theyve been placed in your mailbox the letters are no longer in transit having already technically been delivered and thus not protected from laws covering the snooping of intransit mail

technology,removed,minutes on google got me this yearold list of attacks on american soil since dont look like fbi setups and before you say that somemostall of them are cases where the fbi was secretly involved which ill concede is not impossible for or lets think about some basic criteria for a likely fbi setup the perp was recruited into what they thought was a ring of terrorists that helped them plan the attack which turned out to be the fbi if a guy attacks people with a hatchet theres no recruitersuppliertrainer by your own logic it doesnt fit the mold the attack was prevented when they set people up its because they want to swoop in and be the heroes as you say it has to be a sting the law enforcement response was immediate and effective they want to show themselves to be competent the dc sniper attacks went on for weeks this type of thing isnt their style it just doesnt fit in some of these cases law enforcement and military were targeted militaryle culture is very tightknit and its unconscionable that they would target each other even if you put the moral angle of the act aside a conspiracy like that requires many participants and the risk of a single conscientious objector turning on them would be too great it just doesnt make sense the attack worked and people died especially if its lots of people id like to assume that the feds wouldnt intentionally kill people for cheap political points stranger things have happened but its not their typical mo look man there are plenty of cases of law enforcement entrapment im not denying that but your idea that all cases of domestic terrorism are attributed to the feds gives them way too much credit why do you think that both real terrorist groups and ordinary people are incapable of terrorist attacks

technology,removed,of cause warner bros did not pay pewdiepie for a positive game review i dont think you fully grasp the effect that a gameplay video from a big influencer like pewdiepie has a positive video is in effect a positive review arguably it is a review pewdiepie must merely experience the game and give an impression he doesnt have to give it a rating from to for it to be a review what they paid pewdiepie to do was a paid promotions which is perfectly legal as long as it is disclosed which it was intent is what they are being nailed for yes the title is clickbaity but even a stopped clock is right twice a day they intended to deceive viewers into thinking that it was an unbiased impression of the game had pewdiepie been allowed to give an honest impression instead of a contractually mandated positive one the it would have been less offensive the fact that pewdiepie basically acted as a corporate shill isnt illegal in itself its that it was unnecessarily deceitful
technology,removed,its something ive struggled with as well but i think i am finally forming an accurate hypothesis that captures much of the issue so you will often see claims taken from down thread like gamergate was really just an excuse to push bigotry and sexist harassment against female game developers or gamergate was born of outrage against corruption and cronyism in gaming media im going to disagree with both of these i dont think its actually as straightforward as it appears i dont disagree that gamer gate results in sexist harassment of female game developers but i dont think it is used to justify or excuse such behavior like i dont think gamergaters are coming at it from a perspective of how can i abuse women oh i know ethics video games journalism nor do i think that gaming media is corrupt at least no more than one would expect by looking at other industries or would warrent the level of anger i think it was something more like this there is a large gap between the cultureniche of the sort of indie game scene zoe co are part and the gamer the gaming journalism scene is far more disproportionally weighted towards the first this gap is what the two sides value in games one side places the most value on gameplay and one side places the most value what games do to the player fundamentally its a clash of sports vs arts whats the difference art whether it be a piece of music a painting or film is about the emotions and thoughts it evokes in the consumer what it makes you reflect on sports are not about this sports are about rules and systems and skill so are games sports or art i certainly remember a time in the and early when many people were arguing that games were most certainly art yet today we have a thriving esports scene so which is it well its both you have games as art you have games as sports much of the conflict in gamergate boils down to this depression quest is art call of duty is a sport gone home is art league of legends is a sport now to be clear this is not to say narrative art there are narrative driven games that are gamer canon but only because the narrative itself has rules and systems planescape would be such an example gamers deride walking simulators as not games for their lack of rules and systems artists deride games like call of duty for not making you think critically about the ramifications of all the murder your engaging in when games blend art and sports they can be received well by both sides undertale is an example of this an artistic game that also had good game play specops the line would be another example an fps that had large artistic elements so now how does this manifest as sexism well sportssystematizing are classically not rightly a masculine domain while artsemotion are more feminine so its not surprising that when gamers push back arts they end up hitting a lot of women similarly its not surprising that women find themselves more at home developing art games rather than sports games this also explains the clash with social justice art has a long history of being used as a lever for social progress sports not in the same way imagine if say the new england patriots said we dont feel our team is diverse to represent so we are going to replace several of our popular players with various under represented minorities here while getting more underrepresented minorities onto the patriots would be progressive i think its hard to understate how livid sports fans would be you would see a lot of anger towards these minorities would that make sports fans bigoted i dont think so rather its that to them player skill not player identity is the most important facet of a player for the the sports industry to suddenly start emphasizing player identity over skill would be a huge betrayal their would be vitriol thrown at the minorities both to signal that that sports fans dont value this and because sports fan might hold them responsible you see a similar push back as social justice enters gaming to gamers game play the rules the systems above all things are sacrosanct to artists not so much artists dont value literal not cultural rules and systems when artists start emphasizing the social progressiveness of their games they are signalling that they dont care about gamers core values take for example the trans character in beamdogs baldurs gate the hate about it isnt because gamers are transphobic its because baldurs gate is a classic systematizers game i shouldnt need to say more than to hit ac zero as a note you a similar tension in regular dnd too dnd as rulessystems vs dnd as theatre i would almost say that gamers anger towards beamdog and anger at other such things ghostbusters might be a similar example manifests out of something much like cultural appropriation taking a symbol or work of one culture and twisting it to push the values of another culture this is also what drives the gamers are dead gamers dont have to be your audience thing its about artists trying to push towards games as art so what is gamergate i think largely its largely an attempt to coalesc a gamer identity and culture seperate from that of the artists wrt games who had an earlier start its a schism and like any culture schism the two sides hate each other with a vegence and attack what each other values hence the attacks on the things valued by artists social justice gender race sexuality not because gamers are sexistracist and such but because they dont place prime value on these things in games to them that is not what games are about similarly the ethics in games journalism not because gamers are actually motivated by the ethical failures of gaming journalists but because such failures are a means to attack the hated enemy related much of what gamergaters call cronyism is just that the artists have a community a group and like any community they help their friends finally why did this all blow up with zoeeron i think the zoe post and the subsequent reaction by the gaming media was an awakening to gamers that there was a separate gaming culture out there that was tightly knit that didnt represent them so they needed to form their own really the two sides need to realize that they can exist separately that they dont need to be enemies and can in fact come together over works that embody the values found in both sides that a artsy game isnt a threat to gamers and that a tasteless shooter isnt a travesty but good luck with that

technology,removed,my point was that many nonamericans vote on those online polls id argue over half are not from the us
technology,removed,im pretty sure that there are some legal scholars who could argue that classified information that conceal constitutional crimesviolations fail fundamental test of what can be classified thats what you want to happen but not what would actually happen in a court of law the federal laws pertaining to the handling of classified information have absolutely no test for the merits of whats classified it doesnt matter whats written on the document it could be a document listing the commandments and if you mishandle that piece of paper it is entirely irrelevant whats written on it there is literally no clause anywhere in the constitution that even addresses the topic of classified material so theres no constitutional defense
technology,removed,rpolitics is overrun with paid shills it died down a bit when clinton lost and ctr didnt know what to do but it went back to shit right after they got their contract renewed
technology,removed,its only obvious if youre a shill or have been swayed by paid shills
technology,removed,fuck and may i add you
technology,removed,are you saying there should be a clause in the constitution that defines government information classification and the handling of documents that doesnt seem like something that should be in the constitution
technology,removed,the same law that applies to contracts also applies to classification which law are you referring to
technology,removed,i dont see how thats applicable your link is about freedom of speech of contracts you enter into what we are talking about is a federal law dictating how you handle government documents the content of the document is irrelevant according to the law so the freedom of speech argument doesnt legally apply at all

technology,removed,check out rbuildingtomorrowland if youre into this idea as a reality
technology,removed,op here for those unaware if you use an xbox every single game that you play has the ability to collect your voice data so even if you opt out of voice sampling in your privacy settings any game you play is able to collect your voice data if it is in the terms of service and guess who they are likely to hand that data over to microsoft for one selling it to third party data brokers and government agencies of course to the casual uninformed user i am sure this is a great way to improve your computing experience however i believe that the primary motives in making voice data mining applications more applicable to users is so that they can get more users to jump on to the bandwagon and use their applications to be able to data mine on larger and larger scales this sounds like very powerful technology none of the articles i read spoke of privacy protection i find it likely that they will have algorithms that will collect flag and continue to monitor your communications as well as your contacts communications if you discuss anything illegal with them or even infidelity this type of technology can be used to collect a massive database on everything about you
technology,removed,exactly thats what im asking for with rbuildingtomorrowland an ideal city is designed by the masses and reflects humanity rather than our current condition which is designed by the few to reflect their own ideals wallets trumps wall will save us
technology,removed,yeah that sounds like a good story in fact im actually writing a totally fictional novel about a guy who comes up with a foolproof method for killing liberals unfortunately requires a lot of digging around on the internet and analyzing the profiles of his likely targets
technology,removed,he had it for four months you sons o bitches the conservative propaganda parade has obstructed our government for working for seven years and eight months not six i hope you and your entire family fall into a vat of slowdissolve acid in a room with npr playing on the radio
technology,removed,and the last years were proof that democrats were proneutrality right have you heard about this thing called the nsa
technology,removed,i wish i had cancer so i could go on killing spree i honestly daydream about murdering trump and his cabinet i hate them more than i have ever hated anything
technology,removed,yes

technology,removed,thats the same archive the us is suspected to monitor yes
technology,removed,zing
technology,removed,he is a government shill thats all you need to know
technology,removed,not so great im glad you placed so much importance on it but they sometimes inadvertently bring good things out of what they do against fair competition welp found the shill
technology,removed,who bernie fuck your future sanders trump is infinitely better than a fucking socialist
technology,removed,a kick
technology,removed,fuck off shill
technology,removed,thedonald falls squarely into that very definition no dissenters or sjws is among the communitys rules—limiting who from the other side can post there from the getgo users are according to the new york times banned by one of the roughly moderators from thedonald subreddit at rates much higher than any other on the site for such grave offenses as expressing civil but dissenting opinions conversation takes a backseat to loyalty you mean its a circlequeef gollygee i wonder what subreddit td could possibly have gotten that idea from a safespace where people just laugh at other opinions and those who go against said circlequeef get benned for not agreeing with mocking people of certain politics races or genders what a mystery
technology,removed,the land of the free is now seeing more clearly than ever before how their own government endangers their freedom sad encrypt everything good luck
technology,removed,basically ublock is piggybacking of adblock except with the use of white lists must be good having somebody else fighting this battle for you
technology,removed,but the final straw for me was the forced updates i want a stable system and could get onboard with automatic updates if those updates were highly reliable but theyre not yeah thats a deal killer for me along with the start menu ads and cortrana i tried posting some serious criticism to the windows subreddit and got lots of crap for people who were obviously fanboys you can try the main windows sunreddit rwindows dont know how bad the fanboys and the shills are there though
technology,removed,ok trump shill
technology,removed,did you read the thread no you did not the op said he had to connect to the itunes app to reset his iphone the cat i replied to said android did the same thing i said android did not require desktop apps i didnt say ios did or didnt pay the fuck attention
technology,removed,so we have to get very very tough on cyber and cyber warfare it is a it is a huge problem i have a son hes years old he has computers he is so good with these computers its unbelievable the security aspect of cyber is very very tough and maybe its hardly doable but i will say we are not doing the job we should be doing but thats true throughout our whole governmental society we have so many things that we have to do better lester and certainly cyber is one of them
technology,removed,you can go to prison in china for using a vpn wtf
technology,removed,because apple rips their customers off while android delivers much more value
technology,removed,other websites are going to follow suit even if it doesnt apply to them people are willing to unblock facebook because theres no replacement for it theres no other social network w all your friends and family so people have no choice but to use facebook those crappy news websites and what not are going to think blocking adblockers also raises ad revenue by for them but thats not going to be the case because theyre easily replaceable and not unique the only reason it worked for fb was because theres no replacement
technology,removed,wrong
technology,removed,well were done here if you think an individuals freedom to choose should be handed over to the government you may actually be mentally retarded but at the very least well never agree on anything your suggestions are so convoluted and ridiculous theyd never succeed and if they did youd rob freedom from every citizen i find that repulsive thanks for the chat scary to see people like you exist
technology,removed,have you tried simply turning off the tv sitting down with your children and hitting them
technology,removed,no doubt
technology,removed,its a waste of time a constant nag and gets you addicted to little blips of dopamine from getting attention virtually nothing about it is meaningful or useful beyond having an interactive address book the only negative ive experienced after years free of facebook is having the yes i dont have a facebook no im not a freak conversation but most people dont care
technology,removed,is there anything stopping apple from open sourcing ios so that it could be installed on smartphones
technology,removed,source
technology,removed,ive read this whole exchange and i am so sorry that other guy just cannot comprehend what youre saying it is a very simple concept yeah uhstark you are correct me and my power user friends are not the target demographic however
technology,removed,well the initial break was because i didnt feel like getting blasted with pictures of the girl i had intended to marry with her and her new boyfriend i hadnt really felt all that inconvenienced by it before that but after a few months i just never felt the need to go back plus as you mentioned knowing my shit isnt being tracked is a huge plus
technology,removed,haha thanks man i am and now i know i can survive just about anything so it wasnt all bad news
technology,removed,as a joke
technology,removed,oh look its a nofap shill
technology,removed,ive never had a youtube ad get through go into ublock origins options and chose more lists to block
technology,removed,i think i just jizzed in my pants a little
technology,removed,shut your whore mouth i can finally forgive ea for cannibalizing many of my favorite games and turning them into shit i can be okay with their model of selling part of a game at base price and requiring double the cost for the full game via dlc why am i okay with this one they arent a monopoly two they learned from steam and provide really good deals for those who wait three when ever i need to call them they generally have excellent customer service its been a couple years tho and i think most support is done via chat now they only rip their customers off when they buy their games at launch comcast and att rips their loyal customers off
technology,removed,okay crazypants the use of this is just so ironic given the contex of this subjecti meanjustjust wow this is why the intel agencies can do what they doyou people are jsut too fucking stupid to get it hahaha oh man stay asleep you blue pilled sheeple
technology,removed,you should do them a favor and off yourself
technology,removed,how about you fuck off
technology,removed,your best option would be to find a gun and use it on yourself
technology,removed,i would like to remind everyone that ads are not evil i use ublock origin on all my computers but i think ads have a legitimate place on the internet without them many websites and services would simply not be able to exist google puts out quality services and their ads are in no way malicious i work for a marketing company and we work closely with google googles standards for ads are very high and it is not always the highest bidder who gets their ad shown often times it has to do with the quality of the information you send them this is so google can better match up those products with their customers searches and needs i dont want google telling me what to buy so i block these ads but many other people simply dont mind and actually like being shown these kinds of things they are not harmful and you will not get any malware from googles ads also the tracking urls that are attached to those ads dont care about you individually all the information is dumped into adwordsanalytics and marketing companies cannot go and search down individuals not that they have the time or desire to do so
technology,removed,with the power the kgbfsb just gained it will be able to erase those videos permanently subversion is treason i dont understand how president obama is allowing this

technology,removed,credit to datausage billing is a farce file a complaint with the fcc its a load of poo that heavy users degrade service the only time they have to do maintenance is when a switch breaks or they need to replace a trap at the node caps are just a way to nickel and dime consumers comcast is already under scrutiny and if cox starts doing t its only a matter of time before consumers accept it as part of everyday life file the complaint and make sure you raise the red flags about these kinds of practices
technology,removed,i just barely paid enough money for my groceries this morning any less and it would have been criminal
technology,removed,the shill is strong with this one
technology,removed,yes you fucking sand monkey usa all you fucks from outside are a shitlabor who cant even put together
technology,removed,shoo habibi i can smell your shitsmeared hands from here
technology,removed,you are an anti american company if you hire workers
technology,removed,bullshit there are plenty of skilled american techs i used to be one were just not willing to work for shit wages or deal with the job insecurity that comes with an employer being able to knife us in the back by importing hordes of dot heads from a world hell hole i changed careers and now work in a field where i dont have to deal with that risk
technology,removed,us gdp per capita read more carefully
technology,removed,american companies for american citizens
technology,removed,yeah cuz theyre illegal shithead plus hes only going after criminals who committed other crimes besides coming here illegally now anyway or are you advocating for rights too
technology,removed,you want illegal immigration youre ok with keeping marijuana illegal your against gay rights your for the tpp you are ok with the revolving door of politics law makers taking nice big paying jobs as lobbyists
technology,removed,it has more to do with obama administration selling country to hindus thats why many of the top world companies such as apple or oracle or microsoft are now ran by these brownshitskins
technology,removed,
technology,removed,i understand the internet pretty well and i am fairly certain there is a dire need for some kind of legislation related to cyber security and itll have to deal with privacy somehow theres the fundamental problem that customers can be bad actors and some customer data can be used to detect bad actors in other areas if i know the username of fleeb flooberson logged in from a specific ip address always tries these sql injection exploits im going to want to share that customer information with someone right what does legislation have to say to make groups like yours okay with that scenario
technology,removed,because you cant just cherry pick the good things and only talk about them that isnt trump hes an unintelligent moron thinks vaccines cause autism thinks he knows more about isis than the generals thinks global warming is a chinese hoax etc
technology,removed,yeah but you also get a freaking trump presidency id take att in my anus any day of the week over years of trump in my pussy
technology,removed,crazy
technology,removed,oh meh
technology,removed,i also work in information security and i know its currently hard to share intel between the us government and private organizations why is that so hard why cant it be easier
technology,removed,mmm no i think clinton is more likely to do it given that her obamas administration and the democratic party are accusing russias intelligence agency the gru of using wikileaks as a front for interfering in the election hacking into john podestas emails and other crimes remember that clinton has not denied any of the things that the project veritas videos have revealed nor anything revealed in the podesta emails
technology,removed,john oliver is already such a hillary shill it makes sense
technology,removed,boooo shill
technology,removed,he wants to ban porn gtfo
technology,removed,honest question do you really believe im a shill tho
technology,removed,you dont know how any of this works so no that wont happen
technology,removed,not if trump wins they wont
technology,removed,the russian hackers state sponsored most likely the us hackers are anonymous individuals
technology,removed,i think that kind of persona comes with the position within the company seems all the top brass in companies have that going for them
technology,removed,its ridiculous att has a constant paranoia about being a dumb pipe ignoring the fact that they make butt loads of money theyre upset that other people can make money over their pipes and they dont get that money its as if the road department was upset that you can buy groceries that drive over their roads they want to be robber barons
technology,removed,the problem is the word shill is generally used to mean i hate you and youre wrong usually shill accusations are just flaming and stifle discussion ive been accused of being a shill just because i actually support clinton god forbid ummso the answer is to ban people for using a word thats a bad precedent and look what its turned rpolitics into cir
technology,removed,whats it like to be a shill for killary does it pay well is the money taxed or are you paid under the table
technology,removed,hey person just so you know the quote is satirical and done in jest the scary thing is that our reality is slowly turning into a punchline
technology,removed,oh hey satan
technology,removed,dont need to i live in a country where we have real competition
technology,removed,i had more trouble with apple than i have any other brand in the years i used them i know its anecdotal and people will believe what they want to believebut before and since apple my cost and support time is much less and the experience i had with them over years and products is why i left them despite liking the os at the time
technology,removed,that business model doesnt work anymore because all the content is owned by their competitors now but now that they probably have the best database in the world on viewers movietv preferences its a smart idea to transition into content creation
technology,removed,check out the post history this person is a shill for netflix

technology,removed,its not a netflix original they just let you stream it its a bbc programme that they had no part in creating they might get to list it as such in the us but they played no part in its creation all the other shows discussed here are shows they helped create dont tell people they dont know about something and then demonstrate little understanding yourself
technology,removed,hey mr netflix shill can we make netflix in the uk generally better and fix the shitty ui and add proper search functions especially for tv shows dont lump them all together and i dont want the same movie to appear in different genres when i search because that defeats the purpose a big alphabetical list of titles would be great not the silly little tiles
technology,removed,yes thats how it works they could have chosen a different wording but they didnt
technology,removed,two generations of laptops with defective gpus that took class action lawsuits to get addressed neither was actually fixed but just had more defective parts put in overheating issues claimed water damage and refusal to cover repairs because the indicators had changed color on devices that were never near water defective home buttons defective chargers and cables updates bricking or rendering approved products useless countless hours on the phone with every level up to executive relations with lots of people acting nice but never actually solving anything i have ten year old toshiba and compaq laptops running linux that still work great and never had a problem other than being slow due to age the premium was not worth it the only thing i miss at this point is the touchpad and gestures as mbps do have that cornered
technology,removed,is he living in a render of a house
technology,removed,yeah literally only way to get downloads unfortuneately are free apps with ingame transactions i use to have a paid game but made it free until my apple membership runs out
technology,removed,automated big rigs are so far in the future that im sure someone can easily make a way to create automatic fuel stations
technology,removed,id buy iwindows that can detect bricks being thrown at them where they extend robotic arms catch the brick mid air and fuck it back at the person who threw its face
technology,removed,the top apps on my phone are a rubiks cube app and star realms yeah mobile gaming is shit
technology,removed,tablets are perfect for board games and card games i just wish there were morebetter polished apps for them i tried out a suburbia one thats a great board game and its nice to have the computer do bookkeeping for you but its got some bad bugs
technology,removed,too bad civ is so heavy its not going to make it to mobile for a while
technology,removed,ive got a few external batteries its not too bad to use them because you can just plug your phone in and throw it in your pocket to top it up while youre out
technology,removed,i mean it sucks but theyre just following what the market wants
technology,removed,honestly ive never played it online i have a physical copy for when i feel like playing against someone
technology,removed,rprojectfi
technology,removed,i use a few apps regularly reddit for fun and tunein radio i have a few other apps that i use once in awhile im not opposed to having apps im just picky
technology,removed,that sounds like a bit of a chore
technology,removed,we cant have social healthcare or education because thats wrong and not with my taxesbut we spend billions on shit like this over and over and its always the same america has fucked priorities
technology,removed,this seems to be the fate of anything good anymore the internet in general has become this way the majority of the content online is useless shit put there just to serve ads or monetize something while adding no value
technology,removed,you are missing the point americans dont want to pay for social programs that we do spend that much on healthcare is irrelevant as it doesnt get us what the rest of the first world gets for less and americans resist social healthcare vehemently on the other hand americans by in large dont resist spending on warring
technology,removed,most conservatives would argue with this quote as being pussy liberal talk before they found out who said itthen they would make excuses
technology,removed,hi humorous im kickedc
technology,removed,if im shuffling a whole deck thats one thing but with the computer doing turns games go really fast
technology,removed,and out come the military hardware fan boys probably paid shills to defend this program
technology,removed,with that attitude nothing will ever change because everyone will keep saying well we have to do it because they do
technology,removed,i should be paranoid about hackers putting malware on my computer but i cant use vpnssh connections to prevent hackers from putting malware on my computer because that involves encryption
technology,removed,like i saidthere is always an excuse and using things like isis as an excuse is rich since they exist as a direct result of american warring in the middle east
technology,removed,pro establishment paid shill fuck you
technology,removed,pro establishment paid shill fuck you
technology,removed,firstly everyone is moving to usbc not micro usb so you clearly dont know what youre talking about wtf are you talking about i was talking about the existing connector that is on almost every android device ever made if you think apple are only keeping lightning for revenue youre an idiot think how much more they could generate by creating a usbc dock and making everyone buy it lol youre arguments are dumber than you honestly every single product they sell is for revenue and they keep it for that reason they license it out to other companies as well they have the lightning dock and its not a big seller and everyone doesnt buy it make an argument that makes sense they make a ton of money off the shitty cables they make that need to be replaced often and all other lightning products and the licensing its not as much as what they would make on a single product the dock but youre saying the only reasons they sell lightning is for that money theyd still be getting that money if they were selling usbc cables you complete moron its funny when the dumbest guy in the room you calls others a moron why because you are once again not thinking just talking like an idiot please explain why else would they create the lightning connector if they used usbc yes they would sell cables probably less but that doesnt matter so much they wouldnt make all this money licensing it do you know what licensing means jesus you have a big mouth but incredible small brain why should apple use usb just because everyone else is that is probably the dumbest part of your argument why would apple dump their equally versatile port thats on most of their products for a port than has no other benefits please explain why they should have not used it from the beginning im about to hear the dumbest part of all your arguments with your answer and why they shouldnt have started off with the connector everyone else is using like i said why use lightning when it has no benefits its to make money if you dont like the iphone you dont have to buy it the fact youre getting so worked up over products you dont need to buy is pathetic im getting worked up because im dealing with the dumbest guy on reddit you who thinks you are so smart you havent come up with one decent answer or explanation yet somehow you think youre right and so smart youre just an apple puppet you cant think for yourself the company tells you what to do or you work for them and still cant think for yourselfi mean you do spend every second of your day in the apple related subreddits actually the more i read the more i believe you work for them since you have so many of their products and all you talk about is apple products
technology,removed,i agree

technology,removed,i think we need a popular uprising against musk im thinking a diode stuffed with dynomite shoved up his ass
technology,removed,looks like a lot of paid big oil shills in this thread
technology,removed,purely focus on profit now i wonder how much they fucken make just on dongle alone
technology,removed,rofl so true
technology,removed,i havent really seen automation taking away everyones jobs ive seen outsourcing taking away everyones jobs either way universal income sounds good if it was mathematically possible to give people a living wage based on it but it cant
technology,removed,its not paying for you to do nothing its paying because whatever labor you was working in got overtaken by automation oh and you futurist utopian fanboys have it all figured out huh money doesnt grow on trees son grow the fuck up
technology,removed,you dont have it figured out youre living in a fucking fantasy dreamworld have you been dropping too much acid or what or is it too much anime and comic books
technology,removed,i like it
technology,removed,mfw year wait to get into disneyland but i can fuck a mermaid centaur hybrid with emma watsons face in the holodeck and then eat replicated bbq ribs till i puke
technology,removed,you wouldnt tax the robots but rather the output of the robots companies spend money on labor and assets automation replaces all the labor so there will likely be increased forms of taxing business assets
technology,removed,lol your work should give meaning and value to your life people naturally aspire for purpose mastery and autonomy not automation youre clearly one of those millennials that lives in the basement and totes an art degree but probably works at a bar nights a week
technology,removed,a big concern of mine is not that the lower level jobs will be automated which is true but that most of the middleupper class jobs will be automated as well artificial intelligence will dominate most white collar professions too further hollowing out the middle class further accentuating income inequality
technology,removed,one could imagine a solution similar to the way in which alaska shares its oil profits with the residents of alaska the alaska permanent fund fyi
technology,removed,in a world where virtually every unskilled job is done by robots we want to provide every citizen with enough money to live but not enough money to remove the incentive to work so enough money to survive but not comfortably
technology,removed,not to sound too occupyish but i believe it would be the or or something artificial intelligence does not exactly foster capitalist competition the first business to hit an effective ai system for their market will have such an advantage that no competitor will be able to compete robots will become so efficient and people so replaceable that income inequality will accelerate all the income streams will go to the top taxing the very top of the food chain more is the only feasible way to create this revenue
technology,removed,i agree that most people want to work but i disagree that most people want to work in a way that is conducive to maintaining our century lifestyles everyone wants to perform their labor of love but not many people want to be woken up in the middle of the night to replace power line transformers in the freezing cold a huge number of employees hate their boss despite their lack of qualification to do their bosses job and would leave the workforce for that reason i think we would have a lot of carpenters farmers and selfemployed individuals i definitely dont think people are inherently lazy but i really cant bring myself to believe that the number of crappy but necessary jobs would remain filled i also have trouble believing people would dedicate the same proportion of their lives to perfecting their work
technology,removed,actually this is economics present system present supply of goods limited supply of money goods compete for limited money via higher quality lower price proposed system supply of goods unchanged hopefully not lowered due to people not working to create them anymore higher supply of money in general population money competes for limited of goods ie massive inflation competition is actually the problem not the solution
technology,removed,fully automated luxury gay space communism
technology,removed,i agree the creative industry in general would benefit immensely from basic income what i think people dont see is the number of nurses mechanics electricians welders construction workers police and fire officers emts who would have chosen creative paths if they were confident money would be taken care of many existing jobs involve working for painintheass bosses or the general public even more painintheass and dont offer outlets for individual expression or creativity theyre souls draining the reason people do them is because in a competitive market those jobs help pay the bills eliminate the bills and not many people will volunteer for lifeshortening stressful jobs
technology,removed,as silly as that scene was that is a really important job anyone who works in software development will tell you that of project failures are not because the software itself if broken but because the problem it was designed to solve was the wrong problem correctly defining the problem is the most often screwed up part of the process ive seen it times the users dont understand the process fully they explain how the think it should work and the developers build exactly what they asked for without questioning it
technology,removed,at this point in the conversation were completely loosing touch of what money actually is the government pays everyone basic income and corporations significantly increase worker compensation who is generating the supply of goodsservices to cover all this im imagining in this world ceos executives are literal superhumans capable of working to support and sustain millions of highly paid lowlevel employees and everyone on the government welfare payroll
technology,removed,were not really controlling the amount of money since money is just a reflection of how much buying power you have relative to everyone else who has money in the same currency as you whats being controlled is the distribution inflation automatically corrects for the amount of money in circulation the real question is whether you can redistribute huge sums of money to the point people no longer have a survivalincentive to work and not crash the economy as far as im concerned the answer is pretty clearly probably not
technology,removed,that just sounds like slavery with extra steps
technology,removed,what i should have said in the comment above rather than just money is money in the hands of individuals intending to use it to purchase goods needed for a basic lifestyle
technology,removed,i appreciate your optimism but my experience hasnt been inline with your reasoning people dont like their bosses for all sorts of reasons beyond them being dicks some dont like their bosses decisions which often involve complicated balances between employees customers and business needs i have trouble seeing how there could presently be a hidden supply of managers who can better manage employee retention and theyre just not managers right now good managers especially in difficult positions are not easy to find
technology,removed,in that case do you think it would be better to spend some money to help people go to school or a ton of money to pay people regardless of what they do for what its worth i didnt mean to imply nursing is a bad job or soul draining necessarily just that its difficult and demands a lot of work beyond that honestly jobs like nursing take more than hours week to become proficient at if we dont want mistakes in hospitals we need a workforce that is dedicated and compensated one of the tenants of basic income people like to avoid is its primarily a strong redistribution system meaning we wont need any fewer nurses but because nurses are paid more than the average person their compensation under basic income will go down
technology,removed,the even better solution is to hire engineers who have so it skills and are well versed in requirements gathering thats the most pricey option but it makes for good results
technology,removed,hey samsung please place me on the waiting list in the burn unit
technology,removed,and their bad boss shouldnt be a reason i have to support them my boss is a meany head gimme money
technology,removed,perhaps i think that day is a further off than some others in this thread technology is amazing but so far not magic i think the transition period ifwhen something like that does happen will be very interesting similar to some scifi writers predictions i think initially there will be a lot of resistance from people who are being displaced perhaps even from people who prefer that humans have a hand in things there will definitely be resistance from people who previously made money from the replaced labor
technology,removed,are you a whiny twat that cant handle dealing with difficult people do you collect welfare you have the attitude to blend in nicely

technology,removed,no i was comparing business laptops to gaming laptops which are a much better value currently better than ram screen pcie ssd
technology,removed,i still have a functional genesis nomad im really tempted to sell it because they fetch a pretty penny on ebay my mind was blown when i saw that some of the auctions had twenty bids on them the only thing is that i think there is a problem with the dc jack on this unit but a competent electronics guy read not me could easily fix that people are even swapping out the old and crappy lcds with modern high qualitycontrast ones wonder how much that improves battery life
technology,removed,kill yourself
technology,removed,trump isnt an extreme republican either but that wasnt my point my point was that the two party system i know there are more parties but they barely get any sort of recognition makes it so that if you arent in direct opposition to the other main party you arent really seen as qualified to run it doesnt give space for that many nuances in views
technology,removed,sometimes but thats not true in this case the gaming laptops are built for just as much if not more stress on parts and have much better warranties available the extra price is because of the thinkpad name even the thinkpad doesnt include a pcie ssd doesnt have an integrated graphics card and the processor is far less powerful the hq verses the u on the processor makes a huge difference you would be paying more than double for a much lesser computer with a much shorter warranty by purchasing a thinkpad repairability theyre all the exact same longevity compare warranties reliability not according to the reviews on the lenovo thinkpad website when compared to the amazon reviews for any of the products i listed
technology,removed,if you think the benefits you listed justify double the price for less performance then you should certainly purchase the thinkpad for most people a thinkpad is not the most cost effective option for them
technology,removed,poor gavin

technology,removed,this is a the donald subscriber policy isnt their interest they just like shouting cuck at anyone who thinks women arent objects
technology,removed,if they are not free speech platforms nobody will use them of course they are legally allowed to do whatever they want reddit is full of people who make this argument as if anyone disagrees newsflash assholes everyone knows they are allowed to do whatever the point is that its bad business i feel the need to repeat this again just so people full understand this it is bad business to censor your user base if the purpose of your product is communication similarly it would be bad business to ban religious groups from your store the only one you hurt is yourself its bad business to take any political stand and alienate your customers if you are running a shoe store that would be retarded let me put this in terms people on default subs can understand the people complaining about this shit are their users its their customers this is like if someone buys a product and is not happy with it based on very well understood expectations then a flock of smug shitheads appear and go mmmmmm well you see theyre legally allowed to make whatever they want thanks assholes we know its just that in every other conceivable area of business people take customer complaints seriously

technology,removed,i have trouble understanding the point purpose and desire of people like who who make comments like this are people like you unaware that for any given discussion topic millions of people wont care about it do you think all these people should hastily open their mobile device to flood comment sections with their singlesentence expression of indifference how about this some people just like to know how things work behind the curtain is it problematic for you that people are interested in this do you take issue with people learning about how social media news trends are being manufactured by social engineers

technology,removed,how do you motivate as many people people to pick up trash or work a mine to fill the same workload in a way which is not money or a money substitute or equivalent to a draft where in between to you must work this then you get ubi and are allowed to get into the white city its already hard to make people want to work while being paid so how can i as an employer use your magic trick to get an employee to do the shit i want him to do right now but with minimum salary if i give them the equivalent of ubi the minimum like people are claiming here what magical difference would suddenly make them want to pick up shit frankly im not seeing it whats the incentive fulfillment why arent they fulfilled right now hows that you get ubi but you have to have a job hows that different than communism

technology,removed,so just because my parents and i have the same profession youre making the inferential leap to say that i was given my position via their influence a lot of lawyers have a hard time getting employment in their field so im going to say yes i live in the real world i know another guy who i think didnt have connections but he is big and tall so its possible the ambulance chasing firm liked that aspect about him the rest that i know usually had to have mom and dad pay for their office or are working bad legal temp jobs or something else what were talking about is a basic income not the means to production a social safety net it isnt communism it isnt kind of communism it isnt even close i dont consider someone to be intelligent if they cant figure out everyday euphemisms thats such a serious problem on the internet and tells you a lot about the sort of people youre dealing with you know what im talking about when i saw communism im not defending my phd thesis idiot if you think giving out free money to people is the solution to societys problems the institutions that gave you your high school degree college and law degree need to have their accreditation removed again theres no evidence to support that claim i dont know what workers of the world is but a cursory google says it is a labor union this post gave you away as being either a year old or someone who actually is in a socialist activist group how in the hell could you have a law degree and not have heard of these fuckers i knew i was talking to a phony please kid just fuck off and do your homework thanks

technology,removed,super pacs
technology,removed,if by limited you mean millions of civil suits and thousands of criminal prosecutions then yes limited and they only have to pass the imminent lawless action test for criminal cases since all the civil cases involve some sort of private contractual obligation maybe its not fair to include civil cases but certainly a great deal of them are down to confusion over what rights of expression a person signs away when they agree to a contract et cetera so it seems noteworthy beyond that you have the fairly large number of unlimited detentions without trial based solely on opinion or even so much as rumour based on secondary opinion and you have hundreds of us citizens rendered for extrajudicial detainment and torture based solely on opinion if you actually compare the thousandstens of thousandsmillions of people prosecuted for expressing an opinion in the us to the few people prosecuted in europe for the same its a bit counterintuitive perhaps because european countries have some seriously codified and well developed laws pertaining to freedom of speech the governmentlegal system is able to manage its limitations without mass tortureprosecutionlawsuit like the us

technology,removed,genuine question what do you do when you think a mod is shilling and just dropping the ban hammer on anyone who points it out and says otherwise not to mention i think mods forget theres an upvotedownvote for users to vote on what they believe and what they want to see but all i see is mods using the remove post button as their own little downvote button

technology,removed,thats the point you dont lose millions on a single windows desktop you can torch those if they act up for all everybody should care but a reboot is and has been so far in my professional career been the last possible effort when a machine is completely unreachable everything else is fixable without the uncertanties of a reboot and should be fixed that way

technology,removed,is there any motion via the mods to take the fight against groups like correct the record seriously surely you guys can at least take some basic approaches like accountactivity and other botsniffing efforts based on ips and such we know for a fact there are groups manipulating reddit but what we dont know is if a blind eye is being turned to some and not others because it agrees with narratives or other similar things that are shady
technology,removed,i dont blame you mods for being paid off to get rid of the post i wouldve taken the money tooyeah i saw the messagesinterview with a writer from huff post tomorrow

technology,removed,will any reply to this get removed

technology,removed,sorry what was it again you were saying you tell me to just google it but every google result is exactly what i say it is illegal to distribute or possess illegal numbers this isnt that hard or unbelievable a concept as its already a facet of law your misunderstanding is so inane that its hard to even try to understand how you could argue about it if i have a text file which is just a copyright protected work say the newest new york times best seller and i send it to someone i have committed a crime the numerical representation of this work is also illegal to transmit it doesnt matter if i converted the work to binary hex or anything else this is so basic that its almost impossible to imagine someone being as absolutely ridiculously stupid youre making an argument that essentially translating copyrighted material from one form to another and distributing or after a translation is somehow legal thats just so incredibly stupid that its unbelievable that you actually believe that

technology,removed,lg
technology,removed,a shit ton
technology,removed,thanks grandma bonzi buddy is now standard in windows
technology,removed,yes retard
technology,removed,this is really really similar to the outrage that swept across reddit when they killed the dvd drive in laptops years from now our phones wont have headphone jacks and people will have moved on i dont think apples current solution will be what ends up taking hold longterm but at some point the jack had to go it is a terrible design in this day and age and doesnt need to be the way we use devices i understand why people are upset but between us just using jacks forever or getting rid of them a little too soon i vote to do it early i want to see a universal standard pop up for audio that doesnt require a purposebuilt port
technology,removed,dangerous courageous cou·ra·geous not deterred by danger or pain brave
technology,removed,just to save apple some cost on builds no this is about apple making that wall bigger they cant control peripherals like the square reader on the headphone jack but they can force licensing and computer chips on the lightning port just like we already see with charging cables this means that they can suck money from anyone wanting to develop hardware for the iphone
technology,removed,its all based on tech developed in the us with software written in the us that intellectual property was sold to a subsidiary in ireland with no employees for pennies on the dollar and then the subsidiary sells the rights to use the ip back to the mothership in the us apple claims that this means the profits are in ireland not in the us
technology,removed,i dont even understand what the big deal is today you can buy lightning headphones for as cheap as ten bucks on amazon right now they have wireless bluetooth headphones for bucks whining about battery life i have chargers in my home car and office how long do people listen to music for without being anywhere near a power source cant charge and listen to music at the same time is that a common thing i feel at such a loss trying to relate to all the comments as someone who has submitted manyainsuranceclaim for water damage im just excited about the water resistance shrug
technology,removed,god youre so fucking anal
technology,removed,new macbook pros lol you mean ipad pros bro
technology,removed,oh god an extra cable at your desk how will you manage you people are seriously retarded and did you just say you dont use bluetooth because it uses so much power that it negates the car charger because if so you should get another car charger if im at i can have gps and bluetooth going in my car within a half hour ill be at an hour gets me back to
technology,removed,eeeexactly
technology,removed,i care
technology,removed,courageballs
technology,removed,thats not the point moron lets say tomorrow all gas station say we no longer do any gasoline and only sell kerosene and if you car doesnt accept it fuck you
technology,removed,yup but its super unprofessional to leave that shit in prod but then again ie is garbage
technology,removed,all of em
technology,removed,i wouldnt be surprised if thats somehow remedied soon i know i dont do that personally so the loss of an aux port isnt really bothering me but youre not the first person thats mentioned that they use headphones to fall asleep
technology,removed,im generalizing and you are the one who said we hate a product just because it has an apple on it no at least i dont hate it because of that i hate it because even tho its so blatant that its not something you as a consumer should be willing to buy because youre basically getting ripped off you still try to defend it over logical thinking but yes i guess i dont care if you spend every years hopefully in years the new iphone will just be a dildo so you can actually fuck yourselves with it at least you will find some enjoyment in it that way
technology,removed,not exactly stable legal or easy to do id much rather just pay the extra to get a macbook pro
technology,removed,literally all you did was puke vague anecdotes their devices have had objective improvements in almost every single aspect of what makes it a smartphone and ios is pretty widely regarded as one of the most efficient and stable phone operating systems on the market say what you want about them but your sweeping claim that their devices have gotten worse over time is just flat out incorrect its not really a matter of opinion here were talking numbers arent we theyve made all the numbers go up not down
technology,removed,the only drawback i see is the aux connector in your car then you dont see very much but to be fair most sheep dont considering youre obviously overlooking major issues such as compatibility with almost the entire music universe as well as the addition of yet another fucking battery to keep charged kind of makes you sound like another dimwit fanboy that thinks the sun shines out of apples ass
technology,removed,sounds like you really were using shitty devices and also either way out of date or more than years ago androids biggest issue is definitely the oems that bastardize it its only android you are experiencing if you are on a nexus device or one of a few other flagship devices in the last couple years otherwise youre experiencing a cell phone carrier and shitty oem that said bloat with useless apps and random freezesshutdowns are the biggest issues i have with my iphone outside of battery life i have the joy of carrying multiple devices for work
technology,removed,whoosh

technology,removed,three things you never told me why you said im scum for being alive and then deleted your comment seems like someone who loves animals as much as a furry might more strongly consider the ethics of animal breeding although im sure you very strongly consider animal breeding already seems like someone with an animal fetish would try to avoid calling others freak
technology,removed,donglesoutforharambe
technology,removed,the reason why this adapter exists is because lightning is simply not capable of streaming a raw hdmi signal across the cable lightning is a serial bus there is no clever wire multiplexing involved contrary to the opinions presented in this thread we didnt do this to screw the customer we did this to specifically shift the complexity of the adapter bit into the adapter itself leaving the host hardware free of any concerns in regards to what was hanging off the other end of the lightning cable if you wanted to produce a lightning adapter that offered something like a gpib port dont laugh i know some guys doing exactly this on the other end then the only support you need to implement on the idevice is in software not hardware the gpib adapter contains all the relevant lightning gpib circuitry

technology,removed,it seems like theyll embrace you regardless of sexual orientation religion national origin skin color or you how identify as long as you dont like donald trump an admitted sexual predator who has gone bankrupt six time cheated employees and contractors out of billions of dollars and started a fake university to bilk students and the government out of money all while acting like a dickhead and making a mockery of our democracy

technology,removed,i dont think people realize how manipulated twitter is people think that social media will make it much harder for governments to control the people through propaganda but i think the exact opposite is true social media outlets give us the perfect illusion of diversity of thought and it lets us selectively choose our own news sources we end up creating our own echochamber this applies to the left and the right

technology,removed,yawn
technology,removed,too true
technology,removed,at this point i think we can all agree that whatever articles that show trump in a good light must be propaganda coming straight from his team if elon really is on his team then im going to sell all my stocks in tesla asap like who are they trying to fool we all know that trump is evil racist xenophobic mysogynistic this fake news stuff is really gettin pathetic

technology,removed,yeah i log out of reddit a lot just for this reason its really interesting what you find when reddit isnt trying to constantly confirm your biases
technology,removed,its up to them to figure out a viable revenue model the only thing we have power over is which links get to the top of reddit so i agree we should have some level of discussion about what sources are clearly clickbait spam factories and ban their asses if its impossible to profit from writing news that means nobody wants news and the industry should just die do we really need news when every human being on the planet can post detailed evidence of events if googles installing a new underground wire then google probably has some information about it on one of their investor relations pages why the fuck do fake journalists need to write a fluffy story about it that at best gets a few tidbits of information correct and at worst is recklessly lying for their own benefit ban them all
technology,removed,its funny that you think the current system of things like corrupt cnn are somehow better than letting information flow completely freely without these corporate filters we let corrupt journalism continue and we will continue to have our oligarchyplutocracytechnocracy i wont respond any further becuase i can see which side reddit is on here and itll just give you folks more comments to downvote ive made my point and ill rest my case

technology,removed,yeah in exactly the way youve used your internet access to better your life rightfast food worker ahahahahahaahahaha blocked
technology,removed,ill take that over trumps position
technology,removed,i dont think thats the case its a rather defective way of looking at stuff for a democratic system is designed to never be effective so getting something from the state like lets say a computer would be next to impossible because the state cant manufacture that and its well meaning ideas about computers would ruin the product at best politcians can hand out favors to big players and paying pensioners more money the unemployed tend to get poorer since the untermensch shouldnt eat to freely lest it breeds people getting free stuff worked like once in the case of greece with the euro money and a second time with the american public and the no taxation policies both nations are failing right now i say that in the case of war or extreme sanctions any nation should have a base level of everything it needs the internet being an infomation exchange sytem is a part of that imagine europe finally has enough of the meddeling of america and feeding the refugees its policies generate they therefore impose sanctions on america and america has the biggest touble without public resources the masses turn into uncontrollable dogs who have to be put down which no one wants
technology,removed,gut feeling is not a legal term
technology,removed,yes ive used the hosts file found here httpsomeonewhocaresorghosts there are many others as well see the ublock lists but this is the one im most aware of not only does it block inbrowser ads it also blocks ad content and trackers in anything where software connects to the internet that is software like skype wont have those embedded ads its also a good failsafe in case for some reason the extensions you use get uninstalled or you switch users and the such you could also see if your routermodem permits you to add hosts blacklisting entries that way you can get a basic level of protection throughout the network you use this could be useful if some relative is insistent on not using basic system safety and tries to installs malware from a known malware domain as an example ill see about ublock matrix i could really use the ability to finetune what i block

technology,removed,what the fuck are you talking about
technology,removed,its a movement of free speech love of ones country right leaning policies and of hate against pc culture i got fed up with being called a racist because i think we should deport people who are here illegally my reasons for wanting them deported have nothing to do with race they are a burden to the economy they do not pay taxes and i dont care if they are taking jobs others would not do those businesses would be forced to pay higher wages to their employees if they were citizens yes the cost gets passed on to the customer but their is more money in the market then often illegals send their money out of the country to their families out of the usa it is all about money our debt doubled in years and i am not racist for seeing the fact that we cant keep this up when people started calling me a racist for this i became alt right they created this problem by trying to force us to do what they want through shame it will not work
technology,removed,the internet is a big enough place that they can create a little corner somewhere that doesnt contaminate mainstream sites with lies and hate
technology,removed,they can saw whatever they want no one has to let them use their platform though they can create their own
technology,removed,blocking users and comments on a public forum is not the same as bleeping out words in your private phone calls
technology,removed,people can think and say whatever they want they dont have the right to force a private company to host their comments
technology,removed,nothing is preventing those groups or any other groups from making their own websites or using their own resources to communicate online no private company and no other individuals has to host them

technology,removed,i am honestly starting to not care if trump cracks down on traditional media as much as people are afraid he might its basically useless propaganda already so who really gives a fuck if its ruined a tiny bit more
technology,removed,i hear you and for the most part id agree but at the same time i am so sick of the total shit job the media is doing overall that i do nonetheless find myself caring less and less about them i feel like of everything i read is either blatant disinformation partially wrong or paid content masquerading as opinion i have personally watched multiple companies pay for opinion articles that they actually wrote to be published by journalists who pretended to write the articles themselves most media is just clickbait or advertising and if of it is garbage that harms societys ability to function rationally is the other worth it doses of gaslighting alongside dose of truth i dunno

technology,removed,or who electorally just voted that they approve of this
technology,removed,yeah and i doubt they have the same concerns we have about the fcc whats with reddit lately its become a massive liberal cock sucking machine i get it we elected an asshole but of that is because the dems wanted to elect someone who would have sold her loyalty to the highest bidder i mean shit guys have a little objectivity here the dems do the same shit the republicans do yeah republicans have fucked up the system but so have the dems not to mention they seem to own next to all news media now like fuck every day its pictures of obama and the first lady with captions calling them greatest presidents ever shits getting old someone points out the dems do the same thing and all the sudden its oh they had an excuse oh the it was a different time fuck sake you guys are annoying as fuck around election season full blown fucking hive mind mode every fucking years
technology,removed,how does deleting my posts after a short time exclude me from being able to ask for proof of an unsubstantiated claim is it because you just want to scroll all my posts and make a character judgment based on them
technology,removed,i dont doubt it the problem is the selective enforcement though if you hate the right people you wont be touched
technology,removed,lol deflection deflection deflection hey ferguson is just one cityits not exemplary of our entire judicial system except that even the report itself says that it is hey redlining and white flight happened during the and like what or generations ago um no thats my generationnot to mention thst gentrification is literally the exact same thing happening todaywith a new fancy name and new faces but the exact same way of moving people of color out of their own neighborhoods and extracting wealth from us jesus dude you couldnt even take my evidence seriously thats how cognitively dissonant you are thats how powerful white supremacy is you refuse to even see it when its directly in front of your face at the end of the day black people make up of the population own less than of the wealth and make up almost of the prison populationand you dont think it has anything to do with racism jesus youre fucking clueless
technology,removed,the assertion was made that blm heads have been banned for a specific violation the the tos i requested some proof of that claim then you link an article about a blm head being banned for a different tos violation i explain that the article is dealing with a different type of violation and admittedly condecendingly ask if you read the article because it has no bearing on the topic at hand no one said anything about ban bots except you

technology,removed,its considerably more difficult
technology,removed,
technology,removed,hm thats true
technology,removed,if we only allow mainstream speech we will lose access to important ideas im not suggesting that we suppress nonmainstream speech and that isnt what is happening right now im saying that mainstream media are unlikely to tolerate nonmainstream ideas or presentation because it offends their viewership and advertisers and costs them money i dont think twitter is making a moral decision here theyre making a business decision open access to ideas outside of the mainstream is why public media npr pbs cspan is valuable fight isis and the altright when they say horrible things by pointing out how horrible they are point it out to whom exactly do you think youre going to convince a jihadist to accept gays or get an altright guy to consider how fucking retarded their concept of white genocide is theyre born in an echo chamber and even in public they retain access to that echo chamber twitter itself is also an echo chamber with an easily curated list of connections understand that any publicity you offer to these groups serves only to give them recruitment opportunities you arent going to convert the brainwashed
technology,removed,just as in justice
technology,removed,and of the people who do know most of them dont realize how it will affect them
technology,removed,there is no hope
technology,removed,i strongly recommend that the best thing you can do is pony up cash to these organizations legal fights make for publicity and publicity leads to news stories and news stories lead to blogs and rants which can cause surveillance fetishists to actually pay a price for taking these stands and perhaps if youre lucky legal fights by themselves might bear fruit in terms of having things struck down two things impact political systems and two things only and ive been watching a lot of people forget about this lately threats to bank accounts threats to power sometimes these are one in the same and i would also suggest that as the internet is transnational and the policies of one country may impact anothers indirectly this is a good time to build an international coalition against the surveillance state and view it as one thing five eyes is one thing
technology,removed,exactly
technology,removed,as far as surveillance is concerned a clinton presidency wouldnt be any better maybe even worse since libtards would pretend like she could do no wrong as she expanded the surveillance state like they did w obama at least with a trump presidency libtards will oppose any expansions he puts forthmaybe not for the right reasons mind you but they will oppose them
technology,removed,whats the bet if you use encryption your instantly guilty of well something and are made a target suspect not someone enforcing their right to privacy
technology,removed,huh im saying what if the government wants to target a section of the population using information people think the government doesnt care about the problem with expansive powers of the government is not when a good guy is in power its when a bad guy is in power what is hemophobic and listloving mike pence wants to start a faggot registry and he knows who all the gay people are because of nsa snooping surely youre not so obtuse or coddled to think a government could transgress against its population why help them

technology,removed,my family to this day still tells the story of my uncle screaming at the comcast guy on the phone during christmas dinner stick it up your asshole sideways you stupid cocksucker hes a good time
technology,removed,god dammit
technology,removed,this is why i record my calls the fucks at time warner tried some bullshit and i was like one sec yeah hear that thats a recording of the call check your state laws to make sure you can legally or what the requirements are those fucks honored everything because of the recording
technology,removed,how is it more secure sure heres how it works in the past merchants transmitted your full payment details from the pos thru the visamastercard networks this info if not properly secured can be intercepted prior to the transmission at the pos by a third party and stolen with the chip cards a onetime use transaction token is generated using the chip and is sent to authorize payment if this token is intercepted its not an issue since it is useless for running future transactions none of this stuff would have happened if dumbass retailers like target hadnt let hvac companies have access to their internal network including the pos none of this would have happened if home depot had hired a halfwaycompetant vendor none of this would have happened if tjmaxx and michaels hadnt had some of the worst security imaginable and gotten hacked over and over and over again the merchants are to blame for this idiocy and customer pain it is ridiculous to watch merchants resist this change and subvert the liability shift when their awful security practices caused the events forcing this transition
technology,removed,thank you
technology,removed,comcast has billion in assets this fine is less than a weeks profit
technology,removed,i havent even bothered to install flash in the browser i use the most its not really needed most of the time
technology,removed,flash pronounces steve jobs dead first
technology,removed,fastcom can be whitelisted while netflix isnt because they are on two different domains it doesnt matter who the owner is
technology,removed,the other key factor for the commercialisation of this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhackmpzurmo is mass production and scalability
technology,removed,it has been removed because you are stupid you mean of course you know better than tedcom about titles i dont give a damn about why you remove and how you like your cucumbers play with your marbles and give us a break
technology,removed,chill out and frame those rules over your bed for all we care and have fun removing valuable content beyond the grasp of twisted rules framework
technology,removed,if i tried to sign into facebook and it said please disable your adblocker to continue using facebook id say goodbye facebook it was a horrible relationship and im glad you finally did the thing that makes me leave for good
technology,removed,as long as malware can be or is distributed through online ads ads will remain blocked on my entire home network and all devices as long as ads take up the majority of screen real estate on an appreciable number of sites it will remain blocked as long as ads are served to mobile devices and create a problem with consuming content it will remain blocked as long as web site owners complain about ads being blocked and prevent me from seeing content it will remain blocked to sum it up stop allowing malware through your ad stream stop trying to force me to see your ads stop being douchenozzles with your ads stop being douchenozzles about my free choice and how i control my computer and bandwidth usage
technology,removed,theres actually a way that i can think of immediately to get around ad blockers a content delivery network that the browser never sees its served up to the web server the web server encodes the ad image and injects it into ad container tags about the only thing you can do at that point is recognize patterns in the containing html tags or pattern recognition in the images themselves
technology,removed,
technology,removed,the just show you all the content what
technology,removed,i dont understand what you are trying to say facebook didnt change at all for me i see not ads
technology,removed,well yeah i mean you kind of got my point about the pattern recognition
technology,removed,adblock has an element hiding feature all of their adposts have the same patterns to them which allow you to block them from the screen furthermore facebook purity has options to hide them as well between that and ublock and alternate dns which blocks ad domains you should be golden
technology,removed,and im saying that is literally all the article is about it is in the title
technology,removed,you uh you know you can turn off autoplay right
technology,removed,need need for javascript for a encoded image the browser renders it natively throw in some serverside random containertag generation and use dynamically generated guids for claasses ad ids injected with css dynamically generated to match and the mouse got a whole lot harder to catch
technology,removed,i didnt say it was a good solution same thing with serving the ads through the web server as encoded images the site would then be eating the bandwidth for the ads
technology,removed,i just iterate through the dom and look for a container that renders base encoded data as an image and if images are all encoded thats the first thing i would do encode all of the images also use random guids when i need to use ids dynamically generate class names and generate a stylesheet on the fly to deal with those dynamic class names and the icing on the cake would be a random number of container tags that are inconsequential to layout and functionality so that you cant say post entry ad container with encoded image or even by class name since you could then just inject displaynone you dont know the dom you cant figure out xpath you dont know the id or the class about maybe the only thing you could do is look for whether or not theres a reply box and even then it could be faked injected in there but cascade style rules hide it from the user with perhaps a special subset of guids that are always rejected by the server for replies maybe im just dreaming or talking out mah butt
technology,removed,the domain needs to start taking responsibility for the ads they show just like any other media provider as for tracking there are other ways that dont depend on beacons javascript or ip address
technology,removed,i work in digital advertising as an engineer advertising pays for free content whether or not you think that it should every time you connect your facebook account to some website facebook drops a cookie and tracks your behavior off and on fb the fb audience network is going to be their biggest revenuegenerating stream shortly if you dont want to be tracked do not connect your fb accountor google accountsign up with your regular email address and clear you cookies regularly ads suck no denying that and many of us in the industry realize this however all of the tracking measuring and analyzing of ad performance is an attempt to deliver better ads that are tailored towards the user at least with the internet unlike tv print or radio advertisers are trying to make it a better experience there are always going to be shitty scammy people out there but most are just honest businesses trying to sell products or services
technology,removed,wait until you pass puberty your views will change
technology,removed,its too early for this
technology,removed,facebook has always been something ive barely tolerated because of how it easily categorizes my contactsbut fuck this shit
technology,removed,lol what the fuck does that matter there are billion monthly users for facebook skype has million monthly users there is nothing factual about skype is the videoaudio chat client that your friends and family are most likely to have its just a flat out stupid fucking statement doing nothing but trying to hate on facebook
technology,removed,you know what scares me about the whole thing ive thought up here dns blockers wont even catch it if youre on a bandwidth limit it still sucks it down no on your point though youre right and theres only so much you can do to defeat that kind of analysis but my um solution means that you can only block it at the browser level routers and dns services cant stop it
technology,removed,well yeah and site providers need to be held responsible for the content it servers up just like every of content provider currently is whether its tv radio magazine etc
technology,removed,that is an unofficial pirated copy of fb purity i wouldnt trust it you can get the real deal at the fb purity website httpinstallfbpuritycom
technology,removed,no im talking more about when you used things like httpsenwikipediaorgwikigopherprotocol and httpsenwikipediaorgwikilynxwebbrowser to navigate the internet so no nothing flashed or was animated or popped up as those annoying things didnt exist at all there also werent really any images at all and yeah it was pretty great is it better now yeah as long as you run adblock its better now
technology,removed,anyone who has a problem with end users blocking ads they dont want to see is an enemy of the people and ought to be flogged in public vigorously and repeatedly
technology,removed,trust me all the analytics you need can be found serverside even though all the analytics you actually want are clientside
technology,removed,heres this from the social fixer extension you may have seen the news facebook is going to prevent apps like adblock from blocking ads on their site but what about social fixer the new version of social fixer almost done gives users the power to block anything they dont want to see including all advertising and sponsored posts and since it actually embeds itself into facebook and has access to the internal code in theory it can block many things that traditional ad blockers cannot this is just one example of the power and flexibility of the new social fixer it lets users customize personalize and enhance their facebook experience in all new ways and if you choose to hide all advertising thats your choice ps i think i am within a few days of being done with development soon
technology,removed,i would rather shovel manure than fuck with the perception of reality they also outsource some labor to foreign firms you may feel more willing to fuck with perceptions of wealthy norway folks than your own countrymen httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubot
technology,removed,good hopefully it works and reddit can rot with the sexist and misogynists that its infested with the way they claim they cant hold people accountable because of free speech is the reason why the website is one of the worst

technology,removed,years and with the free version you can disable ads permanently with mod permissions and you still couldnt be bothered to spend a few bucks on the pro version to thank the developer for his work i use a different reddit app but why people go above and beyond to avoid giving devs money through ads or a purchase is beyond me

technology,removed,the reason that the giant tortoise wasnt properly classified by scientists for so long appears to be quite simple they were so delicious that no specimens ever made it back to europe without being eaten on the voyage according to scores of accounts over several centuries the giant tortoise is by far the most edible creature man has ever encountered explorers compared them to chicken beef mutton and butter – but only to say how much better the tortoise was one tortoise would feed several men and both its meat and its fat were perfectly digestible no matter how much you ate

technology,removed,im not disagreeing with you but i just want to point out that the very fact that youre letting them take your photo allows them to basically do whatever they want with it later as long as the law allows it so if i have millions of photos of peoples faces associated with their identities its not as if i need to start a new collection program to make those photos useful to facial recognition software it would be trivial to tie all of the data they already have into facial recognition systems in places like airports and train stations

technology,removed,good advice unfortunately it doesnt apply to me because im not at fairchild afb but rather in canada where we have different carriers than you i was speaking from experience with looking into this with my carrier my options are to either buy the new phone outright paying like or something or getting a new contract which would give me less data at a higher cost

technology,removed,project optical social network hello my name is lovet arnold i am years old i am studying in the last year at the faculty of medicine belcampus of drc kinshasa i am african and cameroonian i am a genius in all modesty and i write because what loneliness has eaten me for a while already it is not easy to live in africa and why carrying out projects of this size is impossible my dream is to open a research lab i do not pretend to anything but i have decided to sacrifice my time to make me also listen in this vast world so please be attentive im going to talk about one of the thousand ideas that cross my mind every day because you probably do not know but when you of qi one does not often make many friends these are rather complex concepts good without delay i will give you a topo of what this project is social optical network it is the fastest current information system ever designed a lens placed on the eye connected wirelessly to a processor will be placed at the level of the temporal it will serve as a router and emergency call system an app will be available to simply access the account data of each user we imagine then to walk with a contact lens on one eye because god gave us two the one connected via your telephone to several other lenses of other users around the world with a single click social networks share images videos and others but here we speak of a direct connection of a sense and of the fastest view be able to see at any moment what happens to you via your home appliances or prepare at home and be at the same time videoconference or be driving and watch the news live and no comments the possibilities are infinite since the spectrum of color of the eye will be able to adapt to several windows open at the same time in the interface whose manipulation by gestures would be the icing on the cake how to make this jewel a total of teams are required in domains electronics computing medicine network and communications quantum physics nanotechnology i have this gift of being able to synthesize the different applications of several domains like these and to draw evidences that jump to the nose every day so i will try to explain how to crack such a device but do not forget that it is only at the foot of the wall that one recognizes the true macon lets start with the parts of the device they have parts the lens the transponder and the telephone mobile app the lens different all other contact lenses it has two glazed parts covered on itself and containing in its middle all its components the internal part acts as a screen thanks to its projector which transmits its light directly to the optical receivers of the spectrum of colors as with a conventional projector its external part has a camera which connects the successive images to the transponder located on the temples in the vicinity obvious reason i would like to spend more time talking about its waterresist system or again of the various layers of insulation required or of its very particular adhesiveness of the other lenses guaranteeing that they will not fall regardless of the force due to the lancunar pressure of its internal face lockable and unlocking from your smartphone an eye omnipresent allowing you to communicate follow your activities watch your children even far in your eye next gensmart should suffice for all seen from the fiber to the box via the improved videophone the transponder as the name suggests it serves as the basis for transferring videoconferencing to your phone the idea of ​​keeping away from the eye any form of heat emission it will diffuse the food load for use and regulate the use of the device it will also take care of the standby mode and will have its own autonomy so as not to overload the complexes the transponder is broad of ovoid shape resembling a leech it is he who will be in charge of managing the communications the calls and the receptions of images a good quality of images will rely solely on the capacity of the processors of the latter note that if you lose your phone the favorite numbers of your contact will be at your disposal as well as all emergency calls it is the nerve center that allows the reorganization and processing of images that arrive from the smartphone and come out of the lens its role is much broader if i have to talk about hd format or visual navigation interface if it is incorporated with vocal or gestural commands i can not bother you anymore you are so far from me i keep courage not to write in vain the mobile appli well we are already at the front end so im lying these last years at sight quite a lot of movement of the side apps mainly games and utilities hypermarket to name but those there i think what would please the users of such a concept would be an open and very evolving application that adapts to the situation and the country for culture for example a practical interface like that of whatsapp or viber for chat but with a touch of pokemon go for the rest like video internet digital tv and social networks twitter can very easily serve as a link to retrieve close friends as distant and the most important element is the social networking aspect that being able to see and follow in streaming what happens everywhere see a game sitting at home you since the eye of the abiter in the stadium or the commentator or images even more exclusive shocks imagine yourself as the extent of the realities that all these eyes can see incredible here i hit these few lines because nothing is lost im not a defeatist but since the very depths of africa alone i can not make it i have so many solutiuons unimaginable as my most recent is the gravitational push which has dreamed men for a long time yes i have the solution that if i told you it would be only wind very simple it is the same principle that keeps all the celestial bodies in weightlessness the body the senses of rotations the sense of forcetract and repulsive forces all in a particular equilbre i do not try to investigate but if you like technology like we love it then do not let this message fall as in the ears of the ignorant if i can not realize my dreams i entrust this task to you reader go to the end for all i have not given up yet here is a number that i leave to all those who are interested by me and my project head do not make me wait too long i have been waiting for years it will be fun can be but do not judge me because this is not my story just an sos understand me and call me i am ready to change the face of the world

technology,removed,usa half of the people i have talked to have been super nice but just repeated the same scripted lines over and over the other half have been smug assholes from the start of the conversation from geniuses all the way to executive relations they have all said if they were in my shoes theyd be upset as welland then they go on to refuse to make it right people who have good experiences can never seem to accept that others may have had very bad ones and need to believe its a lie or they are doing it wrong it doesnt matter how easy you find themthat doesnt take these experiences away
technology,removed,at this point bringing it back to life is too little too late i want a refund or replacement and honestly id much prefer a refund because i have no more faith in apple after my shit experiences with multiple products i asked for help with this for yearsits never worked right if they did replace it id sell it immediately and use the money for something else its just infuriating to see real victims of their bullshit constantly minimized or even blamed people need to imagine if it were them in that situation

technology,removed,i dont have the time or the crayons to explain how nonsensical your original post was but its going to bother me if i dont are you an engineer do you know what caused the issue then im going to bet the answer is no to both of those questions you go on to refute their explanation and claim apple fucked it up and theyre saving face the article is describing the defect the fuck up that happened so you either didnt read the article or it doesnt matter what apple says because its fake news andor just want to bash them which is it
technology,removed,who gives a shit thats not the fucking point your original post creates a scenario where no matter what apple says about the issue because its fake news and theyre saving face theyre wrong you have zero expertise on what the defect was either yet you claim theyre bullshitting us dont you understand why that makes you sound like a blithering idiot
technology,removed,you are so fucking stupid
technology,removed,only a fucking moron thinks the government spying on people ever leads to good things in the long run youre obviously a teen or twenty something with zero knowledge of the real world
technology,removed,yes it is the point you claim that i am not an engineer and that i am ignorant you do not actually know if either of those things are true you clearly are no smarter then me yet you wail that my statements are wrong that is called hypocrisy are you an engineer do you know anything about what they are describing you never answered this so im going to assume you dont i dont know any more about the issue than you do but your comment came from a place of complete fud otherwise in case you missed the point and you clearly did i am calling apple out on their clear bullshit apple is trying to make it sound a lot less serious than it is given that apple is a corporation apple is clearly trying to see to it that customers do no flee to the competition i merely have a colourful way of expressing this facet of the discussion i know that was your point im saying it was bullshit again on what basis are you making this assumption why is it clear bullshit why is it more serious than theyre making it sound what is the more serious issue where are you getting all of this from it doesnt take a rocket scientist to understand that controlled ambient air is just simple air since when does a battery have a defect caused by air if you actually mustered the ability to read the article it says a battery component not the battery was exposed to the air again do you know anything about apples designs maybe the issue stemmed from components that are supposed to be air tight but werent because of the defect no i dont i do in fact understand the situation and you are upset because you do not then please answer my questions above im genuinely curious but im guessing youre just a moron
technology,removed,my point stands if current trends show anything its that many people dont want to hear actual news they want to hear things that reaffirm their preconceived notions demonize their opponents see all hillary supporters are globalist shills who want to destroy the nation state institute a world government all trump supporters are ignorant racists who want to bring fascism

technology,removed,they sell them on the sidewalk out of suitcases and garbage bags in front of the apple stores in hong kong and nothing happens
technology,removed,i guess doubling down when repeatedly proven wrong is yours ill take being a condescending douche bag and right
technology,removed,but im not wrong am i notice how you didnt say anything to the effect that i was wrong for someone who so desperately wants to be right you dont seem to be able to refute that
technology,removed,i think at this point go fuck yourself is appropriate
technology,removed,i cant believe netflix hasnt grown their catalog theyre pumping their money into content creation rather than content acquisition
technology,removed,i feel like product design in general has lost the plot function has given too much way to fashion and i hate that so many consumers are ok with it its trickled down frm luxury goods to even the most basic items i dont understand what designers and people consider premium i dont think glass metal thin and heavy are better for a phone i want a lightweight device with durable plastics or composites things that take a lot of abuse and can be replaced when they are irreparably damaged
technology,removed,they pay more for content now idiot
technology,removed,partially yesbut blaming the consumer ignores the other half of the story for example i am told everyone wants phablets because thats what they buy the problem is thats all there really is and people need phonesso those who settle are counted as wanting this and blamed for it as well i dont find most products i buy to be what i wantbut i need that thing so have to get the least worst option most of the time
technology,removed,what i was getting at is i dont believe there arent enough people i think people buying whats available when they need a phone creates the false idea that what sells is what we want if small and large were both available and large massively outsold small phones then that would prove something
technology,removed,no problem i would suggest googling around but to help you get started many are in line with my suggestion something like asus or acer computers do well and i stick by my solution as going with tradional laptop saves you debugging issues in the long run and you dont have to teach her how to use a tablet unless she knows how to use tablets
technology,removed,and if everyone were a worthless cunt like you theyd stop putting out movies
technology,removed,had to disable my stupid ok google bullshit because that google advertisement would always come on tv with ok google what sound does a whale make and my dumbass phone would say im sorry i didnt understand that
technology,removed,the facebook app already does exactly that its constantly listening and collecting everything anyone around your phone says
technology,removed,there was a post about it happening to people with the app having conversations and then getting targeted ads based on them its b happening to my friends too maybe its not the facebook app though
technology,removed,no theyre getting targeted ads right after they have a conversation saying some of the keywords without having actually searched for anything like that it may be a different app or something else though
technology,removed,try another good reason i dont use facebook
technology,removed,yes
technology,removed,the reason fb is subject to german law is because they have an office in hamburg and partner with various german companies for things like advertising all fb needs to do is stop working with german advertisement companies and remove their hamburg office then they dont need to ever deal with germany again at that point the best germany can hope to do is force their isps to block germans access to the fb domain as is stands germany can create these laws and fb is subject to them reddit for example wouldnt be subject to this law because reddit inc has no business association with any german companies or offices in germany reddit inc does part of doing business in other countries means dealing with different laws right now facebook is creating a censorship tool in hopes that china will let them operate there i imagine theyll soon build something to appease germany as well the money theyd leave on the table is too much too ignore best best for free speech sites are to create a company in the us builduse us data centers and do not affiliate yourself with any companies in different countries

technology,removed,whatever happened to critical thinking reading something then drawing your own conclusions are we so lazy and stupid now that we cant do a search after reading an article to see if its fakedumb youd think with google and with almost everyone with a god damn super computer in your pocket that can find any information at any time and any place youd think wed be a bit smarter

technology,removed,i had a diversity presentation last friday and learned you can be written up for using the word gay for example he told us about how he was forced to warn one of his staff for saying my workload is gay is that not pushing it im not saying that i dont use crazy or that it carries a hostile connotation but along the same lines as using gay people with mental afflictionsimbalances could be offended that the descriptor being used as an insult is something that suggests having their qualities also societys perception of what isis not acceptable changes as time goes on theres no standard for what is okay and what is pushing it so i wouldnt fault them for stating what they think is okay in their environment

technology,removed,we arent just enjoying the shitstorm they have managed to bring upon themselves notice no one is even remotely talking about any of the positive features of the phone because of this

technology,removed,figure out the value at sedocom tell him its x or for a lower bid youll put it on sedo for auction you can also sell it to his competitor if you have a website on the domain then you should be fine lawyer letters are sometimes used to just scare someone into doing what the client wants there are plenty of extensions out there besides com hes just trying to push you if you sell directly make sure you get a certified checkmoney order dont transfer the domain until the money clears
technology,removed,domain names are evaluated on a few different metrics including age registered vs length keywords existing traffic and such also check out namejetcom
technology,removed,im worried how abuse in these tech fields is going to ruin my employment you should be worried this isnt sour grapes its a righteous fury brewing among whitecollar tech workers in the us were sick of being told that thirdworld code coolies are just as good as we are if not better by smarmy salesmen who dont have a clue how to tell good from bad all foreign workers are being viewed through the lens of the incompetence that we native professionals have to tolerate each day of course there are great foreignborn workers and students like you who grind their way to professional competence the right way unfortunately youre going to be lumped in with the sweatshop morons who are imported specifically to put people like me out of work good luck and godspeed

technology,removed,no usa wages are to high of the world population make much less of what usa workers make
technology,removed,this needs to happen faster in order to boost productivity and end this crisis
technology,removed,so if productivity is low why their production numbers go up
technology,removed,problem is price basic goodsand housing are rising higher than our wages maybe you should not exchange goods and services in a currency that can be easily inflated by the banking system after the median income was usd per year and the oz of gold was you can make numbers to see why is that a problem for you
technology,removed,you have a idea to solve it be more productive or more competitive
technology,removed,i noticed that when using tor i can be logged into reddit in one tab open another reddit instance in a new tab that has an exit ip in a different country yet i am still logged in this is with ublock origin and privacy badger turned on as well along with the recommended privacy settings in the tbb so what is it that is leaking my identity to reddit in that case

technology,removed,the way that they sourced the information was by using the app google opinion rewards i earned over last year by just answering about one second survey ever couple of days how does google maps know it sources the answers from its local guides — google maps users who answer questions about the places they visit on everything from cost to quietness i cant imagine that this took that much time they could have also done it by simply sending an email to all of those businesses asking them the question with yesnonot open to public options

technology,removed,mitm attack is usless the way key exchange works is that i give you my public key and you give me your public key neither of us are aware of eachothers private keys only you know your private key and only i know my private key you encrypt any messages to me using my public key and i encrypt any messages to you using your public key the only thing that can decrypt messages encrypted by my public key is my private key which no one has except me same goes for you think of it like you giving me a pad lock i write my message to you and put it in a box and then lock it with the pad lock you gave me the only person that can unlock the box once its locked is you because only you have the key the private key is never exchanged between the parties communicating thus mitm is entirely useless for the purpose of eavesdropping on a private conversation encrypted with symmetric encryption like tls the connection is private or secure because symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt the data transmitted the keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a shared secret negotiated at the start of the session see tls handshake protocol the server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted see algorithm below the negotiation of a shared secret is both secure the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be obtained even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection and reliable no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected the identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using publickey cryptography this authentication can be made optional but is generally required for at least one of the parties typically the server the connection ensures integrity because each message transmitted includes a message integrity check using a message authentication code to prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during in addition to the properties above careful configuration of tls can provide additional privacyrelated properties such as forward secrecy ensuring that any future disclosure of encryption keys cannot be used to decrypt any tls communications recorded in the past sourcehttpsenwikipediaorgwikitransportlayersecurity

technology,removed,semitic refers to the language group but yes israelisjews in general share the same genetic markers as people from the middle east however this feels to me like a semantic way to make antisemitic not matter israelis and palestinians are very clearly not the same people and again i mainly see this crop up to defeat the term antisemitic without acknowledging that jewish people didnt even choose the terminology designated to indicate discrimination against them
technology,removed,fuck israel and jews
technology,removed,they arent bombed you fucking idiot if anything theyre the ones doing the bombing and they arent relegated to that strip of land they can move and travel freely many work in israel because palestine has such a shit economy

technology,removed,i assume you have google whitelisted
technology,removed,people downvote you but the odds of getting malware through ads is a million times smaller then landing on a random site but of course i bet these people only visits sites they know
technology,removed,you do realize most content websites and of the things you see on reddit wouldnt exist without those corporations right hint nobody hosts your content for free you want to watch a videopictureread an articlelisten to music only happens if somebody pays for it you are leeching but that only works if somebody else pays for it not everybody can be a cheapstake like you imagine its like a houseparty everybody shows up and brings a bunch of drinks now you show up dont bring anything and drink everybodys beer you could do that but if everybody does it there is no beer and no party so please dont act like you have a solution of just going back when its a blatant lie
technology,removed,well the vast majority of those that do youtube for a living

technology,removed,oh fuck you both with a rusty chainsaw

technology,removed,the fact that there is no service like this shows you are wrong
technology,removed,actually it was several billion and some even died
technology,removed,httpsacceptableadscom what is not considered an acceptable ad the following types of ads are currently unacceptable and cannot be considered for inclusion on the whitelist ads that visibly load new ads if the primary content does not change ads with excessive or non userinitiated hover effects animated ads autoplaysound or video ads expanding ads generally oversized image ads interstitial page ads overlay ads overlay invideo ads popups popunders preroll video ads rich media ads eg flash ads shockwave ads etc i have no issue with this if the ad industry selfregulated to stop these dangerous and intrusive methods none of this would be necessary i understand that websites need revenue and this seems like a proconsumer way to deliver
technology,removed,ublock orign gibs me dat karma

technology,removed,i have always hated the mobile phone market every phone has some dealbreaker some feature removed or some bullshit flaw same with laptops really it cant be that hard to just make a simple tier system that covers all cases make a compact and phablet size make a flagship midrange and budget version of each give all devices the standard features people never ask to be removed like sd slot differentiate with processors camera etc done all use cases covered in six models
technology,removed,how would adding the latest processors and cameras to the flagship and passing the rest down lead to no innovation removing ports is not innovation making thinner devices is not innovation it really is this easy i have never met anyone who said please remove the sd slot or i want my phone even thinner but dont care about battery life markets drive purchases despite peoples beliefs that its the other way around i like small devices but i cant get one so if i want a funcitonal phone i have to buy bigand then people say they make what we want and thats why they are huge phones nothats all there is so i buy one and they count that as proof thats what we want
technology,removed,publishers will get to keep percent of all ad revenue from marketplace ads with the remaining percent being divided between various other parties involved with serving the ads adblock plus will receive percent of total revenue id be kinda pissed if i was trying to run a website and some random party was skimming off my ad revenue
technology,removed,thats like saying england is white so i can talk about it in a racist context even though there are shitskins all over
technology,removed,we are
technology,removed,ghostly also sells ads so drop it asap
technology,removed,rretiredjpg
technology,removed,it doesnt
technology,removed,it is a bastard stepchild of adblock animal farm and alice in wonderland see adblock plus started out with a promise it would block every ad it could then it begain to blocks every ad unless the ad was acceptable ie that it cleared a lengthy review by adblock plus not sure of the criteria now publishers can display a preapproved series of ads to adblock plus users and adblock plus takes a cut of the revenue as does google and appnexus so youre seeing ads and most of the money does not even go to the content provider something it would take a collaboration btw george orwell and lewis carroll to create

technology,removed,nice ad
technology,removed,this is absolutely and completely preposterous your entire argument is on the basis of there only being two options ads or pay to view this is better known as a false dilemma fallacy making up a set of options and claiming that those are the only ones when there are and could be many more all ad blockers do is push content providers to come up with new ways to make money
technology,removed,so year old shill who thinks they are a legitimate poster
technology,removed,time to unleash gen
technology,removed,im not a us citizen and have never really followed us lawpolitics so full disclosure i might be completely wrong about this but my understanding is if you were still residing in america then it doesnt matter very much where the attack was executed from youre still within us jurisdiction assuming china doesnt leap to your defence and argue that you are actually a chinese citizen and should be tried under their system etc if you were residing in china youd probably be much safer the patriot act doesnt seem to confer any any additional rendition aka extradition rights for things like this so the us could certainly request to have you deported but china isnt obliged to cooperate and the us doesnt have any kind of treaty with china that would encourage them to try so all in all youd probably end up on a watchlist but if you stayed in china or are just really careful about where you travel then i think you could get away with it

technology,removed,assuming im a shill too awesome i guess thats kinda your thing paranoia must be crippling sometimes a cigar is just a cigar they force you youll need to back that up before you are seen as credible product also youll need to correct that too have a weak argument inflate the price of the product in question in the direction you want it to go to the nearest and you should take your own advice and realize people dont want the same thing as you i actually did admit that in the post youre replying to blind rage is getting in the way of your reading comprehension it alienates half of your customer base stats for half the customer base being alienated because you are full of shit for every person like you theres a person like me again with that thing you think is true but havent backed up dont you know tim cook just got a salary cut for poor performance dont you know his salary remained the same but it was his performance bonus that he did not get im sure you did know this as im sure you know the airpods are and not they couldve kept the jack and still had the airpods that is a fair point but we are talking about two different things here maybe they want to get rid of the headphone jack anyway i think they do and the airpods are their answer to that keep in mind there are also thousands of other answers if you dont want to use apples product you have a strange definition of forced also you havent given any concrete reason as to why you like the airpods this comes off as even more shilley im not here to give a review to you i just like them im sure when i tell you why i like them paranoids like you will just say well thats just what shill would say hilarious but also very sad and im not the only one millions of people agree with me too thats not a good product when millions of users are being disenfranchised just for a stupid money grab our presidentelect has taught us many negotiation tactics assume a figure is correct then reference that figure to get farther away from the actual truth millions of people agree with you huh back it up the airpods are awesome because i can wear one of them i get hours on a charge and hours if i wear one at a time which i very frequently do and the carrying case is also a charger with hour battery life they snap in magnetically without the horrible microusb connector and the charging case uses the unidirectional lightning connector that i already have lots of cables for i have a pair of nice studio headphones that i wear once a month or so and when i get an iphone with no jack ill have to use a dongle but that will likely just live on the cord of my studio headphones the airpods will be my listening device for of audio and im not looking for audiophile sound out of something so portable and accessible thats why i love them i get why other people are not interested in them and thats cool what scares me is that there are people like you that are genuinely paranoid and assuming im a shill because i have a different opinion than you youre unable to differentiate between these things and i fear there are lots of people like you in public its good that we are only talking about headphones and not something more serious but i guess thats what a shill would say
technology,removed,how common do you really think it is i get that it happens but people just assume someone is a shill when they have a different opinion its lazy and ignorant the best shills probably go unrecognized at least thats how they taught us to do in in shill school

technology,removed,im not so sure about that a lot of things often called loopholes were intentionally added
technology,removed,it has nothing to do with the vehicles overall safety and everything to do with a cost analysis that ford did actually run said analysis decided that per car to fix the issue wasnt worth it the fun bit is they actually calculated the cost to society of all the lives they could have saved and worked out that it would cost ford more to fix the cars than it would cost society for those people to die
technology,removed,the most recent one was that russia hacked a power plant or something the other thing was that they perpetuated was that the cia had verified the russians complicity in doing so whereas there was not one cia report confirming that you can see how they just link to themselves as proof in their article no actual statements from anyone thats verifyable straight goods fake news

technology,removed,i want anker shills to leave
technology,removed,most things from ali are trash quality though thats why they are so cheap so i dont feel its a fair comparison to cables being sold on amazon from chinese manufacturers ali is the lowest common denominator in production of electronics

technology,removed,as crazy as it sounds this is one of the reasons ive reverted to doing a lot of my shopping on ebay yeah theres junk out there but at least i can accurately sort through it
technology,removed,god forbid you are a techie who orders a lot of tech products from amazon if a lot of them end up being fake and you start the return process amazon dings your account after an undisclosed amount of returns amazon will ban you from buying from them they dont even take customers seriously their support is super nice but useless

technology,removed,i dont know what car ill be driving but im not giving up my pickup truck
technology,removed,never will they ever tell you that the legal ramifications alone will keep any ai from being allowed to say such things i agree with most of what you write but im not sure about this bit consider sites wwwnamecompatibilitycalculatorcom that freely claim to rate your compatibility with other people based solely on a name or the prevalence of psychics who claim to give accurate advice im not saying that any of the major players cortana google now siri will be in a rush to implement things like this but i have no trouble at all believing that people will build ais specifically for this purpose eg ashley maddison could increase its client base if people installed an app that slowly subtly convinced them that their relationship was going downhill without ever explicitly saying you should cheat on your wife

technology,removed,hbo has a sort of mini ad at the beginning of their shows it only plays ads for their own content so its more like previews but still i cancelled after my free trial was up because of that and because the web player didnt work well
technology,removed,yeah but hopefully nintendo doesnt go full retard with micro transactions
technology,removed,sup fan boi
technology,removed,also you have so much less life left and all ads are made for homoteens i remember when playstation ads got me hyped now they are just embarrassing with queerboy music and everything else that makes ads the worst
technology,removed,dont care
technology,removed,oooh edgy
technology,removed,the edginess is too much for me
technology,removed,ice explained quite a lot of exactly these things in this thread the thing that ive explained many times is that the problem isnt things being adversely affected at the inlet and outlet holes but the opposite there is too much life that springs up because of the low current and nutrient rich water the only real design consideration is to place the inlet far enough away from the outlet so that the brine concentration in the water is sufficiently dispersed such that even if the current is drawing the water directly from the outlet to the inlet it will have dispersed sufficiently such that it doesnt enter the inlet thats it and thats simply because you dont want to be desalinating already desalinated water everything around the inlet and outlet is teeming with life because of what they are doing
technology,removed,uh im fairly sure you just made on something that didnt belong to you if se is anything like blizzard your characters are not your property to begin with you do not have any legal right to sell them

technology,removed,just an anecdote from an apple user my mobo and gpu fried in my imac im sure the poorly ventilated aluminum casing didnt help while it was possible to repair it my options were restricted to replacing the failing hardware with hardware of the exact same specifications as the original pieces which were at that point years old and paying the same price for them as when they were newcurrent meaning no possibility of upgrading a year old imac further the cost of repair with outdated hardware would have been more than the cost of just buying a new imac not including labor as per an apple authorized repair shop as well as the apple store i wasnt keen on doing it myself which i did suss out on ifixit just due to needing to remove the screen to gain access to the interior risk of damaging the portcables to the screen and issues with fan management triggered by replacing core components the limited space also meant that i could perform only minor upgrades no upgrading to a current gpu or a better motherboard so while it is possible to repair them and even doing so on your own they make it very prohibitive to do so i enjoyed my imac and still have my macbook pro ipad and iphone could definitely have been considered a fan of the products but have since gone back to pc just for the sake of being able to keep it updated and the ease and cost efficiency of upgrading plus getting a decent base gaming rig was still less than the cost of replacing the imac further reducing waste id rather invest into a wellbuilt pc to my specifications and make periodic upgrades as opposed to trashing an imac every years for a new one
technology,removed,honest answer here none of the advertising on the internet is relevant to my interests especially the worthless marketing assholes that think they need to know my location via gps so they can alert me about shit i really could care less about im not saying i hate all advertising without exception i subscribe to more than a dozen magazines dead tree not digital that are targeted with a laser on my interests and i subscribe to those magazines just so i can read the advertisements those subscriptions include computer magazines home improvement magazines woodworking magazines and automotive magazines to name a few the majority of the advertising excluding the backpage anal lube cheapo ads is exactly what im looking for the targeted advertising on the internet is everything except targeted its scattershot dating and porn bullshit an actual legitimate ad might somehow sneak in there every once in a while but everyone needs to start being honest with themselves about targeted advertising on the internet websites that depend on internet advertising sell whatever ad space they can to whichever thirdparty advertising aggregator will give them the most money to allow their thirdorfourthorfifthparty suppliers to inject malware and trojans into your phone or tablet or laptop or desktop none of these websites are even remotely interested in protecting your interests if they were they would be hosting all the advertising on their own servers and they would be running av scans on it every couple of seconds in an effort to stop malware from making its way into their content but they dont so until they do everyone needs to stop pretending that online advertising has anything to do with helping the consumer

technology,removed,it has nothing to do with your isp catching you they really dont care copyright organizations such as rightscorp monitor bittorrent swarms and send notices to all of the ips found downloading there is a huge misconception that your isp mattersis the one going after you
technology,removed,they dont sue you for the amount you upload they determine the damages they suffer per download and ask you for that stopping it right after the download completes does absolutely nothing when downloading you are still apart of the swarm and actively uploading data even if you limit your client to a few kbs you will still get caught just as quickly as others if you havent been caught yet it is just luckyoure downloading torrents that are not being monitored some people seed for years and dont get caught others download half the file and get a notice all depends on the torrent some are monitored and some are not
technology,removed,so much misinformation in this thread this is completely false unless your talking about brein additionally the uploaders they target ectemely hard are not people seeding a ton of data for a long time but the actual persongroup who cappedencodedoriginally shared the file
technology,removed,ing for sources when you can find them yourself the same way everyone else would find them for you is just lazy i did and i couldnt find anything that is credible that is why i asked
technology,removed,hence the quotes around damages they will say we forecasted this much in revenue and we only got this much therefore piracy much be the reason we didnt hit our target they basically pick a number which is why they are so willing to settle for less plus court is expensive

technology,removed,how does this work on a shared ip i have lived in communities where hundreds of households had the same ip rural wireless it seems the isp would have to do a lot of network analysis and try to pin file sizes and times to an individual mac address normally i dont think theyd bother but if it were that or massive fines i bet they would

technology,removed,you use linux go for a userfriendly and accessible distro such as kubuntu mint these are just as easy to install and use as any windows if not more so and anyone telling you differently is simply spreading fud or is just plain tragically misinformed
technology,removed,i just wrote my thesis in linux but to be completely honest linux is terribly unstable compared to windows programs crashing all the time you have to fiddle good lord man have a seat are you dehydrated and overheated did you travel here from a fantasy dimension
technology,removed,i just figure theyre ms shills and dont sweat them
technology,removed,my makeshift solution to all this is to just put the machine in hibernate when im done for the day i even set the power button to hibernate it when pressed wont do anything for those popup prompts begging me to reboot but it definitely makes life easier knowing nothing can happen without my knowing about it plus since i have a fast ssd i can be up and running in about seconds from a cold even unplugged machine right back to what i was doing
technology,removed,mine reboots the first time correctly but after the second boot its just a flashing blue and black screen and windows cant fix whatever windows did to break it back on now glad the key still worked
technology,removed,what the fuck this doesnt make sense

technology,removed,thats a single example though your individual anecdotal experience doesnt necessarily represent other people the same house can cost double in one part of the country than another my friend payed a month for a large bedroom apartment with a balcony when he lived in a rural area where i live not in a big city that literally wont by you anything at all even low income housing is
technology,removed,the number i quoted was from which was the most recent data at the time i last looked thats equivalent to around in which is what the numbers show so median income hasnt changed in at least years while the cost of nearly everything has consistently risen httpsenwikipediaorgwikipersonalincomeintheunitedstates
technology,removed,yeah the figure was from which is around in dollars so to be more precise half the workers over age made less than in which means that median personal income hasnt changed in at least years while cost of living has increased substantially

technology,removed,hillarys campaign has spent on astroturfing social media her super pac even states their objective on their own website correct the record will invest more than million into barrier breakers activities including the more than tripling of its digital operation to engage in online messaging both for secretary clinton and to push back against attackers on social media platforms like twitter facebook reddit and instagram its presence is very apparent just take a look at rpolitics only prohillary and antitrump articles make it to the front page whereas hillarys wall st transcripts are all httpswwwredditcomrpoliticscontroversial despite articles in liberal news media even goes for third party candidates like jill stein and gary johnson pro articles get heavily downvoted and ridiculous hit pieces get massive upvotes this trend is a degree flip of what was there before correct the record got started
technology,removed,omg is this rtechnology or rconspiracy
technology,removed,i called out a redditor the other day that felt the need to mention they were a big bernie fan twice in a comment their comment history from more than months ago was deleted im almost certain it was just a shill account
technology,removed,its worth noting that if hillary and seemingly every country on earth is doing it the el donaldo is almost certainly doing it as well shills fighting shills the internet is a wonderful place sometimes
technology,removed,its a negative feedback loop that just keeps getting worse and worse ctr starts posting there people call them out for doing so the people crying shill are the ones that get banned rather than the actual shills ctr starts being even more blatant to try to goad people into calling them out so they can report and get them banned so now the ratio of ctr to normal users is even higher this leads to an even bigger influence and more normal users getting frustrated at the change and bowing out voluntarily which sadly only makes the problem worse its infuriating how they try to make it a tinfoil hat thing when its so obvious just look at what happened when hillary had her little health episode rpolitics went right back to the general attitudes towards hillary that it had before or during the early stages of the primaries this was because david brock admitted that they were silent because they hadnt yet received their marching orders its so fucked up
technology,removed,
technology,removed,hey look everyone a shill
technology,removed,well then that begs the question how do you stop it debate has cheapened online to the point where if anybody supports hillary theyre a ctr shill putin an fsb operative or israel a zionist puppet sure all of those types exist but its now creating suspicion of people who are genuine individual supporters it doesnt seem like true anonymity and transparency can exist together in an online space unless you are required to register an online profile with something like a ssn it seems like manufactured opinions are here to stay on the internet
technology,removed,turn away if a reasonable and informative discussion is what you were looking for all weve got here is paranoia and delusions of intellectual superiority something something le donald something something ctr something something shillrinse and repeat as needed
technology,removed,it stands for correct the record its a pac that spends millions of dollars shilling for hillary on reddit twitter and facebook
technology,removed,you are very shilly misquote trump in an egregious manner and downplay a tyrannical murderous warmonger in clinton you are just like the rest of these shills
technology,removed,its no coincidence that the big flip of rpolitics happened alongside the dnc and a lot of bad trump press yes everybodys gaming the system but people want rpolitics to fit into their preferred narrative and it just wont its just a silly place where people and bots and trolls and shills gather to oneup one another and try and rally their cause and destroy their opponents
technology,removed,your post history kind of reads like you would be a shill it makes complete sense to anyone who was active on reddit before ctr was announced there was a clear and notable shift in politics and its now become such a cess pool i imagine the only people left are ctr shills
technology,removed,the shills are many and they follow a similar script or line of reasoning it is not hard to spot them
technology,removed,shill piece of shit
technology,removed,i am listening to what youre saying i just disagree which apparently im incapable of doing without getting paid as per your original insinuation theres no way thats due to bernie supporters and was completely unthinkable before correct the record got rolling or youre wrong and people just disagree with you rpolitics comments is populated by different users depending on the time in this election cycle when people wanted bernie people who genuinely preferred hillary stayed silent because their comments would have gone against the larger narrative the sub was so excited about additionally people who liked bernies spirit but maybe disagreed with him on certain policy proposals would either voice their support for him as a candidate on the whole or be downvoted for going against the popular narrative what people who dont understand the shift in content on rpolitics is that the narrative changed when bernie was no longer a viable option what is the point in posting a probernie article now i mean really what could it possibly inform people about or accomplish it wont be popular not because paid shills are downvoting it but because its meaningless in the current context it would be equivalent to posting a prolincoln article its not news its not interesting and people are more concerned with other things
technology,removed,implying that ctr doesnt get paid several million dollars for a steady flow of obvious shilling all over reddit and halfchan when its and endless httpsiredditqjmtctoizupxpng of obviousaccounts copypasting the same typoridden lines get your head out of the sand
technology,removed,there isnt much you can do at this point except spread information about shills far and wide see rshills for your shill information needs
technology,removed,i dont believe that i believe that people swallowed the bitter pill after head cooled down post bernie endorsement of hillary
technology,removed,the mods are mostly new accounts and the old accounts for the most part seem to be paid too based on the odd voting patterns that follow their comments politics is a complete and total shill hole
technology,removed,and a brand new shiny set of shill mods to go with them
technology,removed,we can argue back and forth about which subreddits have been compromised and not get anywhere its best to just realize the fact that shills are on reddit not only do we know this for a fact it is obvious that this would be the case even without any of the information i just provided each post on reddits front page can reach several hundred thousand people up to about million per post that is comparable to a television news audience to think that the front page is all or mostly organic is insane
technology,removed,oh drat you got me no do you accuse everyone of being a shill who doesnt share your obtuse worldview
technology,removed,trump is a fucking moron with shit policy you clearly make choices with your emotions smart people make choices based on facts evidence and policy try to be like us moron
technology,removed,some evidence from twitter httpsislimghxdpptpng from ctrs website note this is old and the funding has increased to six million this isnt news at all this has been well known for months but is still being spun as a conspiracy theory if you mention it
technology,removed,actual liberals hated clinton its all shills now
technology,removed,so this might get buried but i hope it gets brought up later wouldnt governement or political facebook users and their posts be public record just like i can go down to the board of elections abd look at candidates campaign records and see they spent on signs and you can request what the invoice and that sign looked like to make sure they were not paying putin or exxon under the table how can those shill accounts not be public record there should be record of them getting money somehow if if it is a super pac i think they still have to disclose which pac the money came from if it is political advertising which it clearly is just not who exactly donated it if it is a fake shillary account wouldnt they have to say paid for by citizens for hillary or something if it was the air force wouldnt they have to state that it was a pr or a public notice and that any communication would be subject to public records requests i can see undercover agents pretending to be people they are not to try and make a drug sting but a whole government agency or figure participating in any kind of clandestine propeganda with public tax dollars sends up legal red flags all over
technology,removed,just go back to politics loser
technology,removed,your name fits the typical ctr naming scheme do you work for them hillarys echo chamber is rhillaryclinton or whatever rpolitics was entirely antihillary and establishment during the primaries with bernie i won believe they flipped to prohillary it is clear manipulation by shills like you
technology,removed,people like you probably dont have the ability to discern the difference between a shill and a normal pro hillar person in fact i would bet a lot of money you couldnt just from hillaryland
technology,removed,id like to think that a highly paid organized shill campaign wouldnt be this stupid
technology,removed,i hate trump hate hillary hate shills and hate you i dont care if youre voting johnson you posted times in this thread to say ctr isnt actually happening and that makes you a moron
technology,removed,haha bernie or bust means never hillary nice to see the shills expanding maybe youll destroy reddit
technology,removed,i do think that institutions are becoming more aware of the power of online narratives and more able to shape them but i also think a lot of the paranoia about shills and astroturfing reflects the increased balkanization of the internet where people selfsegregate into echo chambers and then are shocked when their opinions are downvotedrepudiated in more open forums sometimes its just that a lot of people disagree with you incessantly crying wolf because the most unpopular candidate in presidential history is has been taking a beating adds a lot of noise to the signal
technology,removed,this is what the shills have been saying when they dont have a good counter argument not saying youre a shill btw
technology,removed,it upset me because valid opinions are often silenced here with the reasoning that they are shills instead of trying to engage in a discussion with them in case youre serious about me being a shill you can just take a look at my postcomment history and see that the majority of my comments are not political and im using this username pretty much everwhere
technology,removed,what about that whole luckey shill thing
technology,removed,you do realize this makes every user less likely to have rational discussion as everyone with an opposing opinion is labeled a shill right
technology,removed,everyone who disagrees with me is either a bot or a shill its the only possible explanation who could disagree with a genius such as i s
technology,removed,now that this thread has hit the front page they might be sending some shills over to correct the record
technology,removed,what about that whole luckey shill thing
technology,removed,just like putins shills and bernies shills and trumps shills etc its amazing to hear people complain about the other side influencing opinion through social media without acknowledging that their side does it too in this day and age you would have to be completely incompetent to run a campaign without a social media presence
technology,removed,i rarely post because theres no benefit in debating with people who resort to accusing her supporters as shills i dont think shes perfect but i do think shell be a competent president i say this as a former moderate republican i hate the path the gop has chosen to take since bills presidency but i didnt expect it to sink this low trump is an embarrassment on a scale i never seriously believed wed inflict on ourselves
technology,removed,this idea is why people assume hillary supporters are all shills but its not true basically everyone i know is a hillary voter and most are excited for vote for her including people well to her left like myself shes got tons of relevant experience and shes got an exciting inclusive vision for america theres always compromises when voting for a candidate and shes not perfect but im excited to vote for her and so are lots of people in my social circles
technology,removed,yes people who make vague shillesque accusation on reddit as if they have the faintest fucking clue whether any particular comment is someone passionate paid for articulate because they were educated have time or a thesaurus or inarticulate because they are busy or dont care or dont know then people like you the people that do the actions that you do so people like you group these drops they couldnt really tell apart into an entire stormtrend to complain about online on the same forum are you a trump shill durrr obviously shills exist their entire job is to fly under the radar if they are any good at it the likes of you wont be the one to find out who is who it sucks but pretending you have any reading whatsoever on which direction is hiring more or who is who is fucking ridiculous i have been called a shill or so times defending israel i was raised jewish and lived there and it gets an extremely disproportionate amount of hate on reddit or anywhere remotely liberal so i defend it a lot so yes i find the shillaccusing a bit trigger happy here
technology,removed,i mean im sure there are some nonpaid rpolitics shills but hillary clinton openly admits she spent millions of dollars on correct the record it would be insane to think that spending that much money wouldnt have a visible effect
technology,removed,you give millions of dollars to a group of people and have them day in and day out buying and creating accounts and shilling directing discussion it works
technology,removed,you must be a shill trying to play the tinfoil hat card
technology,removed,the admins are liberals themselves and want the shills to continue shilling for hillary the bernie subreddit was spamming the top of rall for like months and they never gave a shit then the donald subreddit starts hitting the top of rall for like a month and the admins literally changed the entire voting algorithm of the site to remove them from reaching rall as often there was also evidence that they specifically devalued upvotes on that subreddit alone the admins are liberal shills
technology,removed,the trump tape dropped at nice try though wikileaks was clearly a response to the trump tape not the other way around and there is no comparison of the damage done by either one for the record i am not a shill
technology,removed,the ctr shills on reddit are actual people and they vote manipulate and have anything negative about hillary deleted
technology,removed,lol ok this guys a shill
technology,removed,im super pro hillary now but also supported bernie during the primaries ive got years of posting history plenty of pro hillary anti trump stuff not just in rpolitics and yet ive been called a shill a bunch apparently even stating ive been called a shill signals me as a shill its stupid and exhausting
technology,removed,look in this thread donnies shills have infested it
technology,removed,i think its sunday and a more than half the shill squad are taking a day off monday the shill force will be fully in effect unfortunately
technology,removed,thats a new thing mods are democrats more than hillary shills on the days coming up to the primaries when it was pretty clear bernie was getting shafted it wasnt too unpopular in rpolitics to say maybe we should vote for trump that was before he went full granddragon and the most glaring policy was the yuuge wall
technology,removed,well first you need a million dollar budget then you pay people to shill quite simple fact is trump barely has a ground campaign so hes probably not in the business of astroturfing rthedonald is pretty much a containment sub at this point only a few posts make it to rall after the change in the algorithm so other redditors barely see it anymore
technology,removed,you might legitimately have autism

technology,removed,there is an optionbut its not at all obvious and purposefully so
technology,removed,hey dickface i only need to ssh into the clusters to do my work why the fuck does it matter
technology,removed,yes fuckface thats exactly what i meant when i clicked no to the upgrade and when i said i use windows on my surface book it means asshat that i know what the appropriate software is and that i do not want microsoft to make the decision for me because no means no dumbfuck does that make sense or is your programmer mind too small to hold that definition maybe need to download some ram shithead
technology,removed,go choke on a bag of dicks
technology,removed,the start menu is back no its not the windows start menu is a huge drop in usability compared to the menu
technology,removed,connects to watsontelemetrymicrosoftcom connects to ocatelemetrymicrosoftcom
technology,removed,microsoft has made a lot of effort recently to win the minds of open source advocates save perhaps the orthodox microsoft wont win the minds of open source advocates unless they release an open source os while they keep putting out proprietary software they cant be trusted releasing a closed source os laden with adware spyware and telemetry and then trying to take over computers with it is about the scummiest most dishonest despicable thing they could have done none of that should ever be implemented as core features of an os they want total control over your pc they dont want you to use your pc as you see fit its absolutely disgusting
technology,removed,i had automatic updates turned off and had no traces of windows shit on my computer gwx yet the windows files still installed in the backgroud without my permission luckily it couldnt install on restart because i edited the registry so it cant do so but its amazing how they installed it right under my nose despite gwx being run and having update set to manual any update i installed were security only and i didnt take their word for it either i checked every single individual update to check they were all security patches so that means windows told me to go fuck myself and overruled user settings to background install windows os files while i was sat there watching netflix or some shit now i leave monitor mode on in gwx to be absolutely sure its the only way to be safe
technology,removed,requires a huge amount of knowledge pop in linux mint you can be up and running whole os installed within clicks lxde or xfce is just as easy as winmac you never even need to touch a cmd line but also a condescending prick you have ample judgement for me because i can enjoy my computer but where is your judgement for microsoft who causes their users such pain if im a prick you and all other windows users are masochists you are literally stupid for using that os
technology,removed,im not sure why you got so many negative votes for suggesting that people are responsible for what the business that they work for does so take an upvote my guess is all the people who downvoted you would use the tired old phrase dont blame me im just doing my job
technology,removed,i consider windows to be malware in the degree it monitors your activity and reports back to ms this is one reason as a privacy expert i advise my clients to avoid it
technology,removed,you do realize httpswwwsafernetworkingorgspybotantibeacon fixes of the issues you just listed
technology,removed,its objectively better than but not im sticking with i tried out windows struggled with how awful it was for about a week then decided to go back to
technology,removed,even the upgrade to windows popups didnt bother me it was just there not doing anything i think youll find there are quit a few people who had their pc shutdown forcefully out of no where and windows just started installing some asshole says hurr hurr but you had automatic updates turned on yeah because that means i want my pc shut off in the middle of a game
technology,removed,rtheisbillgates needs to go back and fix this
technology,removed,ill get it one sec sifting through hillarys emails
technology,removed,again
technology,removed,fuck reddit and fuck sanders

technology,removed,youre probably in a non mhz market look into that and when tmobile deploys in your area give them another shot their signal coverage has greatly improved in the past two years
technology,removed,no problem its your loss tmobile will constantly improve their service and offer more freebies
technology,removed,i understand i can definitely get a cheaper plan with any of the mvno and smaller carriers in my area but i would rather pay more and go with a national carrier like tmobile who is and will change the industry for the better through their uncarrier moves you can probably tell im a tmobile fan
technology,removed,nope just laying out facts my best friend does this theres enough out there for it to be plausible
technology,removed,tmobile raped my mother and killed my father

technology,removed,yes but some people fuck up more from negligence and a lack of thinking than mere accident if we could convince people in society to pay a bit more attention to what theyre doing we wouldnt have to have such batshit insane laws that assume everyone is stupid which does lead to more and more people becoming stupid
technology,removed,– the logs dont lie regardless of the fact that the driver may well have been at fault here thats a huge fucking assumption and it assumes that the engineering of the log collection is perfect im kind of incredulous that your average idiot as this halo effect over tesla that they have with apple while actually having no basis in reality to support that effect apart from marketing and hero worship

technology,removed,in case anyone is wondering no data caps do not solve congestion congestion is a function of bandwidth not data it is saturation of bandwidth this is a result of isps offering more bandwidth than they can actually handle at once and is called overselling this an sich is not bad granted measures are in place to prevent congestion the main measure utilized mostly is dynamic bandwidth throttling during congestion meaning everyone gets a bit lower bandwidth to keep the lines stable this is common so congestion is already solved no data caps on mobile networks are not justified either mobile networks and cable networks are limited in the exact same way bandwidth for neither type of network it matters how much data it has already send you hell lets go even further for literally any kind of information transfer ranging from telecommunication to even quantum mechanics shizzle bandwidth is the limited factor data is unlimited so long as the universe hasnt died from the heat death reaching maximum entropy no is not a justification for data caps either there is no technical justification for them but muh business decision yes thats the reason not the justification

technology,removed,all that is very true plus add the fact that im a social retard who would rather hunt bbs confusing shelf arrangements for something obscure i need for an hour than talk to one of their high school kids
technology,removed,netflix knows exactly how many episodes you watched of what in what order if you rewatched any episodes if you rewound at all and exactly when you stopped watching a show they know your relevant demography from your tastes and they know your tastes down to the minute yes but they dont know how much time im spending browsing reddit with a show on in the background also more seriously look at something like ascension one season then cancelled on a huge cliffhanger except i havent actually watched it i desperately want them to commission another season before i get invested in the first one although i already know all the spoilers so from their analytics im not interested in ascension yet i actually am and id really like a new season

technology,removed,you should go grab yourself a great big cup of dicks and shove it up your ass
technology,removed,whats your proposed solution for the government to legally prohibit service providers from curating and censoring their own platforms any legal solution would mean the government is now telling nongovernmental entities what they can and cannot allow to be expressed on their own platform to scale it down if i ran a forum and censored content i didnt want to see should the government be able to force me to allow everyone to express their views if they did so how is being compelled to do something by the government any better the only solution is for there to be an alternative social network that was strictly anticensorship of any sort and that would require market forces
technology,removed,did someone say bacon
technology,removed,you dont carry a cell phone wow you are pretty much in full tinfoil territory do you have a faraday cage in your house so you can calm down are you constantly on like vpns and proxies when you are on the internet like holy fuck you are paranoid
technology,removed,just rubs me the wrong way that our government uses our tax dollars to buy office supplies that these companies sell for a profit
technology,removed,i think we need to be very careful about advocating for there to be a governmental or legal solution to the issue as that would necessitate the government deciding whether certain forms of speech are allowed or not and being able to compel nongovernmental entities to do its bidding
technology,removed,you must be some kind of country bumpkin if this actually works where you live this would just make traffic even more of a hell in any fairly populated area

technology,removed,who fills those out usually you well not you p opt in for a goodie lead magnet like gratis ebooks or other stuff or the newsletter if youre really interested in the topic and trust the business sadly many businesses or marketers dont research their audience in marketer talk a lead is somebody who comes to their site you youre not seen as a person but dehumanized by branding you through marketing lingo as lead this sets them up to not think of you as a person thats the whole problem of online marketing today dehumanizing humans always leads to shit like that thats how wars work at fault is business education creating this mindset in first place winds are changing though theres a counter culture to that called experience design ux

technology,removed,no im not i am simply asking a intriguing question its not like a came up with the scenario on its own some of the top universities in the country are working on this problem as we speak i just think its a fascinating topic so crashes are going to happen its unavoidable the question is merely do we program the cars to minimize the chances of death overall if others are involved or do we only care about making sure the driver is safe and not worry about the car making such a decision in the first place

technology,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
technology,removed,how is technology supposed to answer what people arent able to and why should i trust some random student community instead when people are willfully ignorant and dont care to inform themselves about the news source or the platform theyre using and what settings it offers you are helpless there has been a drama about personalized google search results only because people dont even care to check the available explanations features and settings and if you dont want to remove but ignore your cookies you can just open a private browser window and visit google news for instance instead of fighting a temporarily popular technology you should train your children your citizens etc in critical thinking

technology,removed,everything is overengineered by the engineers fresh out of college that never got their hands dirty in the past with grumman for example if something didnt fit perfectly or some holes were too tight their techs would hammer it in or just open up the hole a to make it fit just pure common sense not anymore something has a tolerance after paint or plating have you considered what the tolerance means to the rcs engineer or considered how much lo maint can be saved if said tolerances are accomplished at the mfg level or perhaps instead of complaining about you actually brag about how youre involved in an environment that can not only produce materials with such tolerances but that can do so in serial production
technology,removed,well yeah stealth aircraft have much lower maint requirements when the airframe itself is constructed to specific tolerances
technology,removed,the went from prototype to production model in years and the capabilities of that production model was limited to what again in what time period against what primary threats the of today is the result of decades of ongoing modifications and upgrades based on evolving threats any new weapons platform re jsf thus has to enter ioc with the sensor and weapon capabilities that it took the decades to refine

technology,removed,everyone is mentioning how good it is that their children dont have brand loyalty or see flashing colors and lights constantly no one is talking about how good it is that your kids arent being poisoned by ads for things that are sugar its an insidious substance that is absolutely more addictive than of the drugs your kids will encounter and the advertisers know it which is why they target kids specifically its also why they lobby to get fast food chains installed in middle schools remember advertisers arent just annoying theyre evil they will trade your childs health for money and sleep soundly at night anything and everything you can do to make them miserable is justified
technology,removed,
technology,removed,absolutely correct but without ads you at least have some control you can raise them with the mindset of sweats being a once in a while treat rather than something in every part of the meal but when every seconds you see some smiling family of fit people guzzling soda and eating brownies afterward its easy to think thats normal its highly addictive because of the reasons you listed if our advertisers had even the smallest atom morality they wouldnt market a highly addictive substance to children

technology,removed,i was watching there were no threatening comments and i would urge the mods of rapple to post proof that there were several of the mods are apple employees and it is thought that the apple public relations team ordered it to be locked the thread has been upvoted over times after being locked which indicates there is a great deal of interest in continuing the discussion

technology,removed,so we can expect more
technology,removed,firstly rtechnology is one of the biggest political campaigning subreddits since it was destroyed by a mob and taken over a couple of years ago im not sure why you dont realise this are you new secondly this is a tech article and i carefully picked out the key technological interest with a specific quote thirdly the technology discussion here explaining what dkim implies and what it does not imply has been very insightful and really helps my understanding of the article i am pretty sure comments like the ones here would not exist or be buried on a political subreddit so this isnt really bullshit its just a pity that this technological discussion isnt going to achieve the same visibility as which dont really dwell on the underlying technology finally im sorry and thankyou for correcting the record
technology,removed,after two generations of devices with gpu defects and apples shit cs dealing with them having to be sued just to act and then only replacing parts with more defective parts and stalling i gave up on them and went to linux yes its some effortbut now i have so much more freedom i have the same os running on a year old laptop and a brand new desktop i can choose from most hardware out there i can customize things i dont even know i can customize yet if i ever want or need to i can download and try many other versions of the os on a live usb for free and installreinstall them for free if i like them or they work better with my hardwarebut i dont have to relearn an entire system as they are all linux i am not interested in servers or building arch from scratch and doubt i ever will be i just wanted a complete os for my daily drivers and to be free of apples bullshit and didnt want to go back to windows
technology,removed,it is but its more trouble than its worth especially on a laptop its a lot of workwill break often with updatesand is generally a hobby thing for people who like the challenge if you want unix you are far better off going to one of the many great linux distros
technology,removed,i did the same thing times before i fully went for it things have improved a lot in just the last few years even they are light years ahead from say ten years ago i nearly didnt try again because of how poor my first two experiences were trying to get things to work there will be moments of i cant do this if anything rarely does go wrong and people are talking about the terminal and config filesbut you actually can do it and its not as hard as it sounds
technology,removed,nobody is going to be unable to believe we wanted a transition period for currently prolific ports and the dont give a fuck about the economics of laptop design they buy mbps like us plebes buy a piece of bubblegum its a disposable commodity to them that they dont even feel in the pocketbook and have zero economic attachment to like we do to our laptops
technology,removed,the is incredulity at your idiotic smugness indexing on a seam where the keyboard meets the touch strip isnt at all as good as indexing on a physical key
technology,removed,this can all be solved by having all the ports on the charger my vaio has a usb port on the charger add a hmdi and ethernet and your good to go you have your super slim laptop and you still have your ports
technology,removed,why did they introduce the lighting connector apple has a long history of proprietary connectors that offer the same functionality as industry standard ones the move to usbc is apples new role as follower not leader computers phones this is apple surrendering this is apple grasping at relevance

technology,removed,youre not going to replace your webcam who the fuck uses an external usb powered webcam on their laptop have you seen the quality of built in webcams theyre absolute fucking shit however that was just an example of older devices that you would have to use an adapter for usba is still going to be utilized for the next decade whether you think so or not there are far too many legacy devices that require it that includes wireless adapters for mice and keyboard which are the size of usba ports unless the only devices you use are your phone and laptop chances are you will have another item with usba plugs that you wont replace until it breaks its retarded to switch completely over to usbc right now maybe in the next years unless you have money to burn for now they can go the way of other companies and do usba and usbc like on my lenovo thinkpad which has and usbc along with a bunch of other functional ports but to bank everything on usbc right now is just as stupid as going for all usba plugs
technology,removed,this guy gets it fuck the cia
technology,removed,i think for some stories you are probably right but there is still a lot of reporting that is done carefully and thoughtfully most reporters are professionals that care about their craft and understand their role the issue comes from the editors and executives of the organizations who are serving a profit motive two sets of people in an organization are oftentimes serving two masters truth and money the latter drives the behavior you reference politically though its popular to shit on the media because they can prevent or expose politicians shenanigans so you get people like trump who encourage media bashing and even single then out at rallies for ridicule or scorn theres a reason authoritative governments squelch the press or imprison journalists and why theyre called the branch or government a free society must have a free press
technology,removed,its still much much easier to scrub carbon emissions where theyre being produced at the coal fired power station for example than it is to scrub them for each and every end user per petrol powered car for example
technology,removed,how many coal plants use scrubbers zero actually no figures are a little out of date now but even in about of stations had scrubbers httpwwwsourcewatchorgindexphpscrubberretrofitsatexistingcoalplants that percentage will only have increased since then

technology,removed,honestly from an it perspective the start to your response is just fucking stupid i hate getting into backforth on message boards but this response and claiming some expansive knowledge because of years in this industry means almost exclusively nothing one person has already pointed out how they can be a simple quick diag tool if you are supposed to be getting and you run a test on a few different sites and cant even pull a descent number when they are running usually closest or faster server they use for these testsyou are saying those results mean nothing do they fix the problem nothey can verify ones there with clicks whether it be temporary issue or something else they tell a nontechnical person even if its maybe i should rebootif that doesnt work or it doesnt get better tomorrow i will call tech support you want to throw a bunch of fancy shit out there that is better for you but not for the a person that knows hisher internet should work and a number should come back close to what theyre paying for but you realize what that nontech person will run into when they get online and start googling how to fix this and that they will see reboot try this try that and break shit trying to be technical or use cmds you listed and have no fucking clue what they are seeing how it matters what it matters what they are seeing and continue googling more solutions with more technical replies and fuck something up more than it was yeah there are better tools but you cant say they provide nothing but you also stated years that like matters nice you know x years of knowledge on shit that isnt even relevant anymore not saying years around tech in general means nothingim saying claiming as an it guy means nothing i know people that have sat on a help desk for years cause theyre content with that does that really mean they possess a ton of knowledge and keep up with current tech you can go into a breakdown of all your years if you want to defend yourself it wont change the fact speedtest sites are not in fact useless just points to it probably takes you longer to solve a problem than other it guys
technology,removed,the stain was on the people who commented and voted on reddit in that instance reddit can disavow what its readers post as long as it doesnt simultaneously take responsibility for what readers post
technology,removed,posts this as well
technology,removed,for what its worth out of the three mods who were talking to me in that modmail discussion i think you were honestly attempting to be civil and reasonable and though i was not pleased with the outcome of that discussion i understand it may have not been entirely up to you i was getting insulted and attacked by the two other mods and you would ask for something i would provide it and the other mods would say that it was irrelevant it was extremely frustrating edit as you can see from ops modmail post the kinds of comments we could find were all along these lines i asked twice for them to provide some examples of comments that didnt break the rules were happy to revisit bans but in doing so if we find that a user consistently breaks our rules it is hard to justify unbanning them i went through over ten pages of user history it is not unreasonable to expect that op do some of the grunt work in finding example comments were still happy to revisit the issue but op needs to help us there show us that you can adhere to our rules and be a productive member of the sub again to bash me for rule breaking comments that were not rule breaking at the time they were posted is unfair its also unfair to ask me to do something reddits tools make it impossible to do if i ask a question relevant to the post and it only gets upvotes thats absolutely something that would fall within what youre asking for but i have no way to find those kinds of comments ive been an active user for years i did the best i could with reddits limited tools i provided you with a few examples and i was told they were irrelevant ive spent more time than i probably should have going through ops history on our sub they used to comment frequently up until about years ago when they took a break from our sub some of those comments like this one were pretty egregious i agree with you that seems really bad i dont even know what to say i cant imagine why i would have posted that i went through and couldnt find that comment as previously discussed reddit doesnt provide a way for me to search my user history can you provide me with a permalink to that post i want to make sure that it wasnt clearly sarcastic in context or something i honestly cant imagine why i would have made that comment anyway the reason i stopped commenting as frequently years ago is because rscience started to impose stricter rules which i believe was the intended effect the joke posts i made years ago were no longer okay so i didnt make them or i skirted the line sometimes however when they started commenting again more recently while many were removed for violating rules they were not hateful they were therefore not on our radar until the transgender rule reminder post again my post in response to the transgender rule reminder post is being characterized as hateful when still no one has offered a rational explanation as to why it was anything of the sort i disagree with the policy not because i support the banned argument but for the same reason i disagree with your policy on climate change and flat earthers and such i think discussion is important and useful and i think assuming ignorance is the same as malice is wrong i was not the moderator who banned op but i was obviously part of the moderating team on the pms that looked into it as such im going to suggest a review by the moderating team members who were not involved in the ban or review in any way ive provided the comments i found in their history and various conversations for them to look at we request that op modmail us to discuss the issue and acknowledge our rules other not previously involved moderators will take it from there ustufff please do this at your convenience my ban has now been overturned to the extent that was partly your doing i sincerely appreciate it i want to put this whole issue behind me i still disagree with the mod position on this and some other issues but i can accept that my individual opinion on it doesnt trump what the mod team has decided and move on i just wont talk about these issues in rscience any more
technology,removed,just read the instructions i believe it was originally called rtfm until someone figured out what the f stood for is based on the west coast for launches from vandenburg of course i still love you or ocisly is based on the east coast for launches from canaveral
technology,removed,so that the other two will be able to pick up the slack of a third that becomes weak for whatever reason
technology,removed,there are a couple of things here this mission was to send satellites to gto this type of orbit requires the rocket goes faster and higher than a more normal leo because of this increased speed the amount of energy involved is a lot higher as kinetic energy is the square of the velocity on missions going to gto all the rockets need to be working as a failure will mean that the stage hasnt decelerated enough to make a controlled landing
technology,removed,vandenburg is generally used for satellites that are intended to orbit north to south instead of the more normal west to east spacex is also gearing up its own launch facility in boca chica in texas which will probably mean another barge will need to be constructed at some point and if their plans for falcon heavy continue as it is theres a planned test launch later this year i can see a couple extra barges being needed especially if they want to land both boosters and the first stage
technology,removed,there are several cameras on the barge but only one is linked to the satellite for transmission purposes to get the footage from the other cameras involves going onboard the barge and retrieving the footage and transmitting that that can take a few days depending on the condition of the barge and the footage
technology,removed,theyre putting it outside the spacex factory in hawthorne ca
technology,removed,i take it that you are aware that the landing rocket is over tall and weighs over tonnes its also travelling at a couple hundred miles an hour until very shortly before landing id love to see the catchers mitt that could cope with those parameters
technology,removed,the ones that landed successfully wont be reused anyways actually elons plan at the moment is to reuse one of the landed stages inaround september the reason for the delay at the moment is that they need to work out the logistics for recertifying that the landed stage is good to fly again after all noones done that before
technology,removed,its not supposed to be a legitimate argument as to whether the earth is flat or spherical this is a creative debate exercise the entire point is to be given an impossible premise to handle and defend to the best of your ability stop circlejerking and falling for the obvious setup argue like you believe it we all know the earth isisnt flat

technology,removed,because the internet is more than just netflix yes its a shitload of bandwidth but just because its a large amount of data doesnt mean its important data the internet represents the freedom of communication that is a basic human right written into our constitution the internet is the last bastion of uncensored truth that humanity has as a whole the ability to communicate with people tens of thousands of miles away both simultaneously and instantly is priceless and a threat to net neutrality is a threat to the entire worlds social progress think of chinas heavily monitored internet and how difficult it is for them to really know whats going on in their own governmentand think of how much trouble were having here in the usand who is ultimately going to come out on top even if the uneducated are blind and just want cheaper netflix it is the duty of those who know better to stand up as leaders to offer guidance because quite frankly were better off working together as a species
technology,removed,honest question why do you think data caps are crock water gas electric and even minutes and texts are all charged by meters and tiered caps data at its core is an exchange of heatenergy and no energy is free so we have to pay for it somehow i agree i think the data caps now are arbitrary numbers meant for money grabs its total horse shit that theyre just milking us consumers dry because face it nobody lives without internet now its become a basic need just like water and electricity a house without internet is fucking barbaric back to my point i guess i dont think data caps are inherently bad but i do think their current implementations are pretty fucking shitty
technology,removed,appealing to the uneducated class the uneducated consider snowden their hero they think a dell repairman is smarter than the experts at the nsa thats why they like to ignore the snowden revelations that show filters that actually exclude us citizens data from collections by the nsa it really becomes a brain teaser for the uneducated when asked to resolve the inherent contradiction that the snowden leaks show filters removing us citizens communications data from their perception of mass privacy invasion by the nsa the mental gymnastics they go through to try and explain away that is amazing

technology,removed,we need to end the various wars on the people of this country the war on drugs give the police an excuse to violate our physical privacy the war on terror gives the authorities an excuse to violate our digital privacy there is also a third thing that the government uses to infringe on our forth amendment rights im sure much of reddit will not like to hear it but it is the income tax the income tax gives the government an excuse to violate our financial privacy for instance im sure most people know that any deposit into a bank over dollars must be reported to the government also if you have any foreign financial accounts they must be reported to the government annually including amount held and even the account number the income tax needs to be replaced with some other kind of tax
technology,removed,now how about a list of the antidemocratic forces that have infiltrated our political establishment possibly from foreign intelligence agencies like saudi arabian and other violent middle eastern scum and scum funded by their oil money who were stopped in this case by our ancestors and the constitution they wrote for us just so that the fbi knows who to jail when people like comey are arrested by their underlings and prosecuted for treason

technology,removed,i gotta agree with you hereeverything turned on all the time and use google search ok google multiple times a day i have a nexus device and always update everything asap on my phone i let google totally have its way with me i also follow the android community and google as a whole for over a decade now googles customized search resultssuggestions are really good they use a huge variety of metrics and a stupidly massive pile of data to decide what you are looking for however i have never seen any evidence that google is listening when it hasnt been given permission too ie ok google if google was someone from the android community would notice really fast the community is chock full of computer nerds who get off on analyzing anything and everything their phone does also parsing voice data into data that google can process speech recognition is computationally expensive your phone cant really do it on its own so it doesnt whenever you hit that microphone button or say ok google your phone opens an audio stream to googles servers and sends the audio to them to process server side this uses data and if google was parsing everything you said around your phone all the time it would be blatantly obvious on two fronts first your phone wouldnt be able to sleep the cpu would need to be awake constantly in order to process the sound the mics are picking up yes i know what youre thinking ill come back to that second there would need to be a constant data stream going out from your phone both of these things would be very obvious to any android power user the last thing is the legal implications nowhere in googles privacy policy do they say they are always listening and recording everything the mics are capable of picking up yes i have read the fine print google runs a huge risk of running afoul of wiretapping laws and puts themselves in a ripe position of a barrage of lawsuits if it comes out that they are secretly recording everything its really not worth it for them to risk it ok going back to the mics always being on yes they actually always are on and technically they are always listening however they can only really hear one thing your phone has dedicated lowpower hardware that only tries to match what it hears a waveform to a keyword a preset waveform think of it like a lock whose key is a specific waveform any key that doesnt fit is discarded
technology,removed,fuck the eu bunch of pussies
technology,removed,yes i am sure you can really hear the difference and from your link the wireless headphones themselves are fully capable of replicating the same quality as wired devices however the absence of this feature comes from the wireless signal the vast majority of wireless headphones use bluetooth which was not initially designed with highdefinition audio streaming in mind oh look it is for shitty headphones only

technology,removed,using a throwaway here because this directly relates to what i do first off im active special forces and this is my years experience opinion in this scenario the active army will have some deserters but its hard to put a percentage on it most of the military does what its told and puts the lotion on the skin much like nazi germany they will do unimaginable things because of orders duty and its their job its how they make money if they route they lose everything they wont do so unless it is absolutely last resort reservist and national guard have a life a job most likely they will choose what they believe vs what they have to do at the end of the day they are still a pharmacist laywer burger flipper special operations is the game changer one of our many jobs is to take a few guys lets say and make an army we do so by going into a foreign country with government issues find a group who believes in the values we want to enforce we have little to no resources very particular set of skills ie multiple languages job knowledge survival field craft without going into specifics a man or a few men or can create an army of a hundred thousand or thousands with our knowledge and in turn we are the insurgents that overthrow the current government all that said our guys arent all going to route but many will we dont have the same mentality as the regular military we have other skills that make us valuable versus just being a infantryman most of us are successful civilians who wear the uniform because of what we believe not for a job this is why the ammendment is so important you take weaponsyou take our ability to defend against a tyrannical government now of course we make our own and have other means of obtaining them but how much easier if everyone already has one all i have to do is train you how to properly use it in many scenarios basically we will convince and train like minded americans to fuck the governments ass

technology,removed,so all our government needs is an information exchange agreement with some other countries and they can obtain information about us that would be illegal and unethical for them to gather themselves since its coming from a foreign government its fine because foreign spying is every countrys right oh wait that already exists the former nsa contractor edward snowden described the five eyes as a supranational intelligence organisation that doesnt answer to the known laws of its own countries documents leaked by snowden in revealed that the fvey have been spying on one anothers citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive domestic regulations on surveillance of citizens

technology,removed,theres some kingsmen shit going on here
technology,removed,thank you for saving the children based netflix they also save kids from car accidents and pedophiles every times they skip going to a movie theater for a movie night at home with netflix such heroes
technology,removed,why would they sit on it for over a year and then say it was from earth doesnt make sense if that was the case why did it take days after publication of the story for it to be debunked by a random ass website
technology,removed,i think spacex is the only one to test fire their rockets on the pad i imagine the damage to their launch facility is going to be extensive
technology,removed,is there no audible warning autopilot disengagedresume manual control etc
technology,removed,im fully in favor of municipal broadband and i think its extremely shitty that this kind of suit was even needed in the first place as far as who we need to give authority to i have no idea i just know that we do need new legislation to fix the problem if states are going to continue to be this shitty about it
technology,removed,i was just asking what the warnings are beeping and flashing takes some time to interpret if it doesnt happen often to me a clear verbal direction like take manual control now etc is best in such situations
technology,removed,if this is a troll post you should plug it back in let it warm up for a few minutes and then begin to poke it with a knife to let out all of the pressure you will then experience a more efficient battery in your laptop
technology,removed,for the first time in the history of web browsers people can now seamlessly reward the sites whose content they value and wish to support while remaining untracked by anyone including us at brave software inc this removes the need for intermediaries who may overwhelm web pages with invasive trackers and ads and sometimes even malware it also avoids centrally managed feed algorithms that may or may not value your idea of content quality
technology,removed,an influencer is someone who has an authority or influence over their audience in a specific niche a lot of social media followers is nice but not necessary sometimes someone can have more influence with fewer followers
technology,removed,exc ept she didnt break any laws and didnt lie about it the fbi said she was careless but plenty of people used private servers in her position eg rice in fact during a congressional enquiry in hillary clintons email case

technology,removed,be careful with torrents anti piracy groups monitor torrents and then send notices to your isp they can disconnect your service because its against their tos basically the only way to get back at them is to fuck every executive of att in the ass unlubed knowing them they would like that
technology,removed,it is down for the moment ill get back to you when it is up again
technology,removed,hello rtechnology came across this post and just wanted to let everyone know that our team has made ourselves available to answer any product questions from the community and well be actively monitoring the comments section hope to be of help
technology,removed,good question if you preorder today you will be charged today for the amount of tax and shipping
technology,removed,i knew one of the guys working on that deal and a similar one before to expand cellphone coverage across the country he thought it was hilarious how they were just pocketing the money
technology,removed,its becoming more and more apparent we cant trust these shifty eyed chinamen was a sad day indeed when the once great ibm sold its soul to foreign communists these people will never understand the concept of consumer protection
technology,removed,comparison tests have indeed been done with a hepa filter the industry standard by molekule as well as third parties please see the results on the website molekulecom
technology,removed,we completely agree a randomized placebo control trial would be the gold standard in our minds unfortunately as a small start up with limited resources we were not able to carry this out while our data is limited we have stated in the paper that our goal and hope would be to expand this study to better understand the effects of our technology however i will note in similar studies done on hepa filters see paper here observing actual symptom reductions have been unclear and controversial our initial results point to a signal and the possibility to in fact reduce allergy symptoms not saying this is clinical proof we would want to further evaluate as you suggested but points in a positive direction for further study for the actual technology comparisons on various pollutants we have done these tests comparing to both hepa and carbon filters on various pollutants see here httpmolekulecomtechnology
technology,removed,why is this good news i use spotify daily and am happy it exists
technology,removed,those little buttons for things in the house completely retarded just give me a single web interface where i can order what i need i dont need hardware buttons all over the house just to do that prime pantry looks somewhat promising but right now im literally miles from a grocery store so why bother with the extra cost of delivery and such especially when i dont get to pick out my own veggies im already out and about in my car for my job why should i pay someone else to ship me stuff that i can go get myself
technology,removed,nice
technology,removed,it is about time this happens
technology,removed,great points all around to answer some of your questions we have tested our unit and have found the noise range is approximately dba this is measured roughly meter away from the device which is the standard for these types of devices laboratory testing of the two filters yields air flow resistances which correlate with a flow rate of cfm at max speed a large percentage of our allergyasthma beta testers already had hepa units in their home these users found substantial symptom score reduction throughout their trial we hope to continue testing in the coming months and share the results
technology,removed,that study is dumb on several levels
technology,removed,except you do agree to it and there the standard x button in the top right like always thats what microsoft will point to this to back up their argument that its voluntary and only done with the users consent i doubt well get another class action like we did with the browser wars plus if you installed windows you agreed to microsofts eulatos which stipulates a class action waiver iirc
technology,removed,we just fucking stopped sopa in america which was extremely beneficial to anyone accessing sites anywhere because we set a precedent that those kinds of archaic laws are bullshit and arent going to fly but no lets just accept this as fact instead of properly being pissed off that a government agency is telling us we arent allowed to view something privately in our own homes that harms no one in the production of said commodity nor the mind that views it if youre gonna fucking outlaw porn you better legalize brothels and safe prostitution then asinine pieces of shit those in power over in britain are my god why the hell havent any of you thrown protests yet if trump banned porn i would like to think half his supporters would finally see the light on his bullshit
technology,removed,betternet
technology,removed,its crazy how accepted this stuff is now the other day i was playing the nameless mod at one point in the game the objective is to infiltrate a building and plant a spyware device on some servers when you look at the spyware device it is called a gator followed by some numbers what is the significance of this there was a piece of software about sixteen years ago called gator which was widely accused of being spyware needless to say when i saw this gag i cracked up its a brilliant joke that will sail over the heads of most people who play the game and it makes me wonder how many jokes in this game are sailing over my head too that i didnt catch

technology,removed,youre a fucking idiot
technology,removed,thats the equivalent of saying you dont care about freedom of the press because you dont read the paper not an insult but if you dont get that you dont understand the issue at all its not about controlling prices or bandwidth its about controlling who gets to speak and who doesnt you being alive before the internet was a thing does not excuse you not understanding this just like saying la la la la la i cant hear you doesnt make you any less wrong

technology,removed,then you should know for future reference that a rather large chunk of republicans in politics and the media were complicit in the bush email scandal that by scale makes the hillary email scandal seem like absolutely nothing its weird the republicans didnt make a peep about any of that or about how half their candidates were either involved with the bush administration or had their own scandalsjeb also has an email scandal from his time at florida governor but now theyre like the worst thing ever its weird because its exactly reversed when compared to the whole lying thing which in the was absolutely the worst thing and bill must be impeached yet a couple years later when bushcheneyrumsfeld lies us into a war theres no problem and then once hillarys involved the mere idea that she may have lied about something related to benghazisomething that happened times during the bush years its absolutely abhorrent and must be dealt with by forming something like investigative committees to look into it its insane and at this point anyone that even repeats anything like hillary is suuuuper bad mmmmkay is an instant signal that youre either a troll a shill or so out of the loop regarding politics that you have no place even discussing them
technology,removed,you ignore so many points that your own conclusions evaporate from a lack of substance i could respond to each but at this point youve shown a desire only to obfuscate the discussion either motivated by shilling or stupidity i will discontinue this discussion
technology,removed,please

technology,removed,taxis will be selfdriven due to better scheduling technology they will become cheaper and more prevalent rendering privately owned vehicles unnecessary for a large group of people todays taxis will disappear with the appearance of public or shared ownership of pools of selfdriven cars public transit will also be less needed as individuals will be sharing these car pools so only rail transports and express buses on very busy routes will be useful the rest will be serviced by cars and small vans that pick you up and drop you off at the door also your mechanical pet will never need to poop
technology,removed,not entirely people who are well off or persnickety about where they sit will still own their own vehicle instead of sharing them with the great unwashed others may join small groups or clubs that maintain and clean their fleet to exacting standards there will always be room for those who think of themselves as the higher class but most will just use whatever selfdriven cab comes at the door and turn it away or report it to the appropriate maintenance service if it is disgusting
technology,removed,i can imagine a few roads where only selfdriven cars are allowed or it could begin with a few lanes on wide roads like carpool lanes progressively more lanes and more roads will forbid meatdriven vehicles until they are eventually forbidden everywhere except by special exemption specialty or emergency vehicles law enforcement types
technology,removed,no they will make it then abandon it and make another version with a few features removed and then create an even newer version with only people who monitor customer complaints

technology,removed,i have a solution write them down i do but they were my prior changed passwords and i was traveling in the time i reset them this post is dumb you have no insight beyond your bubble you stay within
technology,removed,i understand but there is something fucked up when you go through all these hoops and you still dont have access to your account i used a password manager and thats how i got in the trap of forgetting my passwords after they were reset about times i have accounts its very difficult there is truly no point bitching about it though when everyone on here is blowing google so hard they cant hear anything else but their own gag reflex
technology,removed,all my passwords have meaning the problem is when you have to change them over and over again and you forget what the nuanced changed it was that you made

technology,removed,just shoot the cop hes not on your side so youre just getting him out of your way try to be hard to track too maybe on top of a building with a rifle fuck the cops all they do is try to pin a felony on you
technology,removed,why would you want something like that taken down people need to see firsthand what islam is like
technology,removed,yes because he personally removed them jesus christ on a cracker you are dumb
technology,removed,pakis are very sensitive about nudity and are used to violencedeath too
technology,removed,for profit prison eh what about no shudders
technology,removed,in fact forget the lawyer he will just talk to the police
technology,removed,reddit gets paid by companies to promote content they sucker people into buying gold as if they cant keep food on the table without the little guy donating they are just maximizing revenue from all angles
technology,removed,bullshitthey surveyed users of goodblock a pseudo ad blocker plugin that claims to donate charity in exchange for the ads it shows you this sort of plugin will naturally attract a sort of person that for some reason or another feels that watching ads in exchange for purported charity is better than just not seeing any ads of these cupcakes folks are whom the article discussesnot of all people that block ads also this article seems like an an advertisement for goodblock
technology,removed,every time i mentioned that ads turn me off of a product or brand more than help i am told that ads work on me even if i dont know it and i am arrogant for thinking i am immune to this universal truth you can always tell who makes a living from ads by the replies when this topic comes up
technology,removed,the entire reason they dont want to let you use your own modem is because the modems they give you are backdoored so they can spy on you and monitor what youre looking at constantly regardless of proxy server you might use they also want to be able to throttle you easier by throttling at the modem instead of at the isp side since id guess thats slightly harder to do when you can reroute their reroute better by using a third party dns
technology,removed,i work at a computer repair shop i feel guilty about installing adblock into every computer that leaves the shop sometimes because thats hundreds of machines a year that block ads because of me i feel a lot less guilty when times out of the computers come in because of those warning your computer is infected call this number ads that lock little old ladies into their browsers until they call the number and get taken for a few hundred dollars
technology,removed,you dont realize the volume of javascript loaded on each page no one would be able to go through all your data to figure it out its like figuring out which cell in your lungs first caught the cold
technology,removed,nope
technology,removed,i dont understand him he is sucking putins dick too hard
technology,removed,then its a failed business model
technology,removed,thats just wrong though when you hunt birds with a group one of the most effective ways is to use a line of people walking in unison a set distance apart varies depending on how many in the group what kind of coverterrain you are trekking through and what you are hunting the idea here is the wider stance of the line will allow the group to scare up a larger area of ground in far less time compared to walking in a cluster its like using a snow shovel vs a garden trowel the basic rules are simple stay in the line and only shoot ahead of the line the guy who got shot was breaking the most important rule its most important because if you break the line you are literally standing directly in the line of fire and as soon as any kind of brush gets between you and one of the group they cant see you but the bullets can hit you its all on the guy who got shot he should have followed the rules and if he was unable to do that then he shouldnt have been hunting either way im quite sure chaney said about a million im sorrys that day and the guy eventually apologized to chaney for putting him in that position it was the guys fault of course he said sorry he created a situation that allowed the media and the left to turn it into a hit piece to attack chaney he probably felt like a real asshole
technology,removed,get ublock
technology,removed,i dont mind ads but when i have to wait minutes for a site to load because of the stupid ads then im done i also hate when it appears like a site has loaded and i can click a link and when i go to click one more ad pops up that completely changes the layout and now ive clicked on either the ad or something i didnt want of the time when a site with ads pisses me off i just dont go to that site again there are a few sites though that i do feel the need to visit and if the ads are in the way im firing up the blocker sites that load fast and dont cause me to pull may hair out im fine with ads i have even found some to be useful clicked on them and bought stuff from them key word here is fast and dont block me from getting what i need from the site
technology,removed,lol bullshit
technology,removed,im most other cases sure that makes perfect sense its just simply not true in this specific scenario youre just wrong and no amount of overstating the obvious will make this logical exception any less valid

technology,removed,great response people are so entitled
technology,removed,put me in the sick of the trashy types of ads that i see on some sites no i dont want a mail order chinese bride thanks or tips on avoid this one exercise or the particular ones prompting me to buy life insurance showing a grieving family standing around a coffin in a grave if surfing the web means i have to put up with viewing that kind of shit im just going to make sure i see the entire web adfree
technology,removed,so theyre going to steal data from jews and profit from it then
technology,removed,supply demand and monopoly there is significant desperate demand since it will save your life and a monopoly on the supply so they can raise prices sky high because unrestricted free market capitalism is free to screw you its interesting to see something similar happening often in job markets if theres too many welders the competition drives the cost of hiring of welders down because theyll just hire in someone to work for less it doesnt matter that they produce million in products the company sells a year it is for you welder joe or well hire in the next guy note just examples idk what sellers earn offhand
technology,removed,apparently the shill is strong with this thread

technology,removed,when you get that money lets do business youll need to wire it to me and ill sort it out and make you richer spend money to make money
technology,removed,nat is irrelevant if its a single family home
technology,removed,except that many ips are tied to individual homes
technology,removed,if the ip was assigned to a single residence then it should be sufficient for a search warrant listing the premises but not sufficient for an arrest warrant of any particular individual effs chief claim is that isps are accidentally giving leo incorrect ips on a pretty frequent basis likely because they get the lease information wrong and further that ip spoofing is possible frankly i disagree assuming a particular isp doesnt have a history of fucking up its logs or misreading them then ip spoofing is not a reasonable as its pretty tricky and pretty uncommon reason to deny a search warrant and arrest warrant though that would be ridiculous of course
technology,removed,nor does a search warrant a search warrant is just for an address
technology,removed,dont make the assumption the eff knows better because while they might they certainly like to twist facts and sometimes blatantly lie in order to drive their donations just read their articles on net neutrality to view an example
technology,removed,careful i was just following orders hasnt gone down well as a good defence historically
technology,removed,the instance of that is low enough that a search warrant is still reasonable its just a search warrant not a conviction the burden of proof does not need to be beyond a reasonable doubt
technology,removed,what a search warrant is in relation to a particular crime so the evidence that would be confiscated would be particular to whatever is written in the warrant it may or may not include the computer and where on earth does the govt issue computers
technology,removed,for even minor things the police are sending in swat teams what wtf are you talking about
technology,removed,hey boss the eff sai
technology,removed,they could have entered any unit by force within the ip sharing area with this excuse wait ip address are shared within an apartment like when i google what is my ip i thought that was unique to me am i wrong
technology,removed,i dont understand what this has to do with anything if leo executes a search warrant that includes computer equipment then why does it matter who owns the equipment
technology,removed,ip sharing then seems to be a rather weak defense like if i pay for a connection then i shouldnt i be responsible for anyone who uses it
technology,removed,file a complaint with the reddit civility board
technology,removed,fair enough i just feel like yes its my ip but it wasnt my computer is a really weak excuse at best but then again its an excuse i would use as well if put under the spotlight lol
technology,removed,thats not how it works evidence seized in connection with a crime cannot be unseized by another branch of government
technology,removed,well then maybe you shouldnt have committed a crime with the computer
technology,removed,does that mean you should be guilty of childporn charges nope but it does mean that since the crime occurred on my gear i should be open to investigation like if a crime happens in my apartment i feel like it would be reasonable for police to investigate me and ask questions
technology,removed,i like the way you think boy sorry i also really like django theres already a rudimentary ai lawyer thats been hired by this httpfuturismcomartificiallyintelligentlawyerrosshiredfirstofficiallawfirm i think ai lawyers are the way to eliminate a lot of the sleaze from the legal profession then again i am a believer that ai will be ultimately beneficial theres a number of people smarter then me who disagree but im optimistic with the application potential of ai i think when we get to more subjective areas like politics ai involvement is only really desirable if you have something like one of httpsenwikipediaorgwikitheculture httpsenwikipediaorgwikimindtheculture back to law so the law is when practiced to its highest ethical aspirations a matter of logic my biggest beef with lawyers is their willingness to try and advanced flawed logic so as to get their outcome admittedly this is a small percentage of lawyers but they are the bad actors that gives the profession its shitty reputation with ai lawyers that becomes less of a concern for an ai lawyer to practice effectively its logic would have to work properly and any attempts to teach it to cheat would be quickly spotted and countered in detail by an ai opponent at lest thats how i would envision the process i still think you would need a human judge presiding because one of the whole points of our modern adversarial judicial system is to still leave human discretion as a part albeit a limited and defined one of the process you still need the ability for a judgejury to be able to return a counter intuitive decision as a way to protest injustice for those times when the law hasnt caught up yet with changing societal attitudesnorms however the lawyers on both sides job is really just to present the facts of the case to the best of their ability and to the best of the clients interest those are ultimately pure logicalanalytical roles and i think they could be fulfilled very well by ai even the primitive form we have as an ancillary benefit this would probably speed up the legal process and would also mostly eliminate bullshit tactics like data dumping where your discovery request is met with literal tons of paper that the provider hopes will distract you from the relevant details i work with software that is capable of processing tens hundreds of millions of messages a day depending on the hardware you allocate it ai would sort through data dumps with relative ease sorry for the long post this is a subject i never get tired of conversing about
technology,removed,there comes a point when its like mosquitoes buzzing around and biting you though ignoring them isnt entirely possible and it reduces your quality of life i dont know what the solution is but i cant believe that the only option is to just let people run around and smear their poo all over the walls at the restaurant while you ignore them and try to enjoy your meal there are consequences for such behavior in the real world so its not common we need a solution for the internet that doesnt punish innocents or expose people who really need anonymity like activists
technology,removed,you and ushiftmms are both wrong its part of their strategy of vendor lock in basically they want you to buy some airbuds
technology,removed,sure every forum or online community should have a native blockignore feature in my view but i dont know how to address things beyond comments having to use real names that are confirmed would change the landscape since there would be real life consequence to behaviorbut requiring that would keep people from expressing things like political opinions for fear of their boss seeing it and firing them etcor even worse in oppressive nations being jailed or killed i really dont know what the solution iswithout some social pressure to behave the shitty people take over and ruin thingsbut how do you apply that pressure anonymously
technology,removed,dont you hate it when youre trying to clean your butthole but accidentally air dry your wee wee instead
technology,removed,people are selfish drivers its the same reason they do the shit youve mentioned dont indicate dont follow signs push into queues you always get that one asshole who rushes up the wrong lane to pull in at the top its so frustrating but there will always be selfish drivers because there are always gonna be selfcentered dipsticks

technology,removed,thank you
technology,removed,its worth the effort for thousands in revenue the roi is insane to quote ulimbodog above i too am much more interested in fake news
technology,removed,google adsense now restricts websites which misrepresent misstate or conceal information about the publisher the publishers content or the primary purpose from participating in the program if you can find an advertising platform which allows fake news there shouldnt be any issues though
technology,removed,according to sony stratton was reported to psn multiple times for sending spam messages asking about interest in child pornography after reviewing the account in response to these complaints sony found that several images containing child porn had been downloaded by and uploaded to the account he sounds rather stupid
technology,removed,lets team up lol im not sure which ad platforms are more open to fake news though
technology,removed,oh wait were supposed to be making fake news uh but in all seriousness this is an issue that shouldnt solved by limiting the free speech rights of publishers but rather by educating people and developing critical thinking skills people need to evaluate sources themselves instead of believing everything theyre told
technology,removed,if youre crying about this and you didnt vote for hillary eat shit

technology,removed,emotions get in the way of course but if a couple can overcome that it is a far far far more cost effective alternative its important to note that some couple choose to invite parties into the bedroom purely for fun
technology,removed,not without being a tool it isnt
technology,removed,they can order an adult man to take the test but they cannot force the mother to force the child to take the test
technology,removed,they still have a pretty strong corporate email system i honestly miss the physical keyboards i know its not popular among the young but for work its amazing you literally cannot type as fast on a touch screen as you can on a blackberry keyboard
technology,removed,just doing their job doesnt work for nazis either all three groups belong in jail the felonious judge the perjuring pigs and the felons who execute the warrant if the warrant is false they are liable or would be if this countries judicial system wasnt corrupt to its core i understand you want to believe you live in a just society so you will try and convince me its just or insult me when you cant but thats you being unable to accept the enormity of the corruption im sympathetic its difficult for everyone
technology,removed,ive heard rumors they are looking to android os ideally id love to see an android based device with a physical keyboard probably not a popular opinion but for those whove sent long emails on a blackberry you know what im talking about much faster than a touch screen
technology,removed,blackberry keyboards are amazing for typing worklength emails far far better than touch screens

technology,removed,found the corporate shill
technology,removed,i had heard it from someone at work before i made this comment i googled fire and saw some articles those are my sources
technology,removed,too late fuck you
technology,removed,already got that answer from someone else i never had the occulus stuff to begin with and disabler didnt do much fortunately i think it settled down by its self fingers crossed that it lasts now for some reason whenever i open an app that uses the internet i get no connection errors until i open it a few more times i miss my
technology,removed,no he didnt reading comprehension
technology,removed,except apple is not a leader in market share and has dropped as of late even with this bad pr for samsung
technology,removed,it still is apple is still dwarfed by microsoft in terms of market share
technology,removed,your iq really isnt that high is it i mean we can go both ways with this and youd still be wrong as in what if you were a tesla shill and what if you were an actual tesla employee so tesla wouldnt give their best employees teslas to drive at least as company cars really unreal
technology,removed,samsung wins on both accounts even with this fiasco marketshare is a tangible reflection of this imaginary mindshare as marketshare reflects what people are willing to put money down for premkum marketshare is yet another attempt ay shaping data to show something other tban the reality that sansung dominates apple in cellphone arena
technology,removed,you have got to be shitting me i removed this initially cos one of your guys was annoyed at my title it wasnt spam then it isnt spam now getting reaaaaal tired of this
technology,removed,a large percentage of the materials found in his house and car contained highly classified information the official said investigators suspected that mr martin might have taken the material before mr snowdens actions became public he didnt off site three years after snowden and no scrub of his house or car what sort of sorry ass amateurs are they hiring over there
technology,removed,a perfect example of whats plaguing half my libraries is toastrjs i install with bower and i manually link to the js file in my layout pages html because all i want is for it to work at this point ive given up on fancy things when i put custom code a few lines below that link tag which uses toastr i get toastr is undefined if i go into the console and try and use it after the page is loaded i cant find it but i can see the actual code for it loaded in the website resources in the chrome dev tools somehow its including a library in the page and never defining it and that isnt even an issue of the package being poorly written because jquery data tables behaves the same way along with googles wavesjs
technology,removed,nice looks like i know what im doing today
technology,removed,we used to have something similar with truecar but they basically soldout to the dealers and no longer offer good deals
technology,removed,i personally would love it if we had a set price that was fair for both dealer and customer its call carmax
technology,removed,people here are pretty ignorant of the dealership model that america has and have no idea how many jobs and towns will be destroyed by direct sales yesdirect sales is a great way to go however there are entire towns that exist purely off the jobs and economy created by a lane of car dealerships
technology,removed,i actually love it to be honest at least client side but ive never dealt with this many libraries being thrown in all willy nilly like the people im working with have never worked in the madness of the javascript ecosystem and have been adding packages like madmen without planning any sort of build process theyre used to c where everything is ordered and just works now im trying to pick up the pieces but even im a little behind on all the crazy stuff theyre doing with javascript now id love to just bundle it all together minify it and load the bundle before my site script but it seems that those days are gone already
technology,removed,if you truly believe that true car is being payed to help raise prices then you need a tinfoil hat nice strawman but no thats not what i believe its rarely as clearcut as that anyway when they first started truecar used car sales data to disrupt the car sales business now they collaborate with the dealers they have pivoted and now spend more energy trying to keep dealers happy rather than disrupting there are numerous articles about it if you care to learn
technology,removed,and its very difficult to detect
technology,removed,usually some trust in the servers is required otherwise if an adversary was in control they can do all sorts of nefarious things maybe facilitate mitm more easily by swapping out the public keys signals public key verification mechanism is practically worthless you have to install an external barcode scanner a mate and i who both work on crypto software couldnt figure out how to get it to verify properly even after installing the scanner it was retarded an adversary with server control could also block messages from being sentreceived if they are stored on the server or if the server facilitates contact ip address lookup or block push notifications etc or other annoying things so that the chat participants would be forced to use an insecure chat app instead
technology,removed,energy to do what though
technology,removed,yeah im a bout half way through getting a test up and running unfortunately all our packages are through bower and browserifybower is freaking out now sigh
technology,removed,except thats not at all what i wrote its you making up a straw man so theres that again there are numerous articles about it if you care to learn
technology,removed,its all good thanks anyway its been good to have someone to bounce ideas off of
technology,removed,it was more of a yeah take it down than an i order you to take it down but i understand that tone is hard to communicate and identity online that said you say youre not sure so perhaps a command is the best way to get you to act i order you to remove the op

technology,removed,ah yes as usual its someone elses fault your kid is stupid how dare they allow this to happen to a child you should be fucking supervising you nonces
technology,removed,i now have a new analogy for making fun of tech companies with retarded behavior and it really hits the spot thanks
technology,removed,lol no i wouldnt take on a responsibility i cant handle and then burden everyone around me with what i should be doing youre right i dont have kids dont want them dont want to listen to yours either fuck off
technology,removed,its run by all women what do you expect
technology,removed,they stop a lot of terrorists you just dont hear about it on the news because they fail most of the time fixed
technology,removed,at this point is it really law enforcement
technology,removed,rip yahoo
technology,removed,you maybe could might be a terrorist or a lollipop sales judging from how unpredictable our algorithms are and how inept weve been so far in predicting actual terrorist attacks perhaps because more terrorist attacks increases our funding every time
technology,removed,i want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services we have also never allowed access to our servers and we never will sounds awfully specific i never stole that purple cookie jar on the left side of your bed after your dog disappeared on januray
technology,removed,thank you
technology,removed,what you mean to say is that you dont understand how its relevant i explained it to you in the previous comment so i guess youre beyond reason not uncommon for someone who masturbates with the amendment
technology,removed,in the i saw programs on tv when the discovery channel and the learning channel etc were actually still about quality topics that mentioned govt were working on stuff for deployment the drones that make decisions for themselves likely have already been designed if deployed that is scary to consider which is what many scifi plot lines are based on but its reality that it will probably someday be in use
technology,removed,can we just drone him no cuntary you cant
technology,removed,it was also from military educational sources thats what darpa and other departments work on stuff for the future

technology,removed,i was replying to ubreakslow when he claimed that people who own an android phone dont know that its an android phone thats quite very implausible some people dont care about their os but i assume that they at least know what name its called not even the dessert names for the versions just the word android itself
technology,removed,i bought a copy of windows a few years back to install and dual boot with linux i forgot about it and never got around to it then i saw the free windows upgrade for people with previous versions installed and thought how cool that was then people started complaining about windows behavior its an emotional roller coaster i just cant deal with anymore so i put the windows copy away and will ride it out
technology,removed,i threw unity on an old old laptop to look at it and while it looks nice it seems far too locked down even for a moderate user i could find no way for example to view properties of folders i right clicked on my home folder to look at the size information and nothing happened i cant find anywhere in the very limited settings to enable that or see it you cant even park a folder on the desktop temporarily
technology,removed,i tried osx once and one thing i loved about it was no constant restarts after updating i am not happy with the way they have soldered everything on and made their hardware unable to be upgraded affordably in the future so i am moving to linux full time but its not as smooth as osx and i have to fix more issues and put more time into the os which is annoying i have noticed in ubuntu i am required to restart after updates too which is annoying i dont recall osx ever requiring a restart after an update and had months long periods where i didnt turn off or restart a machine if i could have the osx experience on any hardware i want i would be happy but hackintoshing is unstable

technology,removed,i should clarify the project was specifically to look at malware injected into wordpress plugins not software binaries as part of my research into the incredible rise in infected wordpress sites and their role in spreading botnet infected drones it came about because i inherited a website from someone who had pirated plugins and noticed the malicious code while trying to make a customization my sample of plugins checked was relatively low around and i only rechecked them twice over six months most of the plugins used misspellings of jquerylike domains and they were easy to catch in the beginning by the end of the six months the code that started out as only lines was nearly lines in length i suspect that because i was reporting the malicious code to wordfence that they detected their detection and continued to obfuscate the code but the response from the kat team i still feel very strongly that anything that can be infected will be infected intentionally botnets are fucking profitable
technology,removed,im not going to share it because it has my real name on it and the kat folks are a vengeful bunch man
technology,removed,i was using wordfence which is specifically designed for wordpress virus detection
technology,removed,about ten thousand outsourced developers who are contracted on the cheap to build people websites it is the reason half the wordpress community is infected
technology,removed,no i used wordfence
technology,removed,ive seen malwarebytes give an exe a green light only to realize its malware months later after someone else reports it by then its too late for you
technology,removed,
technology,removed,whistleblower please you fucking moron
technology,removed,except that someone would google a sentence and find the online version which has my name nice try evil hacker
technology,removed,use ublock origin
technology,removed,generally the code was adding footers from a party website that contained arbitrary code the domain was often a misspelling of common domains youd see in websites typically it was very short but the obfuscated versions were impossible to read and much longer
technology,removed,thus ensuring the business model works for ransomware authors and guaranteeing ransomware is going to remain a threat for the foreseeable future i get why companies pay the ransom but in the grand scheme of things its going to hurt everyone
technology,removed,because in the article i dont mention kat intentionally
technology,removed,yeah and thats closer to how i actually feel but the truck drivers who have been busting my chops telling me how they won because trump is now the president elect are going to learn the hard way and i wont be shy about congratulating them on their victory
technology,removed,yes though there were examples of both remember that developer is going to be a victim as well

technology,removed,you rthedonald weirdos are like a broken record ctr ctr ctr ctr anytime anything isnt about pepe or slagging off hillary between that and prepending the name of everyone you hate with an elementary school insult your bag of tricks isnt very deep

technology,removed,it makes him much less of a moron than you get out of here troll
technology,removed,maybe you should take milos dick out of your mouth before you speak it makes you sound all garbled and incoherent
technology,removed,id suggest the safest thing is buy another camcorder that supports external microphones you might have some luck finding an electronics hobbyist or repair shop willing to modify the camcorder for you i really wouldnt suggest trying to do it yourself as you would need to cut out the existing mic with a saw damaging the housing
technology,removed,and by supporting hillary you are encouraging warmongering in the world state corruption on a level unseen before in the us and the triumph of personal greed for power over the common good
technology,removed,calling someone a shill for ctr has become the new boy who cried wolf for every one actual astroturfer on this site real users have been accused of being a shill this message has been brought to you by correct the recordtm
technology,removed,you are a blind rat oh fuck you hillary has broken the law to a point that any other american would be locked away and the key destroyed the fbi didnt think there was enough to pursue charges after a full investigation but dont let that influence your robust legal opinion
technology,removed,ya because rape threats at his gf are actually normal sop for the hillary shills you sound like you havent been aware of what is happening to his gf for her opinion no one deserves that and its funny how the left is more than willing to attack people like that pieces of shit the whole lot of u
technology,removed,rthedonald shitposts without the help or consent of this guy they tried to shill the nimble america pac there and mods stepped down due to the backlash this was one guy who gave money to a dumb idea that didnt pan out for literally anyone really this whole thing is people punishing someone for their political opinion when did we stop being an open democracy that its now ok to attack people who will vote differently than others fuck all of this noise
technology,removed,you mean tried to fund a shit posting campaign once the other mods on rthedonald caught wind of what purple tricycle was doing they shut that shit down immediately only hillary has to pay to get people to shill for her us centipedes do it for free
technology,removed,right trump supporters put on hoods and go beat people at night so you cant tell who they are
technology,removed,lol you are trying to rationalize your bullshit by pulling spaghetti bullshit its ok i also work with people that protect her they question the same thing that my relatives have too bad you probably dont have a career either the fact her family removed dozens of textile mills from my home decades ago to go to china is enough for me to dislike any of her foreign and domestic policies she profited from the gutting of american manufacturing but the only people that remember that are the year old grandmothers i know who worked for her family but keep up the stick ive voted dem for over years not anymore tho
technology,removed,subhuman trash i would say literally hitler but at least hitler had the decency to kill himself before he he gilded himself
technology,removed,trump trolls and hillary shills and sandfags its what america is comprised of now
technology,removed,so why do you trump people constantly complain about the mysterious ctr shilling every single anti trump thing or whatever
technology,removed,i see the shit ctr shills post on rpolitics ctr controls that sub including the mods how does shitposting compare to pissing on my leg and trying to convince me its raining
technology,removed,oh man you should see the folks that get away with the whole inciting violence thing nowadays blackamerica the new president of the black panthers and his association with politics and our current president are very interesting calls for the extermination of whites and tells chapter members and yells over a loud phone at community events to kill white babies just another side of the coin one that must dont want to or care to look at it seems
technology,removed,not to mention i notice none of these outraged devs are upset about hillarys troll campaign head by correct the record at the tune of million but i am glad these media outlets are clearly biased they are only feeding more people to the conservative movement
technology,removed,dredxadr and father ftdrxuzydddserx do rk fyi
technology,removed,of all the shitty things oculus has done this is not even remotely an issue in fact it was popular opinion amongst both rift and vive users to drop support for linux and osx steamvr doesnt support osx or linux either there is literally no oem mac on this earth that is considered vr ready due to their lack of powerful gpus even the mac pros dual amd firepro gpus are not vr ready the only macs that meet vr specs are a very small amount of hackintoshes or are using external gpus that number is unbelievably small compared to the million vr ready windows pcs the same is true for linux pcs linux is of the os market and only of linux pcs are vr ready putting in the effort to develop the oculus and steamvr sdk for osx and linux would be an incredible waste of time and money for both companies rant
technology,removed,nimble america is in this thread full force i hope you all get hit by a truck
technology,removed,are you a trump troll what palmer is doing is creepy financially supporting paid shills and trolls to derail online conversations and harass people and the guy youre talking about never said anything remotely resembling mccarthyism or anything you said he never suggested anyone deserved to lose their job or get harassed in any way whatsoever and certainly not for anything to do with political beliefs he only said but fuck that im selling mine and going vive this bit of news is just the latest in a long list of garbage nonsense coming from oculus and im done with them christ how the fuck did you get upvoted shill support
technology,removed,finally evidence of shills on reddit and look who is being shilled for
technology,removed,trump supporter who thinks that theyre the only ones who can call people who disagree with them shills who now feels like that is being threatened by the surge in awareness of a protrump shill organization
technology,removed,i hope you choke to death on trumps tiny cock
technology,removed,youre an idiot trump folks like you are just allergic to facts
technology,removed,ive yet to see a trump shill i have his names uonecommentonly and he posts on rthedonald all the time
technology,removed,yes the clintons have an entire federal agency in their pocket you have no idea how big of a lunatic you are
technology,removed,i have read those documents there is literally nothing in those documents that go as far as to prove that the fbi was in the pocket of the clintons youre a fucking conspiracy not is what the real issue here is your iq is literally too low for you to be at all reasonable which is why youre such a useful idiot for trump and his agenda
technology,removed,please do note how i have never attacked or insulted you notice too how i have remained calm while you have just lost your temper and got triggered now tell me please who has mental issues you are because youre seriously discussing this topic while im taking you for the laughing stock that you are
technology,removed,you havent even provided a single fact in your entire litany of idiocy thus far

technology,removed,so twitter launched in deleted that many accounts from to a few months ago and you think there isnt already another account to replace every one they deleted the fact you think that purge made a difference scares me
technology,removed,it is literally impossible with the freely availability of freedisposable email accounts vpns different machines different ips you cannot ban a physical person from using a website
technology,removed,httpssourceforgenetprojectssoxfilessox you can compress voice down to a little more than lets be generous and allow for double that bandwidth assuming that you spend about hours awake in your home each day that comes out to under per day if there is good encryption between the echo and amazon it seems reasonable they could hide into the payload anytime there is a legitimate use of the device if the voice recognition is done on the device then it could be much smaller httpwwwlipsumcom i generated a word block of text and it came out to so they could send the heavily compressed sound file if you are the kind of user that routinely uses echo in which case you could never notice those audio files or they could do voice recognition and send the last days worth of text files as soon as you do use the device it would still not be an unreasonable amount of hidden data

technology,removed,i dont feel like either person gave you a correct answer so here you go both republicans and democrats have a party stance but neither of them particularly adheres to it they simply have conflicting and sometimes not conflicting owners backing them up financially lively debate on things that dont matter people died in alone from heart disease but we better talk about gun control instead of our shitty food that we subsidize that is slowly killing everyone keeps the population distracted and fighting each other instead of focusing on getting rid of the corruption
technology,removed,this argument has been debunked several times if youre going to be a gun control zombie at least get some relevant material
technology,removed,how about single issue bills no riders allowed
technology,removed,you know every time you fail to get exactly what you want out of government it doesnt mean that the government has collapsed into an oligarchy we voted for these people and we continue to do so this is the will of the people if people cared they would vote for someone else
technology,removed,ok so life is a hopeless charade in which you dance to the tune of invisible masters the strings pulling you every which way in the hands of the cruel cruel puppetmasters that control and see everything there is no hope because any rational approach to affecting politics is futile and citizens will live forever as slaves of the invisible conspiracy that controls everything oh woe is me
technology,removed,maybe if nobody represents your interests then your interests arent very interesting if you really believe that it is impossible for anything to change then i guess go ahead and give up i dont give a shit le ebil gubmint conspiracy is a figment of your imagination if the public gave two shits about spending their lives online then the laws would change most people dont care so neither do lawmakers welcome to society
technology,removed,the third district doesnt even cover the locations near the capital most of the district is either inaround baltimore or around annapolis not dc maryland is not where the spy agencies are you seem a little confused about maryland are you sure you are from there the nsa has a massive facility in maryland a little bit outside of baltimore over people are employed by the nsa at this facility from their own information about the facility at least employees work for the nsa at fort meade making it the largest employer in the county one of the largest employers in maryland and the largest employer of mathematicians in the country a number of people from fort meade which is where this massive nsa facility is located are some of the largest political contributors in the and districts to say that it is just employees that wouldnt make a difference is so laughably absurd that i honestly cant believe you actually live in maryland

technology,removed,it is so stupid to believe that our choices are already picked for us by fucking who do you honestly fucking believe that millions upon millions of people are literally helpless and are being forced to vote for people they dont want by a shadowy cabal if even of the workforce decided not to show up for work one day politicians would shit their fucking pants and do absolutely anything we demanded politicians serve us but people are lazy pieces of shit who genuinely dont give a fuck what politicians do so politicians naturally pick options that profit them personally why shouldnt they from a cold calculating nonethical perspective they vote to cripple the internet and they get reelected they dont vote to cripple the internet and they get reelected their constituents go to the polls and officially proclaim great job more of the same please by voting the same people back into office so why not cash in while keeping their jobs too there is no secret conspiracy people just suck we are a bunch of snarling pack animals that are averse to change and stuck in a state of nature mentality about security its not going to get better any faster than extremely slowly humanity has and always will be like this try to deal with it in a less pessimistic way and change what you can instead of wailing about how helpless we are we arent helpless we just simply dont care
technology,removed,well so long as they both can agree on getting rid of the sixth amendment neo liberals cause more gun deaths than actual domestic terrorists when you figure they support the war on drugs which leads to gang warfare on black market same goes for neocons
technology,removed,httpwwwfeinsteinsenategovpublicindexcfmstateoffices
technology,removed,no friend im just bitter and angry about the political situation and constant manipulation of people most gun nuts just like guns or were in a situation where they needed one at some point we need to get to a place where we can have an honest conversation about introducing some whitelist style qualifications for people to have certain types of weaponsbut we will never get there while politicians are scaring the shit out of people and constantly referring to normal semiauto weapons as assault weapons
technology,removed,prohibiting civilian ownership of will not prevent mass shootings only ensure yet another even if small deterrent for corruption is removed from the everyman we have a gun culture in the us prohibiting civilian ownership will just ensure criminals and government have them and nobody else dont kid yourself this isnt australia or canada there is definitely fearmongering both ways but the ruling class has repeatedly shown they want to remove access to firearms so the whole obama is acomin fer my guns sentiment isnt really so crazy
technology,removed,debunked as in ive seen so many explanations including dc vs heller of why arguing that is only for organized militia that it isnt something i will entertain debates about we should do more in terms of requiring certain commonsense qualifications to own powerful firearms but removing access to them from qualified civilians is not the answer someone shared with me an entertaining video where a girly huffpo reporter guy was shocked and appalled that he could purchase an in florida in minutes even though he had no criminal record and no history of mental illnessthis actually does unintentionally highlight a big problemidiots who have no business being anywhere near firearms can buy them how about instead of just a background check you have to prove you can actually accurately fire such a weapon and that you know the lethal force laws in your home state the problem is we cant have this conversation because pathetic people incapable of critical thinking are swept up in the omg its an assault weapon propaganda nonsense and nobody who knows anything about guns can take such a person seriously
technology,removed,unless you can uninvent the gun youre not changing it in the way you likeif you want to move somewhere that that affluent and ruling class controls firearms why not leave the us instead of trying to ruin it plus the gun culture is actually a positive thing it shouldnt be changed on the whole but we should make some small changes to how we view what qualifies a person to have and carry certain firearms we can have a happy medium between no civilian ownership and means i have the right to an bruh i dont need to take no course
technology,removed,except youre talking about taking away freedoms not promoting them this isnt some christian gayrights debate where someone is trying to use euphemisms and religious freedoms to excuse hating a group of peoplethis is you and people like you trying to take individual freedoms away from a minority group people who purchase and own firearms legally and your justifications are not holding up if youre going to compare gun control to civil rights you are the one who is on the wrong side of it not me
technology,removed,my company just calls it a processing fee because we need to take the information over the phone if you dont want to put it in on the website if you do want to use the website our clients tell us to put in a credit card use fee we use a thirdparty processor that charges the fee our clients customers get angry for the fee we can give them the runaround between us the client and the thirdparty processor until they quit why yes i do work for some toptier assholes also no matter how good the customer service person is once you finally get ahold of them if you think a phone system is deliberately designed to get you to give up and go away youre probably right
technology,removed,youre an idiot i fucking hate modern kids that will continue to use a service while complaining endlessly about it i hope comcast doubles their rates tomorrow just to stick it to you even harder
technology,removed,your problem is you think prohibiting civilian ownership of firearms prevents violenceit doesnt in fact big murderous events typically happen in areas where guns are prohibitedi think there is a big temptation on the part of milk toast simpering type people to ignore this but it is very realjust do a little thought experimentif youre an asshole who plans on massacring people are you going to do it where they are more likely to shoot back
technology,removed,ban riders
technology,removed,not really
technology,removed,not really
technology,removed,i dont understand the question ive explained why prohibiting firearms is dumb ive also explained my position that more powerful weapons should require qualifications to acquire with the extremely important caveat that the qualifications must be attainable by the average person governments would be very tempted to price them out of reach as prohibition bystealth the information youre asking for is all there go forth and use your neurons

technology,removed,a lot more complicated than idiots on here are making it out to be taxi drivers announced a strike for a limited time i think hour with a pretty good statement about how a majority of the taxi drivers are immigrants and also muslim the union obviously wants to show support to their constituents uber probably had surge pricing due to higher demand got criticized rightfully removed it something everyone can see when they go to book an uber however they decided to announce how righteous they are by saying they turned off surge pricing unfortunately it was bad timing as it sounded more like an announcement that we are open for business while the taxi drivers go on their limited time strike made it feel like crossing a picket line in reality uber had no obligation to support the taxi drivers however in this case no supporting taxi drivers gets confused with not supporting the protest what made this entire thing worse for uber the statement from uber ceo was spineless unlike the netflix ceo it was just a pr disaster all the way around which can be seen clearly by the fact that lyft won the day on the pr front by doing two things being quiet and saying nothing capitalizing on ubers disaster by donating to aclu opportunistic but in an american way so there you have it pr is not easy but uber made it seem harder than it has to be im guessing a simple statement along the lines of surge pricing is off we are not taking advantage proved but we cannot ask our independent contractors to strike and force them to not earn a living it is out of our hands would have solved this fiasco the entire inconveniencing nonprotesters is garbage logic if you actually care about a cause but you can spin it to not be that if you have better pr people

technology,removed,it is ops post is a bit revisionist ubers ceos is one of trumps advisers thats what this was all about as we know trump only surrounds himself with people that dont question him or challenge it aside from that everything that was described in his post happened after people started deleting their accounts uber was in full damage control when it setup the legal fund and came out in support of their drivers meanwhile lyft without being under the gun happily donated to the aclu over the next years people want to criticize the deleteuber thing but it was about ubers ceo supporting trump and saying that they must work with him in order to further their missions maybe its true maybe it isnt but they dont have to announce it and make a big thing about it like theyve had elon musk tim cook all those guys work with trump but they are not going around sending out company wide emails about how their company must work with president trump to further their mission globally i deleted my uber account i dont care what people call me the only way i can send uber a message is with my wallet you support trump i dont support you simple as that ubers move of supporting trump was a dumb gamble they should have waited until after january or february to go all in on him since their customer base is largely in big cities and as its been discussed ad nauseam thats where us libtards who hate trump live

technology,removed,assange seems more interested in getting hillary for all the headaches she caused him than he does getting the truth out in general i am really disappointed in how he is using wikileaks for this personal agenda and giving trump such a gift like this when trump is just as big of a crooked piece of shit as hillary

technology,removed,interesting so do you know what the improvement in technology is that reduces helium usage so drastically is it some recycling system the article is woefully inadequate for these important details
technology,removed,for those wondering why this wasnt always the case think about why the us standard railroad gauge distance between the rails is feet inches thats an exceedingly odd number why was that gauge used because thats the way they built them in england and english expatriates built the us railroads why did the english build them like that because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the prerailroad tramways and thats the gauge they used why did they use that gauge then because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons which used that wheel spacing okay why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing well if they tried to use any other spacing the wagon wheels would break on some of the old long distance roads in england because thats the spacing of the wheel ruts so who built those old rutted roads imperial rome built the first long distance roads in europe and england for their legions the roads have been used ever since and the rut they the roads roman war chariots formed the initial ruts which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels since the chariots were made for imperial rome theywere all alike in the matter of wheel spacing the united states standard railroad gauge of feet inches is derived from the original specifications for an imperial roman war chariot and bureaucracies live forever so the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horses ass came up with it you may be exactly right because the imperial roman war chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two war horses

technology,removed,but the expense when you could easily have purchased a simple wetdry vacuum and built your own cyclone system to keep your filter all nice and clean for a significantly longer time its also a lot stronger as well so it will pick up more stuff if you have a problem with the sound you can always muffle it with aluminium sheet rolled up and egg carton foam put on the inside to bounce around the sound drastically you can also just use any other kinda tube as well but aluminum sheeting is my favorite since you can control the size

technology,removed,i dont expect i will get much sympathy give the audience here but i have seen a massive shift in how people communicate in the last years and i find it very frustrating its harder to contact someone now than it was before the internet not for lack of options but because now so many people ignoredelay responses i have people reply weeks or months later like its no big deal when i have asked people why they communicate so poorly its always some variation of i respond when i feel like itnobody has a right to demand my time i find this a very weird and extremely selfishdisrespectful attitude i am not saying you have to be at my beck and call but i dont think its unreasonable to callwrite someone back within hours in most cases waiting daysweeksmonths is just shitty
technology,removed,doxx people got it
technology,removed,why are they not allowed
technology,removed,is there any way of doing that without doxxing or do we get our comments shadow deleted for asking
technology,removed,how do we do that without breaking other reddit rules
technology,removed,they way so many people handle communication anymore is weird this idea that how dare someone try to initiate contact with me attitude is bizarre and always comes back to some odd idea that its rude or demanding to do sobut blowing people off and replying days later is perfectly acceptable in their minds

technology,removed,do you even hear yourself no i really dont care about any of this and no one else does unless theyre already trying to find reasons to be offended are not outraged by ssl certificates definitely not me who cares and if your best argument is but trump is worse you dont really have an argument im probably going to be voting party this election as will many others nope never said that supported clinton through whole primary good for you have fun with that

technology,removed,so theres clearly something wrong with your system
technology,removed,your simple aptget update and upgrade command somehow in there gets borked and then it wont let me install or update anything else sounds like you were fucking around with your repos and mixing different versions of libraries as a result dont do that
technology,removed,thats like saying the reports of samsungs note exploding are exaggerated yeah it sometimes explodes but its not as dire as everyones making it seem the point is it shouldnt explode at all and apple shouldnt randomly remove perfectly working features for no reason forcing people to buy dongles or create workarounds for things that used that feature with no problem before and then not even include that same structure in its other products so youre unable to connect them together this is just really basic fundamental stuff that theyre screwing up now
technology,removed,well yeah if i make a car where all the bolts are triangle shaped the speedometer is in microsoft units per hour and the gas tank is microsoft gallons no one is going to want to service it or use it get your head of your ass and start using the web standards that everyone else uses or else well all just classify the pitiful microsoft market share as acceptable losses and stop developing for your dumpster fire of a browser all together
technology,removed,ive used firefox as my main browser for around years and the handful of times its crashed ive had one or more sessions going for at least a week with hundreds of open tabs dozens of video tabs at least addons ui customizations other programs running low ram etc thats how i normally use a browser though and its very very rare that it will crash
technology,removed,theyre also a premium company this is the real reason youre paying for a name and all things being equal you necessarily have to get less in other areas compared to products that have to compete on quality alone thats why apples profit margins are so high same reason the top name brand in any product category profits are higher than competitors the competitors have to pour all their money into making their product better because by default people will go with what they know or what they see others using
technology,removed,go pro is wrong and you sound like a paid shill

technology,removed,forbes by itself is not a trustworthy source the article you linked was by a contributor with little to no credentials and simply chooses to correlate average income with racism lol okay ignore any information you cant rebut i guess forbes fucking magazine doesnt hold up to your elevated standards when they dont fit your narrative this is the first piece of evidence youve dismissed outright as for the ferguson reports it still means nothing i have said again and again that proving a single instance of racism doesnt prove that racism exists as a structured and institutionalized form lol okay ignore any information that you cant rebut this is the second source that youve dismissed outright whats happening in ferguson is simply a microcosm of whats happening in courts all across america hence the reason the us has the highest incarceration rate on earthbut ferguson is just an isolated thing right im sure all the courts in alabama mississippi texas louisiana s carolina etc are all racially blind right but in the end it is stuff that happened in the past it doesnt exist anymore lol okay ignore any information that you cant rebut jesus its like arguing with a toddler and i will ignore your bs anecdotes as anecdotes are bs you realize nothing happening today is happening in a vaccum the reason for the wealth disparities between blacks and whites which you refuse to acknowledge are the direct result of generations and generations of sustematic oppression but to call it a systematic race issue just fosters narrative of hatred between two groups that should be cooperating to tackle a larger and much more real issue the class divide in the us lol genius perhaps you dont realize it yourself but youre sprinkling your arguments with ad hominem attacks because deep down you realize that the arguments youre giving are weak hahaha how would you know you didnt read any of it the best you can produce are articles written by people on reddit and forbes with little to no credentials other than a large number of imaginary internet points lol i guess forbes and the doj have no credentials i only posted the reddit comment to give you a little history lesson everything he said can be checkednot that you care you have your narrative while i find the points you make to be ignorant i do not think any less of you as a person well i do think less of youyour willful blindness your inability to take me seriously your smug dismissal of insurmountable evidence is sick black people have been suffering from oppression in this country for centuries and because of people like you well probably be suffering for centuries to come i dont have the privilege of ignoring reality i have to deal with this everyday i remenber the first time i watched my father the smartest man ive ever known get put in handcuffs and sat in the mud because theres no way you can afford a car like this when i was years old and ive witnessed countless injustices against myself and my family ever since im a year old whos opting out of having children because i dont want to bring black kids into a society that hates and despises them i do think youre a bad person because youre choosing to ignore the struggles that we live with everyday and while youll go on about your day feeling smug and sure ill still have to deal with racism everyday probably for the rest of my life so fuck you please dont respond to me anymore

technology,removed,exactly what i said to myron on wed jun at pm myron ebell mebellceiorg wrote dear david fred has laid out the big picture and we can talk more about that if you want to im rushed today so let me just make two small points to think about warmer temperatures mean less severe extreme weather events such as storms the historical evidence shows this very strongly and the reasons are well understood for an historical overview i suggest the little ice age by the archeologist brian fagan the ipcc chapter on extreme weather events shows no recent trend toward more frequent or more severe extreme weather events which makes sense because the global temperature trend has been flat if there is warming then the trend line will go down second the arctic has been in a cycle of warming while the antarctic as shown by the british antarctic survey weather stations has been in a period of cooling are higher levels producing warming at one pole and cooling at the other these are multidecadal ocean cycles the alaska side of the arctic has in the past few years entered the cool phase of the pacific cycle with record snowfalls and cold the last couple years while the cooler north pacific waters have caused much smaller salmon runs in alaska and enormous runs in british columbia and oregon while a government commission still studies what is causing the small salmon runs in bc nome had to be relieved by an icebreaker this fall so an oil tanker could get through the much earlier than usual ice shell is delaying its drilling by two weeks in the beaufort sea because theres much more ice than usual this spring these things come and go when the atlantic oscillation flips greenland will cool down yours myron myron ebell director of freedom action and director center for energy and environment competitive enterprise institute from david zetland dzetlandgmailcom date thu jun at pm subject re global warming and cei to myron ebell mebellceiorg hi myron thanks for all the information i am not going to get into the science debates except to point out that any scientist who could show the huge majority of his fellows to be wrong would not only get massive attention and funding but endless apologies etc thats how the scientific method works of course we saw it recently with the debunking of the autismvaccine claim i see zero sign of such debunking by agcc deniers theres no world conspiracy of scientists aimed at securing funding theres not even a cabal of ideologues who want everyone to wear a hair shirt so how about we make a gentlemans bet that agcc is happening we can close in some time in the next years i reckon until then lets work on the low hanging fruit we have been one of the leaders in opposing policies that raise energy prices reduce access to energy and force people to use less energy we have been active for decades opposing federal flood insurance and similar policies that subsidize building in flood plains and on beaches we have always opposed the farm bill and have spent quite a lot of effort trying to get rid of environmentally destructive subsidies such as the sugar program and the ethanol mandate do you support pigouvian taxes aimed at local pollution resulting from energy burning coal for example

technology,removed,humans are creative yes but machines will be able to fake creativity pretty soon i bet if you fed the top songs per year into a smart enough ai in chronological order it would spit out something that could be a hit next year is that creativity what if it autogenerates all of the music to include the humansounding voices were not there yet but what if it can also autogenerate the music video that goes along with it in photorealistic quality that is probably impossible right now but i doubt that will stay impossible for another years you could probably have a computer write the song now and have humans perform it
technology,removed,the fact that the songs were different as time goes on is my point though if you just feed it current pop songs i think you could get an ai that makes you a likable current pop song that doesnt seem very creative everyone will just say thats not real creativity thats just following a formula the point of feeding it all the popular songs and in the order they were popular is so that it can figure out what it thinks will be popular in the future it will be coming up with music not currently like the popular songs of today but it thinks will be popular tomorrow it would be hard to distinguish that from creativity its making something creative that it thinks we will like thats new and not supposed to just sound like whats out there now

technology,removed,theyll probably payout very very rarely developers will find the bugs but apple will close them as theyre not bugs then the bug will be mysteriously fixed by an anonymous dev since apple doesnt who the anonymous dev is they dont have to pay out this is a well known tactic that has been employed by several tech companies why should be apple be any different

technology,removed,yea but i would invest in eth maybe a smaller amount of monero as well eth is where its at and was the original vision for a crypto based decentralized currency in the early days of the internet bitcoin is like a decentralized expensive database ethereum is like a decentralized expensive computer but since its a computer it can offer the ability to have decentralized databases not actually residing on its blockchain like bitcoin and offer the same security for much cheaper with a limitless amount of other possibilities

technology,removed,why should the same rules apply european countries have dozens of competing networks and a huge chunk of them are in a cartel threatening to not improve their network to unless the eu lessens net neutrality regulation there is more competition in the eu than in the usa but dont fool yourself into thinking there is plenty of competition or choice thats total bullshit its thanks to net neutrality that for example kpn can no longer ask extra money for unrestricted whatsapp access this factually happened and with many more services are you a libertarian by any chance or do you work for an isp no sane consumer would be against net neutrality
technology,removed,so
technology,removed,i think det lester fremon said it best you follow drugs you get drug addicts and drug dealers but you start to follow the money and you dont know where the fuck its gonna take you in this case you follow eggs you get the poachers but you start to follow the eggs and you dont know where the fuck its gonna take you
technology,removed,yeah because all poachers have this simple equipment it would never be a poor villager who probably got paid to pick them up or just a poor poacher who doesnt have access to the internet and may not know any better

technology,removed,you misunderstand me im talking specifically about redditors or the internet generation youtube commenters etc here not all americans the type of people who use the word cuck all the time etc to say trump is popular simply because some americans point to certain things in the eu like health care etc as something the us should go for would be fuckin crazy man

technology,removed,elite as in talent value to society drive and motivation creativity innovation kindness and generosity i also think a society should not blame itself for doing well we send massive amounts of aid to africa china is starting to trade with africa and that will be very good for all involved their economy will develop eventually
technology,removed,youd think so try telling that to a capitalist
technology,removed,oh no nobody wants to read our propaganda they prefer the other sides propaganda
technology,removed,yup out of the thousands of people ive known over the years i think or were actual truckers
technology,removed,the greed of the elite is already starting to cause an exponential explosion of automation and a gigantic job crisis will be felt within years guaranteed that doesnt even make sense you want to argue greed which implies lower payrolls and in the same breath you want to argue that lowering payroll costs via greed is causing exponential explosion of automation and a gigantic job crisis you need to think more critically about cause and effect

technology,removed,i wonder if the concern of how to support your familys basic needs goes away im not convinced it would ever work long term on a national scale or that it would even be enough to pay rent and cover calories a day think of the way college tuition hikes are right in line with federalstate student aid increases its just another form of chasing the dragon if such a program were to ever come into being though instead of cash like ssi or food cards like access just flat out give calories soylent pouches and shelter shipping container homes the whole selling point of the program is to keep people from slipping through the cracks as an example plenty of old people living on ssi cant keep up with the rentutilities or avoid the casinos i doubt ill see any of the above programs in my lifetime despite it being compulsory for me to pay into them so its just a thought

technology,removed,who was so stupid they thought nintendo had anything to do with the game what fucking nintendo logos do you see on the app none
technology,removed,this isnt entirely wrong and yeah if youre looking to set money aside for the long run absolutely go with a nonmanaged index fund but its worth noting a considerable part of the reason this happens is the cost of trading and the fees you pay the people managing your money investors and fund managers themselves can beat the market although certainly not all of them its extreme but look at people like warren buffet his company has absolutely killed the market for about years straight now

technology,removed,people are giving you options for privacy and your answer is its too hard and doesnt matter anyway fuck off if you use these tools properly you can keep your messages and data private with very little effort its a simple right click and encrypt to use gpg on most systems once you install it but you dont want to bother installing and making keys because it intimidates you and that pisses you off
technology,removed,anyway they could remotely hack the voting machines or are they air gaped
technology,removed,i understand the frustration because foss stuff usually does have a bad ux and often nerdily complicated documentationbut its not impossible and if you give up before trying you will never learn veracrypt looks very intimidating at first and the ux is shitbut its really pretty simple once you mess with it and create some practice containers most people want click once to install and click once to use i get that as i want that toobut being a dick to people who are saying hey i know this isnt as simple as pressing and icon but it does work is shitty
technology,removed,so they didnt remove anything
technology,removed,i guess i dont believe anyone doesnt really care i think its more i dont know how to deal with this i understand that because i have those feelings often when you distill the arguments down and ask people for physical access to their private medical records bank accounts deepest secrets they recoil and say no way but those things and more are online so they do carethey just feel helpless so try not to think about it or lash out at how hard it is to address
technology,removed,👌
technology,removed,completely untrue that the nsa is going to break into your gpg encrypted messages unless you have done something very stupid like shared your private key or they have targeted your device and installed keyloggers etc to get your passwords nothing can protect you from that but they arent breaking the gpg encryption
technology,removed,you should never use pgp you are at odds with top crypto and security experts i will go with them
technology,removed,i simply do not believe that if they say so its because they dont understand the consequences but when they did understand them or suffered them they would certainly care ignorance doesnt mean you dont careit means you dont understand
technology,removed,thats still not forward secret because a compromised pgp key means all messages can be read that just makes your anonymity greater i am not at all an expert and have spend the last reading about this and there seems to be no way to have forward secrecy with email at this time because of the offline nature of it
technology,removed,if you are going to make expert declarations as fact then you do need to prove your qualifications your ego isnt relevant hereyour actual knowledge is nobody said anyone should use pgp for chattingbut its the best we have for email that i know of you said you shouldnt be using it at all now you say its not suitable for otr chats which it isnt used for anywayso what exactly is your point
technology,removed,you kind of have to when someone starts arguing the definition of something
technology,removed,is the fact that all of the higherups at the dnc being tech retarded considered a vulnerability
technology,removed,upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote upvote
technology,removed,i am not going to go quote by quote when half of them are strawmen you are trying to salvage what you said now by moving the goalposts such a frustrating part of talking to people online
technology,removed,hrmm this is a poser let me see who runs facebook zuckerberg ah well im sure thats purely a coincidence

technology,removed,of course
technology,removed,its free
technology,removed,reset
technology,removed,you just compared two products that arent even in the same space you also are repeating the obvious people like easier notion no shit people would love to never have to refuel their cars as well but we do have to we have to park get out unscrew the cap swipe the card stand in the hot or cold if you want the car to be able to go this is what you have to do if thats too hard you dont go saying well since they make you have to get out and do something the product is bad is silly if you want privacy there are tools to do it and any normal person can learn them if you choose to say those tools are too much effort that is your optionbut you cant say its not possible or usable you just chose not to bother
technology,removed,another one of those reason is that you dont have friends
technology,removed,i never said it people shouldnt try to make it easier i have never seen anyone say that and it is getting easier and people who do understand it are working on it and improving it how is telling people that something isnt as hard as they imagine selfish and arrogant i am not brilliant and i learned how to use gpg and yes the average person can also
technology,removed,that doesnt even make sense there isnt an alternative to secure except insecure if people cant be bothered that is on them and nobody else the tools develop and get easy to use users have to choose how much effort they are willing to put in to protecting their data if whatsapp is acceptable for you and covers all of your use cases then greatif not then you have some work to do but saying too hard not worth it is a choice not an insurmountable barrier
technology,removed,i really dont understand the point of comments like this that say obvious things over and over no kidding we all want things to be easier ideally a lot of things would be different about life this is the reality we are faced with and you can choose to engage that reality or cover your face and ignore it nothing you have said changes the fact that the average person can learn to use the tools we have right now they choose not to
technology,removed,give up then its all pointless anyway since we will die someday there you go
technology,removed,i am discussing the same thing i have in every comment that this stuff is possible to learn if people will try and not go into it with a bad attitude you are saying if things are easier more people will use themthat doesnt even need to be saidits obviousand has been said over and over and over that simple fact about life doesnt change the fact that tools exist that people can learn to encrypt their messages and data its not arrogant or elitist or unreasonable to say they can do this they choose not toand thats their choice but the excuse of its too hard so i cant doesnt fly
technology,removed,my point is it shouldnt be necessary to learn anything i dont know how people like you get through life with this attitude i would love a utopia too its never going to happen you can learn and make it happenor you can bitch its not magically happening your and their choice
technology,removed,yes meddling electionsunder minding is exactly that russia cant do it but we can bomb the fuck out of countries and spread democracy real american you must be
technology,removed,lol you are embarrassing yourself kid your a tool if you think im a shill ive been antiestablishment since the bush days my years at reddit have been nothing but fuck the establishment so if raging against the political is considered being a shill paint me guilty i am the enemy lol now lemme get back to watching this ufc and smoking my legal weed
technology,removed,a users vote count only appears after you up or downvote their comment for that exact reason
technology,removed,😂😂😂 extremely accurate you forgot a couple things make sure the car is programmed to make uturns on red the radio should be max volume at all times no option to turn it down when turning onto a main road the car should either cut right in front of traffic or should stay at the stop sign until there are no cars coming for at least blocks no inbetween when parking the lines are where the tires should go not in the line on the line congratulations your self driving car is now prepared to drive in florida
technology,removed,thats probably true

technology,removed,she just touched his penis a little
technology,removed,i take it as a given these days that people on reddit have been wronged by hr in one way or another me im an advocate of the organisation and an advocate of the employee of the costs of running an organisation are on salaries id like to hope most of these people are gainfully and happily employed if youve slipped on some yoghurt whilst getting ready for work and now require compensation payment because it caused you to miss work well i struggle to sympathise and id dare anyone else to suggest frivolous claims are to always be beared and paid out this is when hr becomes the enemy and all that usual shite when actually all the little details most casual obervers arent privy to invalidate a complaint or a claim essentially leaving a disgruntled or bored employee if someone opened a grievance id meet them to speak then of course id go straight to the manager in order to interview them too i dont care who feels what i want the facts of the matter and then to recommend a way to get past it ill make a decision based on pure facts and several times ive sent away managers with their own feedback and recommendations to change their behaviour why would i want to employ a shitty manager im not some sort of organisational jingo the point im making is that theres always two sides to every coin and honestly it hurts when i see blanket condemnation of hr as a trade some of us actually have an interest in people and make an effort in a leadership role and with the level or authority youd have id be going mental at hr and putting a stop to the closed club culture that youre describing above wheres the objectivity and pragmatism if youre operating an old boys club it shifts the balance of power and creates a culture where all leadership are complicit in the behaviour toxic eh ill take the flack for this comment too i genuinely believe in my trade

technology,removed,held hostage thats a touch dramatic isnt it you have internet it might not be as fast as other countries but you can still do what you need to do many people in rural populations still do not have a reliable internet connection those people despite not making up the majority of the population contribute a lot to australia and should not be seen as secondrate citizens because they dont live in the city the nbn is not synonymous with fibre many of these areas especially in wa are actually being done through areas that already have copper which will eventually fail as it is an aging infrastructure are getting fiber not for the sake of speed but for the sake of reliability and extra capacity for the future as ive said before we have a unique set of conditions in australia that makes providing internet to everyone very difficult indeed so yes the internet here doesnt compare to other more densely populated countries and it probably never will at some point people are just going to have to accept that and cut the tiresome whinging about it you can still download faster than you can actually watch things why do you think that city people should have faster internet before the basic needs of the rest of the population have been met
technology,removed,aw did the poor piggy wiggy get his butt hurt
technology,removed,oink oink fucker its ridiculous that you get upset when someone points out that there are crooked police officers everywhere were not saying theyre all crooked but that there are crooked ones everywhere

technology,removed,im one of those many who changed my internet use i took down my facebook profile several years stopped posting on it years ago mainly because i dont trust facebooks privacy settings ive deleted many personal emails rather than keep them in perpetual storage online im more concerned about identity thieves and fraud than i am about the government i rarely email anything that is confidential ill call or talk in person instead im careful not to email comments that i wouldnt want forwarded to a family member coworker or friend i used to keep a complete uptodate backup in the cloud of everything on my hard drive i quit that years ago due to privacy concerns i do keep some encrypted zip files in the cloud of some files that i would really miss if my computer and onsite backups were ruined such as original writings music ive composed i store photos online too but not many documents i make many posts on reddit but i censor myself more than i like im fully aware that what seems to be anonymous now could haunt me later i know im taking a risk being political online but i refuse to stop fighting for change things are too screwed up to not speak up i dont search for things im curious about that might trigger an unnecessary nsa investigation im using search engines that claim to be more private than google is i dont want my searches sold or analyzed by others i like googles search engine but dont like what they do with the information it gathers i also switched to linux online because i got tired of microsoft meddling with my computer and not trusting it with my documents privacy i use noscript now when i browse the internet i want to minimize opportunities for unwanted script to add keylogging or other viruses to my computer worrying about privacy online has definitely diminished the internet experience for me

technology,not_removed,was this because of the apps political stance or simply because it was a bad app or perhaps it was breaking one of apples many rules at this point theres no indication which it is save the torches for later
technology,not_removed,apple as a private company is well within their rights to discontinue a business relationship with an entity they feel is harmful they should not as a wild example so far out of left field it couldnt be compared with any specific modern events be compelled to publish say nazi propoganda and deceptive news articles surely we can agree upon that
technology,not_removed,im not sure how i feel about this sure there is a lot of bullshit on breitbart but theres also a lot of bullshit on huffporeddit and they arent banned neither is drudge report that said here are some headlines from breitbart birth control makes women unattractive and crazy theres no hiring bias against women in tech they just suck at interviews the solution to online harassment is simple women should log off racist pronazi roots of planned parenthood revealed
technology,not_removed,devils advocate counterarguement theres a distinction between being compelled to publish content and what happened here breitbart presumably had to submit an app for approval and got it approved by apple they only care now that theres a public uproar and are trying to make themselves look good they chose to approve it the only reason this is happening is because apple is trying to look good in light of public controversy also an even crazier devils advocate counterarguement lets say apple was being required to host certain apps and couldnt pick and choose based on their personal approval of the politicsopinion off the app maker or in response to social outrage under the logic that on apples end the content itself doesnt matter since its all just and using up space on their servers basically the same arguement for net neutrality what would be the issue exactly you can say it would harm their business because people wouldnt want to support apple if they associated with them but if they and every other company were legally obligated to not allow their personal biases interfere with what they host then that wouldnt be the case no now i im not saying i necessarily argue with anything im proposing above but i think that the arguements themselves are interesting for the record i think breitbart is a horrible source of news and i can count the times theyve actually put out good content or covered legimate stories other sites havent on a single hand what i am going to say seriously and not just as a devils advocate poistion is that i think the as a private company its totally okay for line of thinking is complete bullshit yes its only technically censorship if the goverment does it but that doesnt mean private entities doing stuff cant be harmful look up the motion pictures production code or the comics code authority both of those were not backed by any sort of legal power yet they caused creative freedom to be strangled for decades and led to the blacklisting of countless film makers and comic book authorsartists

technology,not_removed,why you want a president you can trust president gets the full briefing and grills the people bringing the report to him when hes satisfied theyre not full of crap he acts appropriately representative government means the people dont decide the people decide on the persons who will decide obama got the briefing and decided to act against the russians in a traditional manner trump might decide differently but you would bring the report to him in a different manner than you would obama so who knows
technology,not_removed,but they did elect a completely incompetent person the usa election looks completely ridiculous from the outside the rest of us well the vast majority anyway just feel sorry for you guys now you have years of this arse clown to deal with
technology,not_removed,who cafes anyway if what youre saying is true everyone should care
technology,not_removed,we elected and reelected someone far less capable barack obama
technology,not_removed,that is not the general consensus from the outside world barack is regarded as one of the best you have had sorry that you dont see that

technology,not_removed,what sort of exploits would this allow for
technology,not_removed,this article is bad op and you should feel bad source years in it
technology,not_removed,how it makes valid points about the public being clueless and the iot being dangerous
technology,not_removed,short answer no long answer sort of but its not something you need to worry about in most common use cases the two biggest things you need to pay attention to to prolong battery life are not to let the battery deeply discharge or to get too hot try not to go below too often and definitely dont let it die completely if you do recharge it right away dont leave it in a hot car or direct sunlight or anywhere else it where it will get hot keeping it at for long periods of time weeks or months at a time can decrease the life too but most people dont have a problem doing that with phones
technology,not_removed,no if you overcharge the new li ions batteries they can explode or burst into flames because of that they have circuitry that prevent over charging
technology,not_removed,and get sued by every gop ag in the country not to mention every republican congressman

technology,not_removed,dell xps would be my pick you could also look at the samsung notebook if youre willing to trade a little bit of performance for a thinner and lighter design basically make sure you get a system with a good keyboard at least a decent trackpad and a pretty thinlight design dont worry so much about gaming a laptop probably wont make you happy without introducing other sacrifices i remember trying to lug a behemoth of a laptop across campus not doing that again

technology,not_removed,i would suggest eurocom especially if you can manage their student discount plenty of usb ports sometimes even type c and killer graphics cards
technology,not_removed,windows then ive got nothing are those pretty much all exactly the same
technology,not_removed,a mac that you can install windows on its the sad reality of pc hardware
technology,not_removed,all around usability but it will be my only computer as i wont have a desktop what are you suggesting
technology,not_removed,um not in the slightest
technology,not_removed,how big do you need the screen something like would work well for you its midsized not too small not too massive its got an intel core gtx ssd thats a full on gaming pc for like i would take that laptop and im a gamer that will handle literally anything you throw at it thats a more powerful computer than a lot of desktops its overkill futureproofed and still under budget asus is a good manufacturer too
technology,not_removed,because the shell looks slightly different
technology,not_removed,any drawbacks
technology,not_removed,honestly the specs are pretty great its a well reviewed computer stars its priced well has a bunch of usb ports has the best wifi receiver standard you can get wifi ac card reader hdmi port it has a month warranty you can probably get a longer warranty if you get it through amazon they generally have something pop up asking if you want to add it on on paper it looks like a fantastic computer all i can say is read the reviews see what the people with the one stars complained about and see how many star reviews there are compared to and stari just checked there is solitary star review specs wise its great you just have to decide whether you like it and remember if you get it on amazonwhich i highly recommend their returns policy is probably the best anywhere if you dont like it send it back and get a different one id say amazon is the lowest risk place to get a laptop especially if you are buying it directly from amazonthis laptop is sold directly by amazon then they bend over backwards to make sure you are happy
technology,not_removed,rothken it is a glorified set of hyperlinks very much like you would get from a search engine like google were not able to find any cases where a hyperlink was considered direct wilful infringement us congress judges and either future president whats a hyperlink
technology,not_removed,why the fuck is this tagged net neutrality it has absolutely zero to do with it
technology,not_removed,i really miss kickasss top categories i dont know whats new now
technology,not_removed,fuck the feds for taking kat down i used that site for over years allegedly
technology,not_removed,a lot of good that did kimcom
technology,not_removed,didnt read but wasnt the kim dotcom thing a mutually hated thing
technology,not_removed,its no coincidence both defendants being represented by this lawyer are guilty as hell
technology,not_removed,i cant wait for dotcom to get the boot from my country
technology,not_removed,well considering the fact that freshoutofschool law clerks do most of the research and writing for a judge this shouldnt actually be an issue unless it comes up during oral argument and the judge hasnt read his bench brief
technology,not_removed,hillary clinton i wiped the servers with a cloth is the hyperlink a bus service
technology,not_removed,there is precedent
technology,not_removed,i get where hes coming from and i support torrenting but at the same time i wouldnt be surprised if this sort of argument doesnt go very far i mean its a bit ludicrous to expect the technicalities of the situation to eliminate the idea of intent yes theyre just hyperlinks but obviously the website in its entirety exists for a specific reason to share those hyperlinks and the target content that they lead to i just imagine some italian mobster trying to justify some sort of drugtrafficking drop box on a street corner yea its just a box theres drugs in the box someone comes along opens the box and takes out the drugs and then they may or may not leave a big stack of money in the box wuttaboutit its like ya okay
technology,not_removed,is it like a chain that moves really fast or something can i wipe it down with a cloth
technology,not_removed,since kat and piratebay are gone where the hell do i get my torrents from now most torrent sites are shit and also have no comments
technology,not_removed,it already is back just under a new domain
technology,not_removed,its about legal stuff on the net so obviously its about net neutrality right
technology,not_removed,if youre on demonoid they have a top torrents feature on the navigation that shows the top downloaded over the last hours i believe
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,it did he wasnt extradited he got some of his money back when youre up against the fbi and the us government id say thats a pretty good job and i think the case is still ongoing even
technology,not_removed,he fought and won
technology,not_removed,i get the sense that this comment could easily be taken sarcastically but in reality it should be taken literally because it actually did do him a lot of good
technology,not_removed,elaborate to my knowledge he won some major battles against the usa
technology,not_removed,cant agree more he has to be one of the most arrogant assholes ever to set foot in this country mega aside i loved that site the guy is a royal prick
technology,not_removed,i thought you give it ritalin
technology,not_removed,if im reading this correctly the end result set no precedent at all because it never went to trial im not a lawyer though so in what way does this set precedent
technology,not_removed,now richard odwyer is a racing driver thats kickass good for him
technology,not_removed,making a map telling people where the drop box is probably is notmight be a crime owning a publicly accessible wall where people attach maps is not a crime in most places in your analogy the owner of the actual box would still be in possession of the contraband the wall owner is only indirectly allowing information sharing which isnt by itself criminal edited for improved analogy
technology,not_removed,but was it wrong to tell someone where the box is is a hyperlink like telling someone where something is you get an address but you would still need to ask the dns server and routing tables for the actual location however is kat even giving hyperlinks all torrenting nowadays uses magnet links those are not hyperlinks a magnet link does not tell where something is it tells what something is a secure hash of the file so you know which file you want and how to test if you have the correct file although it still does include a list of trackers to ask it does not say anything about the location of the file that is not like being asked for heroin and telling someone where the drug box is that is like saying heroin is diacetate and here is a list of companies synthesizing chemicals
technology,not_removed,the website in its entirety is basically a very specific kind of search engine with the recent ruling where yahoo and google and other search engines dont have to censor their search results to not include torrents you can use any search engine and find any torrent you want your analogy is wrong too the drug dealer put the drugs in the box and owns the box torrent sites dont host any copyrighted files their users might so a better analogy would be if you ran a post office and some drug dealers used your po box as a drug drop off point the cops can come into your post office and say hey those guys used your po box as a drug drop off point were going to arrest you for trafficking drugs theyd lose in court because the actual traffickers would be the drug dealers who used that box as a drop off point
technology,not_removed,sharing hyperlinks isnt illegal or wrong though just look at reddit hey lets ban cell phones because their intent is letting criminals contact each other and organize crime also its not a box with drugs its a box with the address of the drugs nothing illegal here go to the address specified then you can charge people with possession
technology,not_removed,kat is there to allow users to share torrent files they also complied with quite a few dmca takedown requests its the users that added the content not the ownerskinda comparable to reddit tbh
technology,not_removed,i feel like a better parallel is hey theres a dude around the corner who is giving out free stuff he stole it all from macys i dont believe thats illegal
technology,not_removed,our whole legal system consists of the specific technicalities of the situation of course it will work
technology,not_removed,why whats wrong with tpb
technology,not_removed,pirate bay is not gone
technology,not_removed,torrentzeu
technology,not_removed,pirate bay is still there and is fine if you think its gone you may well be in the uk where our glorious leaders have decided to block it use pirateproxy instead
technology,not_removed,none of those sites are goine the domains can be closed but there are plenty of mirrors just a bit of google is enough i just accessed a mirror or kat and its working
technology,not_removed,you know how the series have a suffix yeah start there
technology,not_removed,ive been using but its not great
technology,not_removed,thanks us government
technology,not_removed,which one they all look like copies
technology,not_removed,is demonoid back havent logged in since they went dark for a while a few years back
technology,not_removed,that was a great anime
technology,not_removed,copyright infringing certainly still theft traditionally relies on the concept of depriving someone else of the item in question you steal something from someone such that they no longer have it
technology,not_removed,the extradition fight was an uphill battle and hes doing really well of course when the us government is out to get you youve got some serious problems next thing you know batman is pulling you out of a building tethered to a plane and dragging your ass to the us
technology,not_removed,his us case is dead but the us prosecutor running it just keeps applying for extensions and filing motions to extend out the case and have it not conclude in his favor if it were to ever get to a judge or trial kimcom would win in a hearbeat as they have not been able to prove anything to the extent of which they charged him
technology,not_removed,did he on the december north shore district court judge nevin dawson announced that dotcom and the three other megaupload cofounders were eligible for extradition he said the us had a large body of evidence which supported a prima facie case looks like he is losing and just blowing through money the us prints money so you can guess who will run out first
technology,not_removed,is it illegal in new zealand to be a royal prick nbsp not from what ive seen of some of your government figures
technology,not_removed,hes a royal prick but at least hes fighting for customers rather than against them frankly i think youre the real prick
technology,not_removed,lol you sound bitter he may be an asshole but hes a business man that made a fortune and fought the us government and won
technology,not_removed,making that map with the knowledge that it is being used for a crime would be aiding and abetting in some states aiding and abetting can get you the same punishment as actually committing the crime yourself
technology,not_removed,lets ban cell phones because their intent is letting criminals contact each other and organize crime but thats not the intent of cellphones unless we are trying to be purposefully dense we all know what the intent of a site like kickasstorrents is
technology,not_removed,nothing by itself but the fact that its still the same theres no innovation in the piracy scene and thats a problem too much centralization everyone used kat now its gone we need a resilient decentralized alternative preferably one that even supports the torrent protocol itself so the swarms are also secure edit no no more sites or other centralized entities that can be easily taken down
technology,not_removed,it looked shady when it came back up
technology,not_removed,isnt tbp run by feds as a giant honeypot now
technology,not_removed,um a lot of illegitimate illegitimate stuff popped around
technology,not_removed,the ui is still stuck in years ago
technology,not_removed,it looks nice though
technology,not_removed,thats basically what i meant a bunch of clones
technology,not_removed,im fairly sure you still need an invite to make an account
technology,not_removed,it is a shell of its former self
technology,not_removed,you read the manga httpsgitlabcomubunchutranslatorsubunchu
technology,not_removed,was torrenting part of your plan
technology,not_removed,yeah its really kind of bullshit the way the entire case went the initial raid was found illegal too youd think thatd invalidate everything else but nope that and the way the fbi handled the data servers was bullshit too
technology,not_removed,well that and they shut him down without any trial or process making an example of him would be a bonus but shuttering mega was the real intention
technology,not_removed,can you give an example edit obviously not these downvotes are hilarious
technology,not_removed,at least hes fighting for customers hes fighting for himself he does not give a shit about you or the ideals that people like you hold him up as a symbol of hes a crook a liar and while i do not necessarily side with the us govt in his current mess hes as big a money grubbing cunt as most of the ceos reddit holds up as the closest thing to satan
technology,not_removed,yeah hes not you may want to look into how he actually operated kimcom is a massive piece of shit dude paid users to upload stolen content and then purposely set the limit of takedown requests to be lower than the upload rate thats just the tip of the iceberg
technology,not_removed,the guy literally tried to buy an election
technology,not_removed,it would depend on the circumstances agreed its a weak analogy making the specific map pick up stolen goods from bank job behind the bike racks would be conspiratorial but here kat is probably more like a map library or something where essentially other anonymous people can come in and leave new maps there and other anonymous people can come in to look at the maps who knows what the maps are to the owner doesnt have time to look at every map and go see whats at the x its not even established the store owner has ever looked at any of the maps or has knowledge of where they go its not his job to be evaluating the map droppers anyway the laws around this have teeth primarily on the act of distribution of the actual content links are always going to be only an indirect connection
technology,not_removed,yes it is the intent of cellphones is to let criminals communicate and organize crime is there some techonology that stops criminals from communicating or at least from discussing crime that they organize no allowing these things is clearly the intent of cell phones and im sorry you have multiple personality disorder and all of your personalities are pretending to know the intent of kickasstorrent without ever being able to state it because you dont really know it youre one of those people who go to court and say unless someone here is stupid we all know what happened so lets just declare the defendant guilty and move on with our day
technology,not_removed,a site that searches all torrent sites at once brilliant
technology,not_removed,there are plenty of other sites that serve you well for most popular content
technology,not_removed,if it is shit downloaded the eric andre show and and also adobe premiere
technology,not_removed,so we shouldnt be using it
technology,not_removed,its functional though
technology,not_removed,that means it is not back at all these clones are exactly that clones they do not have the ability for users to login and submit new stuff and they are not hosted by the staff of kat therefore they are not kat
technology,not_removed,no you are using goods without purchase if you ride a train without buying a ticket you dont steal a train ticket you just ride the train without buying a ticket just like pirating the train still does its journey a lot of people still ride and buy a ticket and the company still makes a lot of money there is also no way to prove you would have bought a ticket to begin with so its not exactly a lost revenue either either you wouldnt pay that price or wouldnt pay any price you get the idea though its not theft its a case of not paying
technology,not_removed,i mean thats a valid stance for certain but it sure as hell isnt the only viewpoint on the issue it just isnt that simple really from a legal or ethical standpoint for the majority of our legal history it has been a civil matter and infringement on copyright carried only compensatory penalties you could sue someone for money but you couldnt get them chucked in jail more recently though it has become a criminal matter but only because lobbying has been successful for the change
technology,not_removed,that and the way the fbi handled the data servers was bullshit too they quit paying the bill and the company that owned the servers just wiped and reused themas expected really everyones data is gone i wonder when can sue the us prosecutors officer for loss of data and irreplaceable photos that i had on there
technology,not_removed,i thought he wasnt in america
technology,not_removed,you are right it is intuitively clear that apple and google made their phones with the intention that criminals could use them to commit crimes and youre probably also correct in saying that there is no way to know what a site like kickasstorrents was intended for despite the way they categorize their links movie torrents tv shows torrents there is just no way kats administrators could know it would be overwhelmingly used for torrenting copyrighted material
technology,not_removed,torrentzeu does this doesnt it
technology,not_removed,no no more sites thats my point we already have sites that search all torrent sites and theyre shit
technology,not_removed,there have been several of those
technology,not_removed,torrentzeu
technology,not_removed,maybe a network that cant be taken down like a program you download
technology,not_removed,ipfs can be for storage whereas zeronet can be for the sites they go hand in hand imo
technology,not_removed,theyre steps in the right direction but far from solid alternative unfortunately bitcloud isnt looking so good either that would have been the allencompassing distributed decentralized internet layer but development has severely halted for several years
technology,not_removed,zeronet isnt fully it uses a tracker to find peers where as ipfs works just on dht
technology,not_removed,invest in a vpn yo
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,it is functional if and only if you know exactly what you want to get
technology,not_removed,exactly sure there was a lot of pirated content on there im sure but people did use it as legit file storage too
technology,not_removed,i dont know what happened but that website used to be good but recently its just bad i dont know why
technology,not_removed,never heard of it but sure
technology,not_removed,so a program like the old limewire kazaa and ares i remember you could search directly through those programs
technology,not_removed,zeronet is a fantastic web and there are already some pretty full featured torrent sites on it
technology,not_removed,that is how emule and gnutella were i could never find anything on those networks
technology,not_removed,im not trying to rationalise this it is piracy and it is illegal i dont pretend it isnt the argument of its not theft is useless in any legal situation if i wanted to argue for piracy i would say it is only of any use to society when companies develop monopolies and hike their prices as a result or when they develop ridiculous systems to prevent piracy that makes the paying consumers life hell eg drm where the drm servers are intermittent and crash in those cases piracy is the only way these companies will not continue to dick over the consumer for pointless pathetic reasons that achieve nothing but it doesnt change the legality of it it is still illegal
technology,not_removed,wats bad about it
technology,not_removed,kinda but more like an entire new internet and most importantly not centralized limewire was centralized as fuck it only took taking down limewire to take down everything with it this would not be possible in a decentralized internet layer
technology,not_removed,those were iirc they didnt really operate like how torrents are or maybe they did
technology,not_removed,its a good idea but currently the implementation is not really any better something on ipfs would actually be fully however
technology,not_removed,entire algorithm or the index got altered for some reason used to be up to date with everything but now it wont show up properly or its just filled with pornbollywood stuff this changed happened like a few months ago
technology,not_removed,im not actually involved in the development of either i used both of them and from what i concluded zeronet is killing it on user experience its sooo easy to get a website up and running its amazing ipfs however works amazing technically but its a massive pain to get a website running on it last time i checked you needed to publish your key every hours to keep your namekey online but the actual file sharing stuff in the background is so well made what i think would work best is the zeronet userend bits ontop of the ipfs network
technology,not_removed,hm possible sure just needs someone to spend time on it i think the actual ideas from zeronet on how things should work might be more valuable than the code itself right now the ipfs devs are pretty busy making sure ipfs is rock solid and everything will be perfect for many applications and it really seems like they are doing that well if you just have one static file ipfs can handle that so well you can interact with files on ipfs just like you could with files locally for example you can give vlc a file to open which is not actually on your computer and ipfs will start streaming it to vlc i recently came across this article ever heard of that project havent seen that in particular but i do try to keep up with the latest in i have been watching various projects such as ipfs zeronet and tox to see where it all goes there is no doubt to me that is the future i just hope it comes in time to save us from the crap that the internet is quickly becoming
technology,not_removed,i dont intend to allow an alwayson spyware listening device in my home ever if i can avoid it
technology,not_removed,i dont think its reasonable to lump all of these together each makes money in different ways some sketchier than others apple makes siri so they can sell you more of their hardware and services amazon and google made alexa and google now to learn more about you so they can sell ads
technology,not_removed,the scary thought is being unable to buy a dumb appliance because every new appliance is built to be a part of the internet of things i can buy a dumb tv now and avoid all that smart tv shit i can be smart about how i secure my smartphone i can unplug my webcam mic when not in use i can pull ethernet and power cables when my desktop is powered down etc what happens when every device is always connected and the entire fucking populace is too stupid to realize why thats terrible or even care
technology,not_removed,the scary thought is being unable to buy a dumb appliance because every new appliance is built to be a part of the internet of things i think the reasonably technically savvy will be able to prevent devices from connecting to their home internet ie my fridge might have wfi but that doesnt mean i have give it the password to my router
technology,not_removed,i thought politicians were the ones distorting perception welp who am i to say
technology,not_removed,whatever she probably belongs to the same cult as park in south korea
technology,not_removed,send in the spam message mass tweets aaaaaaaa aaaaaaab aaaaaaac aaaaaaad aaaaaae aaaaaaf
technology,not_removed,good work now hell change his handle and while your detective work seems spot on what have you gained by letting him know that you know who he is
technology,not_removed,plot twist this is deliberate and is the fbis version of a job interview
technology,not_removed,remindme year google if ashley feinberg still has her job
technology,not_removed,i care deeply about privacy treasure it i have an instagram account with nine followers nobody is getting in theyre all immediate relatives and one daughters serious boyfriend i let them in because theyre serious enough i dont want anybody looking at my photos i treasure my privacy and security on the internet he values his own privacysecurity yet fights against privacysecurity
technology,not_removed,looks like lots of overtime coming up for instagram engineers to fix that privacy loophole
technology,not_removed,this author deserves a job at the fbi
technology,not_removed,was he secretly leaking all that info over these accounts
technology,not_removed,what a fucking moron if i were an fbi higherup and had a secret twitter account id name it bananapoop and follow one random norweigan pop singer a week god our government is pathetic when it comes to cybersecurity honestly the only reason every single politician isnt hacked is because most of them dont warrant the effort could probably hack trumps twitter in twenty minutes if they wanted to
technology,not_removed,now hes going to create a new account
technology,not_removed,thats the point though there was already nothing gained other than an interesting story so he burned a useless bridge
technology,not_removed,if it was easy enough for the author to figure out then someone else would have and broke the story first
technology,not_removed,i dont think he expected to gain anything by keeping it to himself either its very unlikely comey will do anything of interest with those accounts it just illustrates how difficult social media privacy is
technology,not_removed,yet fights against privacysecurity thats like asking a security researcher why they fight to hack computers when they value not getting hacked
technology,not_removed,looks like he just uses them to like stories that make him look good and to keep tabs on his daughters boyfriend basically just dad stuff
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,well he couldve kept it to himself and just watched that account for until comey said something damaging in private theeeen couldve accepted a bribe to suppress the evidence after all thats what comey would do
technology,not_removed,a security researcher doesnt fight to legally force encryption backdoors
technology,not_removed,so if pp locked my account where i couldnt access it for any reason would i be entitled had an account that was locked in so i made a new one
technology,not_removed,looks like ill get at the most kind of feels like a courtordered reacharound paypal has fucked so many people in the ass over this sort of thing that im surprised this didnt happen sooner ebay and paypal have both got their heads up their asses in regards to holds and funds availability i spent a lot of time building a reputation with ebay so i would be released from their funds availability program and could get funds cleared to ship items with i jumped through their hoops and finally got released from their program only to have paypal then jump in and seperately begin holding funds for every transaction claiming it was only for high risk items apparently a scratched up game boy advance is high risk fuck them ive given up selling because its too fucking stressful for someone who doesnt have a huge amount of spare cash in the first place
technology,not_removed,this is probably like the red bull lawsuit i put in my information and about months later i got a check for about
technology,not_removed,shit i wonder if notch will do it i remember when he had like hundreds of thousands of dollars put on hold for a while though hes a billionaire so probably doesnt care at this point
technology,not_removed,i also received this email and didnt know if it was legit should i follow through oo
technology,not_removed,if you are a current or former user of paypal in the united states
technology,not_removed,bull shit doesnt apply to other countries
technology,not_removed,does anyone know how to get a hold of the law firm managing this class action ive got a cherry case worth the perfect amount which at the time in was nearing the small claims max ive filled out the original forms for dont include me in the class but please contact me and it has been months without contact
technology,not_removed,i ran a convention once and the day of the convention paypal shut down our entire paypal account for security reason we had to tell people to use cash only or they couldnt register and ultimately we lost hundreds of dollars as people because it shut down our entire registration system paypals reason we saw a lot of payments come in from the same ip hotel wireless so we terminated the account oh but they couldnt be bothered to contact me and told me to call back monday this was on a friday and we were shut down the entire weekend for something that could have been resolved in a single phone call
technology,not_removed,took a gift payment of for my startup it was a donation button but the intent was clear had my account locked for months while i sorted it out am based in australia though so i guess im not going to get rich any time soon
technology,not_removed,i suggest no one take this deal just because it protects them from being sued by you again you dont know what can happen this future
technology,not_removed,neat i sold some stuff to someone and had to freight it to him this guy knows he bought of stuff and he put his business address on the payment so i ship it to him and he rejects the shipment claiming he told me he would need a lift gate he did not and fedex charged me another because his business address is his house in a tight neighborhood after rejecting the shipping it was sent back to the fedex dock and fedex had to deal with me to get it back i had to pay to freight it backthat was there then back the guy had his credit card reverse the transaction which put my paypal acount about in the red the best part is after getting his money back the guy drives up to the fedex dock and tries to take delivery anyway the manager there had already spoken to me and wouldnt allow it and he got belligerent and rude with hershe ended up giving me a discount on the freight over that i refused to cooperate with paypal on the matter and they suspended my account the only victory ive had is they tried to put it on my creditwhich i contested with threats of legal action and that went away thats my storyim down but maybe i can get a smidgen back
technology,not_removed,had them hold a ebay sale and a refund a few years back in for one refund pls
technology,not_removed,had my account closed by them last month that same account had numerous times where i got locked outrestricted and in some cases had over on hold for a few weeks at a time would i be sol since i can no longer access the account for proof
technology,not_removed,i got a letter in the mail saying paypal is giving me back dollars for their pay pal credit system that fucked me when i go to the site it asks me to login credit site was different from paypal regular then i do and it days that site got merged back into pay pal under a different name go to the new site and login and it has no memory of me having credit with them it just keeps asking me to sign up for pay pal credit so i dont know how i can get my dollars which would actually be a huge help in my life right now
technology,not_removed,man this site looks so skeezy
technology,not_removed,what if you cant remember
technology,not_removed,is it past the deadline edit oct is the deadline
technology,not_removed,the big question is will paypal stopping doing this
technology,not_removed,i dont want a petty or so or whatever id get i just want my paypal account back ill try to be brief but summer of maybe i caught some jackass who tried to fleece me out of by transferring himself money through paypal getting the payment canceled and my money back wasnt a hastle but having my account reactivated frozen until the year has been so difficult that i gave up and havent used paypal since the issue to prove my identityown existence i have to enter the credit card number of my old long since expired and not to mention shredded credit card which was compromised obviously i suppose yeah i could just make a new account but im not going to merely out of principle obviously comprised im not the type to save any credit card numbers or tie them to any account ever never have and i never will so the only way he could have possibly tried to pay himself was if he had my credit card information
technology,not_removed,i got an email from them a while back about this and i received didnt ask any questions just spent that shit
technology,not_removed,i canceled my account because of this i had twice them lock me down the first time over some absolute horse shit the second time over some even bigger horse shit i had to remake an account because their password server also screwed me and about half a million others back in when they migrated a bunch of data it just stopped working and they kept not giving me access to the old account took over a month and like ten calls to fix i will still never use this company
technology,not_removed,paypal stole from me and said i owed them an additional that i most definitely never paid after the funds fully cleared they can rot in fucking hell
technology,not_removed,i just swore off ebaypaypal for life thats all thepayment i need
technology,not_removed,maybe this will end up like the dram settlement where it pays up
technology,not_removed,sign me up i got locked out of my account from paypal
technology,not_removed,ive had about accounts suspended and closed how much should we expect to get
technology,not_removed,can i get a cash payment if i sold something on ebay and they held my money
technology,not_removed,had them close my account with a dollar in it and sent me to collections its still dinging my credit
technology,not_removed,any chance i can claim from the uk this shit happened to me as a seller a lot
technology,not_removed,is there a way to discover if this applies in your account history
technology,not_removed,i had two people submit fraudulent claims even though i had confirmed delivery receipts from usps one person simply said the merchandise wasnt as described and did not have to provide any proof and paypal sided with them i was out the price of the merchandise which was brand new and the transaction fees they held all my funds then started charging me more fees before suspending my completely legitimate account i fought it for about three months before giving up
technology,not_removed,anyone else feel kind of scummy taking any class action lawsuits
technology,not_removed,im curious too i attempted to sell a final fantasy characters info on ebay in my bids were almost before ebay shut it down i was only able to get contact info from one bidder before the sale was locked we got in touch and i honored his bid we did the paypal swap pp then flagged the transactionas i assume ebay and they shared info and locked us both out of our accounts completely we jumped through hoops for days and it finally went through but was a major pain in the ass for a relatively small transaction we couldnt use either site for the duration as well
technology,not_removed,this i never received any emailed notification of this so thanks for posting the notice pdf linked here says the amount you may get is based on the amount held but my account was locked so many years ago that i dont even remember the amount what recourse is there
technology,not_removed,how did you figure
technology,not_removed,i would probably get around as well im on mobile and at work so i cant read thoroughly so how can i make a claim do i have to go through individually every single transaction i did and look at how long they held the funds
technology,not_removed,im still waiting on my tuna coupons 😡
technology,not_removed,i got from the dram settlement so id say its worth at least trying if you fall in to the class
technology,not_removed,useless ticket vouchers for everyone
technology,not_removed,i never got my redbull or tuna settlement checks but i did get from some a protein shake settlement months after i signed up so i have that going for me
technology,not_removed,i just got my vibram check like three years after the fact
technology,not_removed,you were supposed to opt for the free case of red bull
technology,not_removed,my red bull settlement literally came in last week i got one for naked juice about a month ago after like years
technology,not_removed,they dont check the people who sign up really the only time red flags get shot up is if you sign up for every or damn near every class action lawsuit that comes up they will then start denying your claims
technology,not_removed,well i got like from the apple ebook suit which was a fair bit more than i was expecting
technology,not_removed,if i were him id do it just because paypal is such a bunch of fucknuts with this shit ive never seen a bank hold on to your money because they feel like it anywhere like paypal does meanwhile they build interest on every penny of your money they hold on to and you cant do shit about it and also get nothing back for it
technology,not_removed,paging uxnotch
technology,not_removed,i didnt receive this email but i would like to know if it is legit i got fucked over by a seller in and paypal decided in their favor
technology,not_removed,i would and it does seem legit i signed up for it back in january most times theyre like to but a while ago i got like from a different settlement from bill me later
technology,not_removed,this really shouldve been specified in the title of the post to avoid wasting peoples time but hey the general consensus on reddit atm is that all the userbase is american
technology,not_removed,only if you want to live free
technology,not_removed,bummer paypal didnt draw any international boundaries when they raped their clients why shouldnt more lawyers jump in to make the suit international
technology,not_removed,thats a really small convention for just hundreds of dollars
technology,not_removed,also it looks like most claimants who had less than frozen will only get between and
technology,not_removed,its important to realise the point of the site the lawyers representing the class are obligated to try to collect the names of class membersbut they really dont give a shit how many people actually respond so they put very little money into it etc
technology,not_removed,all these settlement website looks like a scam and sleazy i remember a few years back there was a settlement for a new york tour i was eligible but the website was so sketch i didnt enter any info i even google the settlement and it was legit but i just couldnt trust that website
technology,not_removed,i thought the same but was paid out for ea sports and red bull
technology,not_removed,the bigger question is why are people still using paypal
technology,not_removed,what state was that most dont allow lawyers to present their clients even corporations are prevented they must send an employee not a lawyerbut again depends on what state judges do make mistakesalot more then they would admit too corporation or other legal entity — a corporation or other legal entity that is not a natural person can be represented by a regular employee an officer or a director a partnership can be represented by a partner or regular employee of the partnership the representative may not be an attorney or person whose only job is to represent the party in small claims court an attorney may appear to represent a law firms as long as that attorney is a general partner of the law firm or is an officer of the corporation however in both instances all the other members of the partnership and all the other officers of the corporations have to be attorneys as well
technology,not_removed,yeah but paypal is far scummier than the lawyer so im okay with it fuck everything about paypal
technology,not_removed,unless youre leaving out some minor details you might not be entitled to anything what you should have done is sell some cheap necklace or any nuance for and then include some character info for free thats how you play the game
technology,not_removed,what were the ffxi stats ive had a character since december japanese importer
technology,not_removed,same here i remember the amount but my paypal cases dashboard no longer shows the case even under closed cases my account was for nearly two years and locked because a fraudulent buyer reversed charges after receiving an ebay item i shipped and paypal refused to accept tracking information and photos of the item in the box with the shipping label visable as proof of shipment they finally released the funds back to me two years later but i no longer have emails or proof of the event
technology,not_removed,finally someone else like me who opted for the in tuna vouchers instead of the cash payout neither of which will be honored now anyway 🖕
technology,not_removed,same here i noticed that the starkist tuna wasnt as good as chicken of the sea and decided to change brands permanently if the difference hadnt been so blatant upon opening the can i wouldnt have remembered that i ever bought it
technology,not_removed,sorry to tell you there will be no tuna coupons at least for now
technology,not_removed,when did you sign up sometimes these can take years before you get anything
technology,not_removed,i got a check from i think walmart because i have a prepaid cell phone and i didnt have to sign up for anything they just sent it to me i didnt even buy it from walmart
technology,not_removed,just got for that as well im definately going for this paypal suit though i had my account suspended with almost in there then they decided they were going to close my account refund all of the money back to the customers i had already sent out a buuunch of merchandise so the was stolen and i completely lost all of my stock
technology,not_removed,i opted for the red bull but it was quite ironic youre complaining about the quality and misleading information on the drink so as a settlement you accept more of said product
technology,not_removed,i dont drink energy drinks often once in a blue moon sometimes on the harvest moon occasionally on a blood moon
technology,not_removed,they dont earn interest on account holds theyre kept in interest free accounts bank accounts dont even earn interest anymore anyway
technology,not_removed,it seems that this lawsuit is more about paypal locking your account for no reason and holding on to your money because they feel like it either for a long period of time or indefinitely i didnt read everything legalize is a bit much for me this early in the day so i might be wrong but thats the idea i got from what i saw
technology,not_removed,atm more like always
technology,not_removed,as paypal is a regulated financial services provider in the eu its subject to very tight control and ombudsman rulings i dont see how a complaining consumer in the eu would suffer under this behaviour anyway to get as far as such a lawsuit tbh
technology,not_removed,usa usa usa
technology,not_removed,what if i prefer to die hard
technology,not_removed,but freedom isnt free it costs a buck o five
technology,not_removed,we had a few hundred people not too big we were able to find some workarounds but not with paypal i dont know how much it impacted us hundreds a thousand or more small con but we definitely felt the impact and it cost us
technology,not_removed,you know how i know youre like years old you can name like conventions if you had a gun to your head when there are hundreds if not thousands every year for various things not everything is comiccon sweetheart
technology,not_removed,if you have an alternate claim for documented damages of up to they only give you characters to type in your entire claim not sure what kind of claim theyre looking for but i cant even begin to claim how fucked up paypal is in cha
technology,not_removed,you probably shouldnt lets be honest most likely this information is stored on a barely secured if at all server because they dont really care about security all they care about is doing what theyre legally obligated to do unless i were owed over i wouldnt consider it and thats never the case for class actions like this lawyers do them because they get a fuckton of money but the general people that qualify for them get so little its not even worth your time
technology,not_removed,what other options are there for that niche
technology,not_removed,thats what a room mate did he was selling his childhood baseball cards he is not a professional sports memorabilia dealer he just got lucky before i knew it he was flipping signed mint ernie banks cards we didnt know that some states regulate sports memorabilia it was around locked new acct locked new acct locked eventually he gave up and became a meth addict
technology,not_removed,a buddy from my home town told me a similar trick he is a big fisherman and always fishes during the salmon run it is not uncommon for people to try and buy your freshly caught salmon off of youbut it is illegal to sell the fish sometimes game wardens dress in plain clothes and try to buy a fish from you my buddy said if anyone asks to buy your fish tell them you cant sell them a fish but you can sell them the lucky lure that caught the fish and they can have the fish for free
technology,not_removed,but then the buyer could be like i never received the necklace to paypal and try to charge back
technology,not_removed,it was a all subs had full hecatomb thf got hands😤 nin war homam and almost max character merits i was one of the few nas on valefor server to get a ridill so thats where the sale value jumped up so high
technology,not_removed,im well aware i violated tos of the two sites as well as square enix im just curious if the actions in the lawsuit complaint led them to investigate something they might otherwise not have which prevented me from using the service or accessing my own accountfunds they obviously discharged the suspension and let the transaction through after investigating so i dont believe anything wrongtechnically happened
technology,not_removed,welcome to class action lawsuits the only real winners in these are the lawyers ive been signing up for these things for about years now and its really crazy so many things you buy have some sort of falsehood that they go after it ranges from redbull saying they have more energy than a premium cup of coffee to some product with an all natural label without meeting that i think i get a year because you had to buy such products in a wide time frame
technology,not_removed,well of course the lawyers are getting much more than any of the payees thats the premise of the classaction lawsuit so many people think that lawyers are gaming victims by taking all the money but its really the opposite class action suits take years and the attorneys pursuing them are putting huge amounts of time and resource into making the case possible with class actions its generally the case that the individual plaintiffs dont have enough at stake to justify paying for a highpowered attorney and so by combining the plaintiffs the attorneys have a chance at a large settlement or judgement but even then its only a chance theres no guarantee that the case will be won so the attorneys have to be paid well or else we wouldnt have access to class action suits where many people where harmed only a little bit by a large company
technology,not_removed,for this issue you cant just sign away rights no sane judge would honor that
technology,not_removed,do you work for free
technology,not_removed,i just googled it the other day sounds like its just delayed
technology,not_removed,would you say thats too much tuna
technology,not_removed,i went for the cash payout never received
technology,not_removed,bumblebee tuna is best tuna
technology,not_removed,theyve submitted another agreement since then these things take a while
technology,not_removed,explain please
technology,not_removed,thats called fraud congrats
technology,not_removed,join islamic state in syria
technology,not_removed,if its europe then youre misinformed you guys dont even have the right to free speech and could get arrested for hate speech which basically means insulting someone this is including canada
technology,not_removed,relying on paypal for that was a mistake i mean beyond that thats absolutely critical infrastructure so you pick a payment processing vendor with support
technology,not_removed,i dont believe age has anything to do with knowing names of conventions under duress anyways with such a low entrance fee paypal would take most of that in fees due to their flat cents per transaction unless you chose their micro transaction option may as well ask for cash at that point
technology,not_removed,that escalated quickly
technology,not_removed,im not sure if this is a joke or not but it seems pretty insane to tell people they cant sell something they legally acquired and own
technology,not_removed,i dont know if thats actually legal havent similar tricks been deemed illegal like people trying to get around having no liquor license by selling styrofoam cups for and including the liquor beverage for free with the cup
technology,not_removed,laws are so fucking arbitrary and stupid you cant make money you can still use the resources you just cant live off of these resources i mean honestly wtf is the difference in saying ill sell you the lure and the fish is free vs ill sell you the fish and the lure is free no fucking difference
technology,not_removed,lol you actually have to send the necklace thats the whole point
technology,not_removed,that was my thinking at the time i sold as login key and described the character after discussions with others who had previously sold theirs just fine there were dozens for sale at the same time using the same format but im certain a ultra rare sword i had obtained identified me and somebody in a rival linkshellguild probably reported it i had no intention of lying or being on the hook for any physical item i was done with the game anyways so worst that couldve happened was se deleting my toon and i was prepared for that
technology,not_removed,i wish i could get my old character back i feel like the amount of server space it would require to keep every character ever made on hand indefinitely would be negligible but what do i know
technology,not_removed,how do you sign up for class action lawsuits
technology,not_removed,i actually got like from the lcd class action lawsuit because id bought like different affected items that was kinda nice
technology,not_removed,welcome to class action lawsuits the only real winners in these are the lawyers well the point of class actions are more to punish the company than to repay the wronged
technology,not_removed,this case is extreme though they are taking much more than most with similar size classes and settlements
technology,not_removed,you cant just sign away rights no sane judge would honor that the supreme court has upheld the signing away of all future rights to jury trial as guaranteed under the constitutional in those arbitration agreements now demanded by so many companies
technology,not_removed,mind sharing where you read the info thanks
technology,not_removed,walmart possibly had a purchasing record for him if a debit or credit card was used walmart was probably instructed to send a settlement check to everyone in their database whoever signs up with proof of purchase from the flyer they hide in the store
technology,not_removed,or walmart has his customer information on record if a credit card was used and was instructed to pay any customer it had record of the class action signups
technology,not_removed,thats more like die part
technology,not_removed,there was a movie called die hard which had a bunch of sequels which progressive got worse and worse one of which was live free or die hard
technology,not_removed,id take that compromise for their transportation infrastructure and healthcare i havent used hate speech in decades never would again
technology,not_removed,true but that was also back in many lessons have been learned since
technology,not_removed,i wasnt ready
technology,not_removed,that mescalated quickly
technology,not_removed,you could say it broke bad quickly
technology,not_removed,gotta keep the competition out yo
technology,not_removed,no theres a lot of laws now well starting around especially in california and nevada you can thank oj simpson literally take a gander down that rabbit hole no joke
technology,not_removed,what usually happens is some influential person either gets screwed and demands a law be made because of their own stupidity or sees money to be made and demands a law be made so they can get a cut and pushes for a rider low key law that gets approved because politicians trust lobbyists
technology,not_removed,there was a hooters in my city that was denied a liquor license due to a vocal church group for almost years they gave away free beer with food purchase what is the difference between that or giving away free beer with a cup purchase
technology,not_removed,it might not be but the liquor idea sounds like a good one haha
technology,not_removed,its legal welcome to law loopholes wording are everything
technology,not_removed,how about hillary giving speeches for perfectly legal right
technology,not_removed,gotta love grey areas
technology,not_removed,i think they want you to pay for a commercial fishing licensethen you could probably sell the fish
technology,not_removed,hate to break it to you but they recently shut the servers down for good iirc
technology,not_removed,they are aware that its breaking the tos he doesnt need a wow pretend lawyer to tell him that
technology,not_removed,you still own the intellectual property that is the username and password if that account is seen to break terms of service thats neither here nor there on the legality of selling the account
technology,not_removed,for wow its not nontransferable its limitedtransferable there are some circumstances you can transfer ownership and theyre listed in the tos most of them involve family circumstances selling is against the tos though
technology,not_removed,httpwwwclassactionrebatescom
technology,not_removed,nope says it right in the settlement agreement document that the attorneys are taking which is perfectly normal for this sort of issue
technology,not_removed,what i have seen is most of these agreements say you must go to arbitration before you can go to litigation you can still litigate the thing is arbitration takes time usually the company hopes you take the arbitration deal to avoid the extra time costs of litigation you usually still get a payout they do not risk having a judgement set precedent for others you can elect to not take the arbitration decision an arbitrator is not a judge and their resolution is not legally binding if you or the company choose not to accept of course then youre looking at a long costly battle
technology,not_removed,many arbitration clauses can be opted out of per state law just gotta read the tos
technology,not_removed,consumerist is usually pretty legit
technology,not_removed,but why did having a prepaid cell phone matter gets refund
technology,not_removed,neither was he
technology,not_removed,mescaline no meth methscalated 😎
technology,not_removed,methcalated
technology,not_removed,no detective i dont sell cocaine i sell luggage and the contents are free fucking stupid
technology,not_removed,pretty sure my character has been toast since like anyway hadnt played since around when rusty caps got nerfed but yeah that is a little sad off topic and anecdotally i had bought the whole preorder collectors edition for xiii right the next mmo and it was so terribly shitty i threw everything away then i guess they fixed it years later and made it better and its not bad anymore
technology,not_removed,under what lawregulation would a username and password be considered intellectual property
technology,not_removed,at issue is the fact that they agreed to settle so low payouts really
technology,not_removed,meanwhile i live in a country where contradicting the consumer laws is an offence itself and earned companies like apple millions in fines
technology,not_removed,which states why would tos have anything to do with state law
technology,not_removed,its the only way to fly
technology,not_removed,the problem is cocaine is illegal to possess without proper medical paperwork
technology,not_removed,xiv is the online one it looks great and its still a growing user base ive yet to play myself as ive been worried id be way too late to the game but from what ive been reading on their reddit has me wanting to give it a try the new xv is coming though too so theres lots to do
technology,not_removed,well thats actually a separate issue of the settlement is pretty standard and a settlement is also common in a large class action suit those small payments are an acknowledgement that paypal kept some people away from their money when they shouldnt have for most people this caused little harm for people that suffered greater harms couldnt pay their rent got evicted etc well those people have a right to opt out of the class and sue paypal separately i know it all my seem extreme but for a consumer type class action suit this whole thing is quite typical
technology,not_removed,gets complicated and a tos is meaningless if a court tosses provisions that are unenforcable or unapplicable later for example in that article it states that many arbitration costs are so high that it doesnt give either party the ability to fairly resolve differences including the one asking for arbitration another aspect of all this is nobody really knows what is enforcable versus not in tos it costs so much money to test the waters that it hasnt gotten high enough in the courts to say one way or another most of what we see is settlement because its so much cheaper for all parties involved
technology,not_removed,because the companies are doing whatever they can to make sure that they can fuck you and you cant do shit about it
technology,not_removed,its a mystery prize
technology,not_removed,problem is you dont even need to know you are possessing it possession is the crime
technology,not_removed,the prepatch is already live with a slew of new bugs they probably started the hire influx a month or two ago
technology,not_removed,just let google do the work of patent research dump touchwiz and dont mess with the great android they make and deliver that to your customers but no samsung needs to differentiate their software from others does not matter that is costs millions in lawsuits and customers get a laggy device
technology,not_removed,yea if you run a program specifically designed to stress the cpu without actually doing anything worth while and just sit there stupid
technology,not_removed,about as silly as not putting heatsinks on parts known to be getting close to their thermal limits and a program known to be used as a power draw test and stability test by users
technology,not_removed,the key word is test it is meant to be run for a short time when you get to be my age they make you take a stress test to see how your heart is doing they dont however expect you to stay on the treadmill all day
technology,not_removed,no but if you are looking at a peak performer athelete they might expect you to stay on the treadmill a bit longer and perform a bit harder than others having this happen is a bit of a problem because according to a fair few people its not just happening in furmark in some casees sub mins either but shadow warrior and other games
technology,not_removed,i would say no unless he already had something installed to do just this

technology,not_removed,no real surprise here newegg has been fighting off patent trolls for a while most on stupid non descript things that are to vague to be nailed down
technology,not_removed,some patents are bullshit granting patents to overly simple ideas is just absurd
technology,not_removed,and why exactly does that little courthouse in east texas that handles of the countries patent cases and sets its own rules and is run by retired judges that consider themselves overlords continue to run in a way that favors plaintiffs and opens the door for mass exploitation on an economyinnovation disrupting level seems like a lot of people are wasting a lot of money and a lot of politicians are wasting a lot of time and tax dollars to reform the unnecessary when that little courthouse and overlord judges seem like one of the biggest leaks in the process by a long shot
technology,not_removed,holy shit when i saw it was one hour i almost didnt watch then i decided to see a little bit i ended up watching the whole thing the guy is a great speaker and great story teller the story itself is informative and interesting too
technology,not_removed,here on the internet you can just say bullshit
technology,not_removed,so are trade secrets
technology,not_removed,some patents protect real nonobvious inventions some patents are on totally obvious concepts even though patent law requires patents to be nonobvious to a competent practitioner in the field i wonder how the bad ones got issued
technology,not_removed,read that as parents are bullshit was wondering why newegg was being so angsty
technology,not_removed,software patents are bullshit ftfy there are some patents that are still useful but software especially software infrastructure patents should have never been allowed
technology,not_removed,depends on the patent some are legit but thinngs likes apple patenting a rectangular phone is bullshit
technology,not_removed,misleading title tag needed disclaimer didnt watch the video because its fucking minutes long but did read the entire article never once does it even mention the statement patents are bullshit and thats not the tone the article sets anyways the tone is more like patent trolls are bullshit unless the video is vastly different from the article the misleading title tag is still needed
technology,not_removed,simple fix make patents nontransferable and not assignable to corporate entities but only people
technology,not_removed,patent trolls and patent exploitation are bullshit patents and copyrights are necessary it sounds so dreamy free knowledge free designs free formulas for everyone no ownership of ideas or discoveries they belong to all mankind but it takes a lot of blood sweat and tears to innovate and create and it costs money it isnt easy why would an individual or a company take risks spend money spend man hours to develop something that could easily and legally be coldmacked right away they wouldnt at least not nearly as much as they do when there exists a carrot a chance to have the risk and effort rewarded so wed not have the lifesaving medicines the ipods even the art that we do so many of the things that we know and love and depend on simply would not exist development of new things we would know and love and depend on in the future would stagnate a patentfree world would be a greater inhibitor of progress than the system we have today despite its flaws
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,ive been thoroughly disappointed with newegg over the years guess they went public a while ago but i really respect their commitment to standing up against patent trolls
technology,not_removed,some patents are bs however for the little inventor who creates things patents are extremely necessary but prohibitively expensove ways to have a chance to keep your invention stolen by a big business patents should be like copyright for songs nearly free and automatic when filed then you would have lot more good patents filed by small inventors and a fast marketplace of ideas and quick innovations in the world now big companies are the only ones who can afford to file patents so only blocking patents are used wth if you hate patents do you also think song writers shouldnt have copyright protection because its the same thing or is an idiot with a sample mixer more entitled to protection than an engineer or genius patents are one of the few legal ideas actually conceived in the constitution itself
technology,not_removed,im glad to see that ars is there to protect us from the word bullshit that i cant seem to find noted in the article
technology,not_removed,whats a bullst
technology,not_removed,i like newegg even more now
technology,not_removed,patents are are actually very useful but they badly need reform
technology,not_removed,i thought the video was interesting long but interesting
technology,not_removed,i have a tremendous number of very good innovations sitting on a shelf because patents are each minimum and i am sorry but i wont let my hard work be used for free so i have to wait to fund the patents if you want to see innovation be as rapid as a next top playlist change over then allow me to patent all my innovations in one filing for like i can get copyright protection for ten songs or ten books in one filing and make approval automatic and instant like with copyright and instantly publicise the work songs are worth millions and arguably easier to create and less helpful to mankind than a good patent so why should a songwirter have instant copyright protection without filing anything and be able to get officially registered copyright protection for multiple songs for a hundred bucks when a patent costs just to file and both end up getting the money matters and priority settled in court anyway so actual originality rarely matters anyway so why not make patent approval automatic like copyright protection if you allowed cheap automatic patent protection you would see amazing developments that would drastically improve your life happen in tje first year you would have less lawsuits because a private srttlement and judging system would quickly evolve to rank originality of ideas automatically for settlement by lawyers just like most song and script copyright originality issues are handled today
technology,not_removed,i thought this said parents are bullshit and i wondered why lee cheng had such a strong opinion on it
technology,not_removed,patents and copyright both are bullshit theyre progresshostile things created solely to guarantee money changes hands in our otherwise also peoplehostile competition based dystopia and in that sense theyre both symptoms of a much larger malaise rather than primary problems which is also true of almost everything else thats objectionable in society
technology,not_removed,ideally an invention should benefit all of humanity not just the person who invented it in the long wrong its incredibly selfish and i understand how our current societies are built in that money is quite useful but think of the long term which a lot of people have difficulty imagining things outside their own lifespan if you invent a robot that can operate transporting you just knocked out the transportation industry in one fell swoop now billion people wont have to work except that we designed our lives to require a job screw the fact that weve just improved humanities very existence making travel safer faster and affordable for everybody inventions should progress humanity yet they are now holding us back more than ever before fuck patents humans only got this far by working together
technology,not_removed,people dont have balls anymore while i am not a fan of violence and intimidation if someone was threatening my livelihood i would respond with excess force a bully will usually back down when he gets bullied back i mean real violent force
technology,not_removed,says the chinese guy
technology,not_removed,hes right the uspto in its current form is the biggest obstacle to innovation in us economic history
technology,not_removed,gosh i hate patents why cant i act upon an idea just because someone did it before me its rediculous
technology,not_removed,given the shit direction newegg has been going comments like this from a buckethead arent surprising
technology,not_removed,because fuck entrepreneurs you idiots fighting patents think you are being progressive but really you are fighting against technological progress by ensuring that only those with wealth are able to actually create new technology and profit from it
technology,not_removed,like the guy who patented digital shopping carts the patent was for any kind of digital system that would save selections for you to pay for later
technology,not_removed,thanks ignorant congress
technology,not_removed,patent law requires the invention to be nonobvious to a skilled practitioner in the field somehow the law isnt being applied
technology,not_removed,so i have a question i am not well versed in patent law however doesnt the idea or invention in question have to be specific and innovative to get awarded the patent how to trolls even get these patents passed in the first place
technology,not_removed,the patent system no longer supports its premise for creation it should be abolished as it actively works against the sciences rather than for them
technology,not_removed,i have heard good arguments that all patents are crap they slow down innovation and they dont really affect profits if you are first to market
technology,not_removed,but my rectangle with rounded corners is my thing
technology,not_removed,ok this is what i read about startup invents a new drug overloard drug company comes and sues them for patent infrigment and they have to stop selling the drug after a few years it does not matter if the startup wins in courts do you realy belive that the system is not rigged for the big guys and is it realy so suprising when the politicans dependent more on the money of the big industrys than on the people that you get laws that protect those industrys and not the people in the us you can even vote with money does this not mean that corruption is legal
technology,not_removed,patents just dont understand
technology,not_removed,i read it as parents too and was really confused as to why neweggs legal department was taking such an odd stance
technology,not_removed,god its not a phase mom i identify as a computer
technology,not_removed,thats just a complete double standard
technology,not_removed,not always some software requires serious rd not talking about shitty ui patents or well known business process but on a computer here especially around say database indexing xml parsers rendering we occasionally get actual innovation
technology,not_removed,he said it in the video within the first mins
technology,not_removed,the video stated that most patents are bs as they do nothing to benefit society and of submitted are granted
technology,not_removed,did you read the title of the article
technology,not_removed,false dmca claims and patent trolls on one end of the spectrum and wickedness like ostracizing via falseaccusations on the other end you cant assume anything you cant deny justice on a whim either the system is saturated and ddosed to no end but theres nothing anyone canshould do about it i recognize this situation as a way to garner support for changing it into something far more horrifying seems to be the only footinthedoor tactic the left has anymore
technology,not_removed,corporations are people
technology,not_removed,patents are different than an exclusive regulatory approval only the patent office issues patents only the fda grants food and drug and health device approvals
technology,not_removed,i immediately assumed itd be about parents constantly returning pcs they bought for their kids because they cant play minecraft or rocket league
technology,not_removed,copyrights fine it just goes on too long consider what if you wrote the next great novel a game of thrones or harry potter without copyright penguin could copy your book sell it themselves put more marketing money behind it and bury you as a tiny irrelevancy before the juggernaut they create copyright is absolutely necessary a copyright term of years is not
technology,not_removed,patents can also be a engine for innovation lets use nokia as a example they spent billion dollars every year for a decade on one of the worlds most expensive rd industries to bring gsm edge lte ceramic antennas and so on to the world actual network hardware and software that has influenced all of our life greatly even so nokias network profit for such a huge rd investment are around million to billion annually without patents theres just no way such a huge investments example on semiconductors or network manufacturers side would ever be made for hardware their exante costs are astronomical and the little return really comes from the timed protection given by patents
technology,not_removed,removing patents would ensure that only those with wealth and power are able to create new technology and profit
technology,not_removed,well im not a pussy like you i love all violence and if someone looked at me wrong id have sex with their family dog and then not call her back for a second date
technology,not_removed,says the butthurt racist
technology,not_removed,fuck you we are proudly american because in this great country anyone from around the world can be american lee cheng
technology,not_removed,newegg has been a champion fighting patent trolls also that title is weapons grade bolognium
technology,not_removed,one of us is uninformed congress doesnt approve patents so what are you talking about
technology,not_removed,yes probably an underfunded patent office patent laws usually require that for an invention to be patentable it must be patentable subject matter ie a kind of subjectmatter eligible for patent protection novel ie at least some aspect of it must be new nonobvious in united states patent law or involve an inventive step in european patent law useful in us patent law or be susceptible of industrial application in european patent law httpsenwikipediaorgwikipatentability
technology,not_removed,rubber stamp they approver retardedly obvious patents often on things that already exist newegg crushed a company that patented the digital shopping cart that has already existed for a while
technology,not_removed,basically there arent many patent offices and there are more patents coming through than the people working there can handle the clerks cant be expected to be knowledgeable about everything coming through its just too much they end up approving most things and let the courts sort out what is and is not right later
technology,not_removed,specific no it just has to be patentable subject matter new and inventive not narrow and specific a very broad patent to a whole new legit technology is sometimes referred to as a pioneer patent the patent on the first lightbulb or transistor for example is the patent on the first online shopping cart a pioneer patent i guess if the patent is valid in other respects thats a big if though
technology,not_removed,do you think the people approving these patents are experts in the related field why would such an expert spend their time reading patents when they could apply their knowledge for much better pay
technology,not_removed,the patent system was created to solve real problems and abolishing it will simply bring those problems back it should however be extensively reworked or replaced software patents should definitely go
technology,not_removed,it stifles innovation and contributes to the divide of rich and poor we all end up paying more for things and the rich get richer and the poor and middle class are worse off our governments are working against the publics interests by enforcing and extending patents and copyrights like how mickey mouse never goes into public domain if disney has anything to say about it for the rich few who own them
technology,not_removed,patent is pro innovation and science actually it enables companies to invest billions in research knowing they can protect their inventions
technology,not_removed,how so patent law has explicit exceptions for rd you can research patented tech and improve on it as much as you like
technology,not_removed,they probably do slow down innovation but if they didnt affect profits why would companies spend so much on acquiring and defending them in the first place
technology,not_removed,the good thing about patents is that people share their innovations instead of keeping them secret
technology,not_removed,apple has no patent for a rectangle with rounded corners they have a patent on the look of the ipad which includes the fact that it has rounded corners its like copyright i hold copyright over this comment but i do not hold any rights over any particular word within it i own the whole not the parts
technology,not_removed,reading this comment gave me brain cancer
technology,not_removed,disclaimer didnt watch the video did you even read my comment
technology,not_removed,have you ever gone through the patent process no of patents are not submitted and granted right away im going through that process right now actually along every step the lawyer says ok only of people that reach this step move on to the next do you still want to proceed and thats along every step so of of equalsnext to nothing maybe the lawyer is exaggerating but hes not exaggerating that much and i know other people who actually have a patent all have said basically the same thing patent trolls are of course a huge problem but as someone seeking a patent they are not unbeneficial fighting china for stealing one of your patents is a dead end if youre a small company but i absolutely intend to protect the original ideas that ive come up with and i fully intent to legally prosecute if i have to in the future once i obtain my patent
technology,not_removed,thats pretty true but the vast majority of patents are never used to sue or threaten someone so a stupid patent isnt really a dangerous one
technology,not_removed,fuck citizens united no they are not they are comprised of people
technology,not_removed,just how many expenditures can you or the majority of americans afford in a month and since when did how much work you put into it have anything to do with the importance of a new idea and why should a song get more protection cheaper and easier than another idea edit as an independent inventor let me tell you how real inventors work having met many of the most important and least important at inventors conferences over many years a real inventor is like a song writer the ideas pop into their heads all the time they actually make connections between technologies other dont make its like the best songwriters have songs melodies or lyrics pop into their heads all the time it doesnt take a lot of work and the best and most impactful ideas are often the simplest the people responsible for most inventions are extremely prolific think tesla without jpmorgan to pay for his patent filings they have hundreds or thousands of ideas tucked away they cant release or afford to get patented i am talking very very important innovations that would really change your life for the better ideas in medicine and play cars and cats i am not talking about corporate inventions which typically are marginal improvements not breakthroughs and the current patent record doesnt reflect this because the costly patents mean marginal corporate patents are the majority of filed patents the big independent breakthroughs remain in drawers and die with the independent inventors amd remember most people who have an main interest in science or engineering or imagineering rarely also have an interest in business exploitation in fact typically most inventors donct value money much but value discovery greatly so the end result is we as a society live a life that is much worse than it would be if we simply had a patent system that was free and instant and then let the market decide what the value of that patent would be
technology,not_removed,agreed and without copyright i could modify the novel and resell it as my own with or without attribution or otherwise torture the image of a work of art without legal repercussions protection of profit is a sliver the idea that worktorture can still occur a millennia from now might be the reason for the seemingly excessively long terms
technology,not_removed,glad to hear the title is nonsense still think newegg is plummeting
technology,not_removed,they could reform the patent system though
technology,not_removed,i think its you
technology,not_removed,yes one of you is uninformed if only there were some nonpatented universal way to look things up regarding the topic everyone was talking about
technology,not_removed,seems like a system of some sort to check applications would be beneficial
technology,not_removed,thanks for the explanation
technology,not_removed,true but then the question needs to be asked if they are not experts why are they reviewing patents
technology,not_removed,people always want to throw the baby out with the water
technology,not_removed,why should software patents go its not particularly easy to get a software patent as it is
technology,not_removed,the patent system was created to allow ideas to create revenue for a limited time and to grant the originator the honors of such a deed it no longer applies people invent under a corporation and the pantents are trolled by changing one thing and repatenting over and over when the express purpose was to expire so that all of mankind could benefit
technology,not_removed,i feel like the xkdc comic standards could still apply here
technology,not_removed,for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear simple and wrong one of societys enduring flaws is that attempting to fix a problem is viewed as always better than not without accounting for the costs of the proposed solution
technology,not_removed,what real problems would we expect to return i can only imagine the argument without the ability to recoup their investment there will be no invective for innovation which i do not see as a problem
technology,not_removed,what problems did it solve i thought the idea was to encourage innovation by allowing innovators a time limited monopoly on their invention withouts patent the two options are keep it secret or keep innovating the keep it secret thing doesnt always work of course since some things can be very easily reverse engineered is there something else it might hoping to fix
technology,not_removed,which problems did it solve
technology,not_removed,what the fuck are you on the patent system was created to solve real problems and abolishing it will simply bring those problems back no it wasnt it was a bargain that was struck between inventors and the public the idea was that if inventors would disclose how they made something they would be granted a monopoly on it for a certain period of time the public would benefit because eventually anyone would be able to produce it it was also believed that it would incentivize more inventions in short it was a bargain that benefited inventors by granting them a monopoly on their ideas for a set period of time and the public by getting them more inventions however most studies done over the past couple of decades seem to indicate that the patent system is no longer serving the public interest if its not there is absolutely no reason to maintain the bargain
technology,not_removed,no the patent system was created under false pretenses to give gov protection to certain people so they could abuse consumers every market where it is not possible to patent fashion fe sees more development and progress than markets were you can use patents
technology,not_removed,yeah and all software should be free and open source right fuck off
technology,not_removed,which of those problems would be better solved by refactoring it
technology,not_removed,the modern patent system was invented to give kickbacks to people in the crowns favor the federal reserve bank of st louis wrote a great paper on why the patent system has never and will never work
technology,not_removed,with base tech patented your results of your research wont see light of the day no one other than original patent holder can make use of it everyone must line up to license the original patent patents in digital land grab willingness of entities to draw a boundary around arbitrary digital land and stop anyone from building the same land in their digital world patents is a way to coopt the power of american people for your personal benefit the way walmart externalizes the cost of providing medical benefits to employees by asking them to use medicaid the patent holders use law enforcement judiciary and fbicia as their agents to enforce patents if patent violators are expected to research every patent that applies to them and license it then patent owners must be held to the same if a patent gets invalidated the entity filing the patent should face fines including and not limited to any license fees any legal fees and and lost business if one is saying i am first here and hence entitled to this land then they must be held to higher standard there should be a payoff to anyone doing a patent invalidation eg if a patent is invalidated then entity showing prior art would get of all license fees collected by the from patent owner coming out of patent owners pockets let there be startups that do nothing but invalidate patents making their millions lets see how many patent holders then withdrew their patents voluntarily today there is no cost to making false knowledgeterritory claims in fact patent office has now changed laws that awards patent to first person to file an idea with patent office prior art conditionals do not apply anymore if you are first to tell patent office about wheel you can patent a wheel this has to be reversed
technology,not_removed,probably the same concept as smoking ads ban with the patent system in place you are in a position where you have to acquire your patent and if you dont defend it you are in a worse position than others who do defend theirs and use yours too they would get a bigger market share by using your patents or more likely something really similar to what you have patented so all companies are in a tugofwar the same was said about cigarette ads companies had to invest very much money into cigarette ads because other companies were advertising their brand banning cigarette ads made cigarette companies not have to worry about pumping more and more money into ads on tv radio billboards etc and the market share wasnt affected by ads from other companies oversimplified of course im not going deep into the loopholes and circumvention tactics
technology,not_removed,they probably do slow down innovation this is highly dependent on the field in some sectors patents turbocharge innovation because when someone has a patent on a particular mechanism or thing all their competitors try to figure out how to get the same or better results in a different way instead of just doing the same thing a good example of this happening is with copy machines xerox patented using selenium as a lightsensitive element so others did research and figured out how to use an organic photoconductive material instead which turned out to be much much better than selenium personally i think the issue is patents which are written to claim every single way of getting a result which is particularly problematic in anything computerrelated
technology,not_removed,and even this is not entirely true what youre talking about is what is called in the us a design patent which is called a registered design in the uk and entirely a different thing to a patent patents protect how things work designs protect how they look apple do not have a patent for rounded corners
technology,not_removed,maybe not apple but im pretty sure microsoft patented the squircle when they released the generation of zunes
technology,not_removed,reading your comment made me sad
technology,not_removed,theres a treatment for that but the patent holder has a monopoly on it and recently raised the price by
technology,not_removed,yeah but you asserted that he didnt say patents are bullshit and he did so you bitching at the other guy about not reading your comment is an ironic equivalent to the very thing he accused you of
technology,not_removed,no i didnt how does it feel now
technology,not_removed,patent allowance rates vary greatly depending on the subject area im an examiner and i have friends in other areas whose allowance rates are as low as and as high as and even if you had a allowance rate very few of them are first action allowances and even fewer are allowable right away without the examiner taking the initiative to find and propose amendments to the claims
technology,not_removed,there are real patents and patent trolls
technology,not_removed,id edit that to isnt necessarily a dangerous one
technology,not_removed,yes but the rules for parents arent all that bad they are just being applied poorly imo
technology,not_removed,if you are implying i should have googled something im not even sure what i should be looking up was there a specific event recently
technology,not_removed,why would such an expert spend their time reading patents when they could apply their knowledge for much better pay thats why
technology,not_removed,patently absurd
technology,not_removed,youll be able to afford new patentleather shoes
technology,not_removed,you laught but
technology,not_removed,its possible the baby isnt worth the bath water
technology,not_removed,prior to patents inventions were protected by keeping them secret this is how we lost the technology behind greek fire the iron pillar of delhi the antikythera mechanism roman concrete stradivarius violins bagdad batteries everything davinci damascus steel steam and so on patents fixed this by legally permitting a limited exclusivity in exchange for the details of the invention to be recorded and stored and of course patents also protect httpsenwikipediaorgwikirobertkearns he added engineering flaws to his designs as a form of copyright protection the engineering skill of the rest of the world has since caught up but at the time it was effective the romans had steam power back in the approximate time of jesus it was lost when rome fell
technology,not_removed,because the vast majority of software patents are for things that already have real world equivalents but on a computer its not a new novel idea its just the ability to implement it in a computer system
technology,not_removed,because software is copyrighted also its not easy to get a software patent currently because youre not supposed to be allowed to on june the united states supreme court ruled in alice corp v cls bank international that merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform abstract idea into a patenteligible invention httpsenwikipediaorgwikisoftwarepatentsunderunitedstatespatentlaw
technology,not_removed,because all software is just a mathematical algorithm it would be like patenting
technology,not_removed,the patent system was created to allow ideas to create revenue for a limited time and to grant the originator the honors of such a deed and also to document the invention and store it securely so it will not be lost and giving us a public domain of technological advancements that we can view learn from and improve after all edisons first patent was for improvements to electric lamps he built on what had come before and he did so because there were patents to guide him
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,the main problem patents were meant to solve was to create a documentary trail of technology for anyone to access and to end the secretive habits that lost us the secrets of greek fire the iron pillar of delhi the antikythera mechanism roman concrete stradivarius violins bagdad batteries everything davinci invented damascus steel and steam power edisons first patent was for improvements to electric lamps he built on what had come before and he did so because there were patents he could view to learn from and guide him
technology,not_removed,im not entirely convinced that secrecy would cause such a problem now that we have it information dissemination and storage capability is excellent currently
technology,not_removed,ive answered that elsewhere in this thread
technology,not_removed,what the fuck are you on caffeine no it wasnt yes it was prior to patents the only way to protect inventions was to keep how they are made secret there is still no legal protection on recipes which is why coke and kfc guard their recipes jealously and why we even have a phrase secret sauce and if you keep something secret then there is the potential it will be lost this is the main problem patents were meant to solve a documentary trail of technology for anyone to access and an end to the habits that lost us the secrets of greek fire the iron pillar of delhi the antikythera mechanism roman concrete stradivarius violins bagdad batteries everything davinci invented damascus steel and steam power we have since rediscovered many of those technologies but there are still a good few we havent they are lost for all time because no one wrote them down and stored them securely as the patent office does today
technology,not_removed,america used to have no respect for it either things change
technology,not_removed,wow you have an incredibly cynical view of the actions of well the founding fathers basically this was just one year after the signing of the constitution and the patent act was made into law by the very first government of the united states i think im going to have to insist on a source for that one
technology,not_removed,yeah and all software should be free and open source right heavens no why would i want that i write software fuck off charmed im sure
technology,not_removed,none refactoring is not to improve the solutions to the original problems refactoring is to remove the problems that have been introduced since
technology,not_removed,the patent act was in its own words an act to promote the progress of useful arts
technology,not_removed,i think the issue is patents which are written to claim every single way of getting a result yeah that simply shouldnt be allowed you shouldnt be able to patent a result only a particular implementation
technology,not_removed,no i didnt i blatantly disclaimed that i didnt watch the video and i specified that the statement patents are bullshit doesnt appear in the article and regardless of that fact alone that statement by itself is misleading and doesnt appropriate the tone for the article lastly my comment would take all of what seconds to read sorry if i dont feel like spending a full hour of free time watching a long video about fucking patents of all things especially when theres an article right below it thats supposed to summarize the material minutes vs minutes i chose the abbreviated version and stated accordingly
technology,not_removed,what point are you trying to make
technology,not_removed,thank you for your insight
technology,not_removed,ideas are worthless no they are worth billions everyone has hundreds of them actually most people dont i wrote down three this week including a new unlimited flight time drone idea a self assembling super capaictor a new helicopter blade arrangement a toy to helps elderly arm strength a plasma fusor improvement oops thats mreo than three this weekhow many have you had the value is on the execution nope others can execute after they pay for the license fee thats the way most patents payoff also you cant patent ideas afaik nope you have to develop something on it dont even know what that means copyright at least doesnt cause as much damage than patents the vast majority of patents create great benefit your cellphone exists becuase of hundreds of patents by inventors all of which are compensated yet you can still get a nearly free smart phone you only remember the bad patents that got talked up as trolling by some big business lobbyists thatant to use otherpeoples ideas without paying them they would be ok reduced to something like years no because it takes that long just to get scaledmanufacturing into place after and an improvement is recognozed and adopted by industry but a declining license fee is usually negotiate making term of the patent relatively irrelevant and new tech replades old bwfore years anyway there are many songs that have severely damaged the world anything by ladygaga for example korn justin beiber
technology,not_removed,if they can be applied poorly they are bad
technology,not_removed,ok fair point but that only explains why experts dont do it not why everyone is ok with uninformed people doing it
technology,not_removed,i patented that phrase im suing you
technology,not_removed,i dont think thats ever been true in the literal sense
technology,not_removed,wasnt roman steam power mostly used for fancy party trick type machines i read somewhere that while they had steam power the couldnt make boilers that could generate enough pressuresteamwhat have you to do much more than power novelty machines
technology,not_removed,i just for fun read through a handful of the thousands of new patents that get made each month what a cluster fuck it would take an obscene amount of money to even start to get a handle on what im allowed to make and if i get it wrong i lose everything why even bother edit after reading some more these are so highly technical that i doubt most of these could even begin to be replicated from the description given so whats the point
technology,not_removed,that is quite the stretch to say we lost those things that were invented before the printing press because there were no patents was the printing press patented what have we lost since that particular invention
technology,not_removed,i would rather have them kept secret at least then i couldnt be sued if i happened to have the same idea
technology,not_removed,thats exactly what alice says you cant do so we agree there what about the rest of them
technology,not_removed,that only means that a lot of shitty software patents have been granted not that software patents should be abolished
technology,not_removed,copyright extends only to the code itself really the patent protects more than that im aware of alice but that doesnt say you arent meant to be able to patent software only that the the mere use of a computer doesnt render something patentable however if software makes a computer more efficient regardless of whatever process is executing on that computer why shouldnt that be patentable
technology,not_removed,bit more to it than that
technology,not_removed,secrecy is like privacy its not necessarily always a bad thing and strongly relates to the whole privacy is the basis of a free society thing and you cant have privacy without secrecy because secrecy is crucial for symmetric encryption i keep hearing that quantum computing that will end asynchronous encryption is just around the corner so
technology,not_removed,so that function would be for those things which arent easily reverse engineered and where there isnt other incentive to document and share possibly though it is moot because eventually a better concreteviolinbatterysteel etc will be created im not sure how long you can rest on your laurels in these modern times of internet smart phone apps
technology,not_removed,where
technology,not_removed,there is lots of discussion and articles of each side of the debate on why patents hinder or help development if you are interested in the subject this is a good nonacademic peak into some of the antipatent ideas if you want academic sources youll have no problem searching for them
technology,not_removed,i see you have been commenting on rapple a lot you realise that all their software is closed source
technology,not_removed,im not trying to argue semantics here but if the system has failed then the initial design was incorrect it was not resilient to unforeseen problems but yea perhaps not the right word
technology,not_removed,and the patriot act was enacted to protect american freedoms whats your point
technology,not_removed,you implied that the title is misleading and should be tagged as such because the guy never says patents are bullshit he said so in the video just because you clarified that you didnt watch the video doesnt change the fact that your assertion that the title is misleading is completely wrong and i specified that the statement patents are bullshit doesnt appear in the article but it appears in the video which is embedded in the link op provided so why would articles title be misleading its not you just didnt want to watch the video understandably and because that phrase didnt show up in the article you jumped the gun on calling it misleading and now youre just what backpedaling to save face you were wrong its fine this shit happens but arguing about it just makes you look really petty
technology,not_removed,its too late the damage is done all of us have already torrented the phrase
technology,not_removed,cannot patent a phrase at best you could copyright it but the shorter an expression is the less likely copyright protection would hold your best bet would be to trademark or service mark it pedantry but it always annoys me when others make this mistake and they are not making a joke
technology,not_removed,i dont think the aphorism has ever been meant in the literal sense
technology,not_removed,i very carefully did not say steam engines p it blows my mind actually that if the romans werent so decadent and had just a little spark of necessity that is the mother of invention then the industrial revolution could have happened years early
technology,not_removed,to pay ip attorneys ungodly sums of money
technology,not_removed,stradivari violins the telharmonium and damascus steel were all lost after the invention of the printing press plus believe it or not some of the technology in the apollo mission
technology,not_removed,then we risk losing them they certainly can no longer be improved and built upon by others people cannot learn from them and take them further
technology,not_removed,what you cant do and what the patent office allows are two different things this is where the problem is
technology,not_removed,the problem is the system is so ripe for abuse that the mere existence of software patents has bad consequences no matter who you and how you have the system set up itll go to shit its like saying dictatorships and authoritarian governments are good ideas because you can just have benevolent dictators and governments in power
technology,not_removed,for the same reason books arent patented
technology,not_removed,please point out to me a single thing a computer does that is not a mathematical operation
technology,not_removed,software patents are a weird broken exception although they share the name they do not operate like normal patents its possible they can be fixed but by and large i agree and i support their abolition i dont think they have any redeeming value
technology,not_removed,secrecy is like privacy its not necessarily always a bad thing secrecy is still an option no one is forced to take out a patent
technology,not_removed,so that function would be for those things which arent easily reverse engineered nope learning from what has come before should be easy and should not require pulling something to pieces the patent office is a library of technology there to be read
technology,not_removed,agreed utmost regard for the privacy enabling ubiquitous use of encryption after asynchronous encryption such as standards based on elliptic curve are broken by quantum computers the only way to share the key for symmetric encryption will then have to be offline putting an end to over the air keying during handshake convenience that allows for the ubiquitous use of encryption everywhere without the hassle of physically sharing keys all the time
technology,not_removed,there is lots of discussion and articles of each side of the debate on why patents hinder or help development that is not what you said you said the patent system was created under false pretenses to give gov protection to certain people so they could abuse consumers that is what i want a source on demonstrate to me that the us government in created the patent system under false pretences as a consumer hostile move
technology,not_removed,sure oh except webkit but yeah apart from that oh and swift and the libraries but nothing else nope wait its all unix so that means the mach kernel and darwin too oh yes and researchkit and carekit and bonjour but thats basically nothing right ah except theres the compiler too llvm and the lossless audio format plus gcd their caldav implementation streaming server a bunch of file system tools macruby cups dcerpc xquartz barely anything really
technology,not_removed,im not trying to argue semantics here but if the system has failed then the initial design was incorrect not exactly the initial design has been altered patent laws have been twisted added to and expanded beyond their original scope honestly going back to the original patent laws is probably enough and would remove a great many problems its certainly a good starting place
technology,not_removed,no thats just random bullshit you made up on the fly in the vague hope that it might be true the actually states that its purpose was to deter and punish terrorist acts in the united states and around the world to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools and for other purposes in the entire text the word freedom is mentioned just twice once in reference to operation enduring freedom where it is used as a proper noun and once when it is stated that the attacks should be and are condemned by all americans who value freedom
technology,not_removed,do you understand the english language from my original post disclaimer didnt watch the video but did read the entire article never once does it even mention the statement patents are bullshit if you didnt understand that i meant never once in the article does it say then i dont know what to fucking tell you no im not backpedaling that was what i said from the very start
technology,not_removed,but the patent system requires the specification to be public
technology,not_removed,iirc the issue was more with the quality of their metals they couldnt make boilers that could withstand the pressure needed to actually do anything really useful not sure if a change in roman culture would have given light to the necessary metallurgical breakthroughs to spark an early industrial revolution
technology,not_removed,why would anyone build machines when you can just make slaves do the work machines can be better at specific tasks but slaves can do all kinds of things tons of slaves means labor cost is so low that theres no reason to invest in machines just get more slaves
technology,not_removed,telharmonium was patented im not sure it was lost either jusr no one was interested apollo technology well a patent system didnt help it seems your examples are few and mostly of craft more than technology i dont think you have a great case for saying a patent system is particularly responsible for preserving knowledge
technology,not_removed,there are many things that would be substantially improved by replacing some massive physical system with a computer and if doing so requires some novel work x but on a computer ought to be patentable otherwise it ought not be patentable i dont think thats really fundamentally different from patents on physical systems pharmaceutical companies successfully game ip protections by making slight tweaks like x but now extended release just to extend their exclusive rights i think that calls for reform in rules or enforcement thereof not abolishment
technology,not_removed,but the process of making a book like the machining process is patentable a cpu can be patented but not the microcode that is loaded into it
technology,not_removed,please point out a single thing a living organism does that isnt just the result of chemical reactions might be true on an incredibly base level but its not a helpful way of thinking about it id like to see quake broken down to just mathematical operations dont think its that simple
technology,not_removed,software patents should be gone they can protect their ip with copyright law and be a trade secret software patents are mainly used to stop competitors patents were never meant for ideas nobody would ever patent a molecule we havent isolated that kills bacteria you have to identify such molecule and prove that it kills bacteria
technology,not_removed,privacy and secrecy are separate related abstractions
technology,not_removed,without httpsenwikipediaorgwikiforwardsecrecy provided by httpsenwikipediaorgwikipublickeycryptography there is no possible chance of getting privacy a secure connection without physically sharing keys which is a pain in the asshole and will bring an end to ubiquitous easy to use private channels for communication the whole social privacy or whatever is just pure sophism bullshit meant to divert attention away from this fact confuse and frustrate people if in fact sufficiently developed quantum computing will be achieved then there will no longer be a way to easily create these private pipes this unyielding drive to unify these concepts andor deemphasize privacy is troubling and the comments in this thread about patents gave me a chilling because they involve misguided people trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater for that insane agenda some feel that the distinction between privacy and secrecy is how secrecy implies guilt which simply isnt true when youre talking about the ubiquitous interactions between people via the use of information technology you must have something to hide yeah right
technology,not_removed,pulling something to pieces is often easier than reading patent documents if you actually want to understand how it works
technology,not_removed,you are asking me to prove a social development not a chemistry test as you know social science can not offer the same level of proof than hard science that is why i pointed you to the academic discussions it is not like i can make a youtube video recording the test i did to prove a social event but you already know this and are looking to try to make a stupid point on the internet so next time take the valid answer and do not try to be a keyboard warrior
technology,not_removed,what about their operating systems you know that thing that generates revenue
technology,not_removed,if today it was reverted back to initial state why would the exact same scenario not play out to lead up back to where we are today except sped up times the government is incredibly corrupt there is no point in trying to fix the patent system it has failed its duty and its time is well past we live in a different era now one where reproducing can often be done on the order of days rather than monthsyears and the ease of international trade renders any benefit toward government protection essentially moot unless you are a large corp
technology,not_removed,nope thats not what you said all along maybe thats what you were implying but because of the way you chose to word it your implication wasnt clear at all again your fault its no elses fault that we cant read your mind to divine your meaning disclaimer didnt watch the video but did read the entire article never once does it even mention the statement patents are bullshit but the video did hence the articles title isnt misleading stop splitting hairs to save face now all youre accomplishing is sounding like a child stamping their feet with their fingers in their ears screaming no im not wrong and proving my point even further youre just acting petty because you were wrong and dont want to admit it
technology,not_removed,does it pharmaceuticals too
technology,not_removed,apollo technology well a patent system didnt help it seems it was the cold war patenting means publishing and publishing means the russians can get it spend two seconds to apply a little historical context huh your examples are few this isnt a scientific dissertation theres a limit to how much research im willing to do to satisfy a random redditor who is probably just going to reflexively doubt everything and provide no actual evidence in any kind of counterpoint i dont think you have a great case for saying a patent system is particularly responsible for preserving knowledge yeah well it beats the hell out of your case even a small amount of evidence beats random unsupported doubt
technology,not_removed,happysmash to whom i was replying said he would prefer the information to be kept secret by definition then the information is not on the internet
technology,not_removed,patents are for things that typically novel useful and nonobvious the vast majority of software patents are for neither novel or nonobvious ideas people just go for the patent on the implementation which is already covered by copyright which itself is broken but a whole different argument the argument has been made that patent system surrounding pharmaceuticals is also extremely flawed so its not really a good comparison
technology,not_removed,in laymens terms it must transform meaning its a legit software patent if it transforms a machine that can do physical things make tires into a machine that can do something patentable make hightemperature longlasting tires the software is running on a computer that controls the tiremaking machine if it just some code running on a computermachine physical device that doesnt transform that device into something notably different then you cant patent the software doing something on the computer is not patentable because the interpretation from alice states it must transform that computer from a general purpose computer into not a general purpose computer source uspto attorney i specifically asked this question to
technology,not_removed,id like to see quake broken down to just mathematical operations dont think its that simple what else happens magic
technology,not_removed,patents were essentially meant for ideas rather the subset of ideas that not only were implementable but include the implementation details i see no reason why an idea that is realizable in software ought to be handled totally differently than one that is realizable in hardware the main problem with our current patent system ultimately comes down to having too loose of standards for patentability and poor enforcement of the existing rules leading to granting tons of bs patents
technology,not_removed,you are asking me to prove a social development im asking you to prove nothing im only asking for evidence something that shows that this is a valid theory and not something you made up on the fly you already know this thats not why im pushing it im pushing it because i think it is something you made up on the fly and its ridiculous enough that i would like you held to account for stating it as a categorical fact and are looking to try to make a stupid point on the internet you made the point not i im just asking you to back it up still waiting
technology,not_removed,the unix parts are open source you can for example download the os kernel httpsgithubcomopensourceapplexnu you know that thing that generates revenue i know it doesnt they havent charged any money for any version or upgrade of osx for the last seven years
technology,not_removed,the government is incredibly corrupt of course but thats why it will never happen this whole scenario is speculative theres no point saying this thing that will never happen will never happen even if it does happen its a hypothetical scenario
technology,not_removed,those have really high barriers to entry yes you can look at it afaik chemistry is really difficult
technology,not_removed,its not random doubt i pointed out that the loss of antiquity tech probably has more to do with lacking printing capability than with a patent system the greeks had a kind of patent system btw but that has nothing to do with whether their knowledge got preserved after their civilization collapsed your argument that it was because of a lack of a patent system is absurd pharmaceuticals dont need patenting because the fda requires it knows what youve tested in trials anyway its just really not one of the strongest arguments for patents especially given that any patent can be stolen by those not beholden to your government system patent writers do their best to not file enough info to actually make the technology reproducible from the patent filing alone probably very few nontrivial patents really document the how of the tech enough for someone else to reproduce patents are almost entirely about securing rewad for invention with the idea that the promise of such rewards spurs more invention that aspect of patents seems to break down in areas where speed of progress is tremendous or where implementation is very very easy
technology,not_removed,the argument has been made that patent system surrounding pharmaceuticals is also extremely flawed so its not really a good comparison i made the comparison precisely because of those problems my point is that patents of physical systems have essentially the same problems as software patents i dont think theres much reason to abolish one but not the other we definitely need some serious overhauls though
technology,not_removed,no patents were never meant to protect ideas they were meant to protect useful inventions
technology,not_removed,yep im sure if you installed ubuntu on macs they would still be the hottest thing around and unix is only a tiny part of the os
technology,not_removed,well sure but we can safely ignore hypothetical which involve a situation which will be immediately reset under the rest of the hypothetical it seems to me complete removal of patent system has a drastically higher chance than a fix of the patent system alongside a massive change in peoples view of governments role and the limiting of its power as well as a change of the international market of ideas still beside this point what problems will elimination of the patent system bring back like i initially asked
technology,not_removed,i pointed out that the loss of antiquity tech probably has more to do with lacking printing capability than with a patent system and have yet to justify that with any evidence whatsoever pharmaceuticals dont need patenting because the fda requires it knows what youve tested in trials anyway yes they do because the patent describes how to make the drug not just the molecular formula take for example patent method for producing ibuprofen or preparation of aspirin its just really not one of the strongest arguments for patents i never made that argument probably very few nontrivial patents really document the how of the tech enough for someone else to reproduce probably again youre just guessing even to the extent of guessing how you think pharmaceutical patents work you have no domain knowledge at all and youre just throwing out scattershot cynicism laced with probablys and no examples no sources and no evidence this is a waste of my time im out patents are almost entirely about securing rewad for invention with the idea that the promise of such rewards spurs more invention sure if you say so
technology,not_removed,paying customers get videos while pirates get video wonder why people pirate
technology,not_removed,digital restrictions management or my preference digital repression mechanism if its that bad on windows gnulinux is really going to suffer from this shit
technology,not_removed,intel for instance notes that some streaming providers are requiring support for hevc which isnt supported in processors well shit i just put together a new build with an does that mean i wont be able to stream in when i get the right monitor video card is a geforce so i dunno
technology,not_removed,this is why i havent bothered getting a tv monitor or nextgen video card yet
technology,not_removed,when i was building a new pc i was appalled that nobody manufactures a blu ray drive for the pc that will playback all of the uhd blu ray movies what the actual fuck
technology,not_removed,plus i get to keep them on my own media server drm is more about getting people to pay multiple times for the same movie than it is about stopping actual pirates they dont want anyone to own a copy they want to sell you the right to see it in perpetuity
technology,not_removed,even worse i activated my amazon prime trial back in april and when i tried playing something from their video streaming service it told me that i need a compliant monitor connected specifically through hdmi for anything above i have a dvid cable which is pincompatible with hdmi connected to my hdcpcompliant monitor which is also connected by hdmi to my and has no issues there hbo go has no issues going hd but it still doesnt look like full i dont know if its their abysmal bitrate or the resolution itself their player offers no resolution information
technology,not_removed,for me its the dam format and drm if i want to watch a movie i dont want to find out that the aspect ratio is fucked that i need to deal with a menu and then after that it refuses to play on a the hell with the entire industry for christ sakes less is usually more
technology,not_removed,i cant quite put my finger on it
technology,not_removed,paying customers are once again the idiots
technology,not_removed,even now you cant watch netflix on linux on windows it works only on edge not any other browser unless you use silverlight
technology,not_removed,hdcp handicap
technology,not_removed,should still be fine i think from memory intel has integrated hevc decoding in their newest cpus but not for bit youll still be able to decode it but itll be using your cpu power and not an integrated chipset itll be fine as long as the bitrate isnt too high i have a and can decode bit hevc up to around mbit it gets a bit dicey after that should way outperform a though
technology,not_removed,you should be fine due to the gpu being supported if you are running windows anniversary edition personally in just going to pirate the vids and play them wherever the fuck i feel like
technology,not_removed,wondering the same thing i have a and a gtx
technology,not_removed,i believe thats referring to intels integrated gpu not the cpu itself nvidias latest generation support the standard
technology,not_removed,any cpu from the past years isnt going to have a problem decoding that in software
technology,not_removed,get a monitor for gaming and be happy theres still beautiful visuals to see in that serious hidef
technology,not_removed,i have a tv thats connected to my pc but use the tvs integrated apps or fire tv to play content because its more convenient to use and supports with hdr havent been watching netflix on my pc since then
technology,not_removed,the industries involved have become gluttonous and distracted enough for that to happen
technology,not_removed,studies have repeatedly shown that ramming invasive and flawed drm malware down the throats of consumers makes them want to buy more citation needed
technology,not_removed,just look at the amount of shit you need to deal with to play a modern aaa pc game for an example of this and yet they still sell not to me im pretty much gog only because i will not waste my money on something that tries not to work
technology,not_removed,i think i know the answer its because of fear of piracy which is exactly whats written in tfa and yes you can blame them they are making it slightly more cumbersome for pirates to capture content while making it extremely difficult for honest paying consumers such as myself to be able to enjoy content i can already download netflix rips if i wanted to pirates have already figured out a way and even more importantly it only requires one person to figure it out and then that unlocked copy is out there free to download for good media companies need to stop wasting their time trying to lock down their content because the only people its hurting is its customer base
technology,not_removed,their fear of piracy renders the content inoperable to me i dont run windows even if i had hardware my two options would be pirate do not consume neither option gives them any income hell im still buying g dvd because i dont want to deal with the drm shite
technology,not_removed,they want to perpetually resell you the right to see it ftfy the way you had it phrased would read as they only want to charge you once in order to see it forever and i know thats not what you meant
technology,not_removed,drm here is to prevent people from copying the movie its for streaming services
technology,not_removed,i was having that issue with my older computer monitor i could only get if i was watching my my tv
technology,not_removed,i wonder why chrome doesnt yet support the its been around for nine years slightly longer than chrome has existed
technology,not_removed,the windows app has their special higher bitrate
technology,not_removed,hdcp higher demand for content piracy
technology,not_removed,if you are running windows anniversary edition cancer and anal rape
technology,not_removed,same as amd iirc
technology,not_removed,i honestly dont mind and higher resolution doesnt interest me for gaming with my and aoc monitor i feel like im finally at the crest of the performanceresolution battle and i dont want to start another decade of knob turning
technology,not_removed,my pc still stutters on gaming just loading a jpg of a game is enough to make my pc bsod kidding of course not about the bit though
technology,not_removed,i think he was being facetious
technology,not_removed,i agree with this strategy but the problem is that there are lots of games which will never be offered there
technology,not_removed,try before you buy is the only way to go
technology,not_removed,its for streaming services do you mean subscription services drm makes sense for subscription services but for purchases its screwing the consumer
technology,not_removed,thats right drm works so well you cant find a single netflix original series in pirated form anywhere s
technology,not_removed,except it doesnt even prevent that
technology,not_removed,maybe because its windows only and windows isnt used so much at google
technology,not_removed,if they want to be a browser on windows they better start learning how to program windows
technology,not_removed,its tough for anybody who comes down with m
technology,not_removed,ill happily issue you your dose of digital heroin have an upvote
technology,not_removed,this laptop they found it on was an employees laptop that was checked out to him and that had never been connected to the grid system in any way they are literally stretching for a headline that is nothing more than a stupid employee getting malware from a questionable download of something edit i am going to include the quote from the original source article the washington post for clarity burlington electric said in a statement that the company detected a malware code used in the grizzly steppe operation in a laptop that was not connected to the organizations grid systems this computer was not connected to their grid system and probably would have never been essentially they found malware on an employees computer that would have never been connected to their grid control system and thats about it
technology,not_removed,it would help if we could still replace bios with more up to date openly auditable ones like coreboot if someone finds an exploit in an implimentation we use we might never know doesnt help us and uk goverments at the very least seam to be wanting backdoors put in making us all less secure
technology,not_removed,evidence of porn found on us employees laptop more at
technology,not_removed,the verge is not a good news source
technology,not_removed,this is certainly not news
technology,not_removed,while the electric grid wasnt hacked in this case we can be pretty certain russia was behind the hacking of ukraines electric grid so there is a precedent for the russians doing this people are quick to say this is fake news but theres a real threat here and not just from russia
technology,not_removed,well at least according to major security firm kaspersky russia doesnt produce any malware at all if she was they would have written a great many articles on it dont you think
technology,not_removed,thanks god we elected the siberian candidate
technology,not_removed,it all depends on the malware and how it got there something written by a russian script kiddie that was downloaded from a sketchy porn site is quite a bit different than state sponsored code that managed to get on the system through a targeted phishing attack just because it is only on a system that was never attached to the home network does not necessarily make it meaningless it also doesnt mean omg evidence putin himself hacked our voting machines it is very concerning though and does need to be taken very seriously whether it was state sponsored or poor it security practices it points to something that needs to be fixed
technology,not_removed,uhm yeah because they found it before the employee did something like use a usb drive that was plugged into his laptop on a machine that was connected to the grid did you not hear of stuxnet the usisreal got malicious code across an airgap computer by infecting contractors machines and then having them bring it in with them passively like that
technology,not_removed,it is possible though and you can place a sizable bet on the fact that our infrastructure is compromised in many ways hipaa is supposed to protect patient information and confidentiality but it is best effort some take it seriously most do not
technology,not_removed,you seriously think over half the country is really bigoted even after obama was reelected that would be ignorant my friend my room mate who is a muslim voted trump his entire family did some of these so called bigots would also be considered oppressed funny that
technology,not_removed,what a useless line of thought even if it was true so what youve got these bigotted people to vote left before why push them further away with this hyperbolic nonsense american liberals are disgusting too busy trying to eat each other than trying to win
technology,not_removed,uhm yeah because they found it before the employee did something like use a usb drive that was plugged into his laptop on a machine that was connected to the grid did you not hear of stuxnet i pretty sure after stuxnet they probably hardend their systems against an attack vector like that
technology,not_removed,im gonna quote the washington post article which this quote was mysteriously left out of the verge article burlington electric said in a statement that the company detected a malware code used in the grizzly steppe operation in a laptop that was not connected to the organizations grid systems this laptop was not connected to the grid system it was a personal laptop that was checked out but never was to be connected to the grids systems
technology,not_removed,its not possible though and thats the problem people are writing articles about things they have no clue how they work power is a ferc and nerc regulated business and there are massive security measures that are in place to prevent this from occurring these security measures are also audited twice a year actual grid systems are completely segregated from the normal network and all access to it goes through multiple firewalls and auth systems first off only systems that are approved to communicate to that segregated system can all other traffic is killed by default and then the systems that can talk to that system are not allowed to touch the external world they also require factor auth with standard rsa keys being used lastly all communication is monitored on those systems and any unauthorized traffic sets off alarms everywhere simply infecting a single machine just does not cut it
technology,not_removed,how do you harden your system against idiots breaking airgap also were talking about a small regional power company not a nuclear facility here
technology,not_removed,so what that wasnt my point
technology,not_removed,yes in a well configured system there would be many limitations but there are not that many that are configured correctly
technology,not_removed,how do you harden your system against idiots breaking airgap fill in every usb port with hot glue were talking about a small regional power company not a nuclear facility here treated about the same security wise though now due to the fact that they are considered primary targets for cyber warfare
technology,not_removed,so this article and what they are hoping for was a huge fucking stretch the russians had nothing to do with this and this was simply a case of some idiot getting malware on their computer this wasnt a case of best effort hipaa it is a case of a reporting trying to force an idea through that does not hold with what the original content of the article was the dnc and feds want so badly to blame the russians for the election and many other things you get their mouthpieces like the wp and verge putting out shit articles like this that serve to do nothing but incite idiots
technology,not_removed,perhaps you did not read or understand they get audited twice a year they have to be correct its federally regulated
technology,not_removed,the problem is that the systems that run the electric grid and the plcs and all the equipment involved were made long before internet security was a problem so security wasnt designed into the products nor the networks its not like they can just upgrade to windows on these systems theyre extremely difficult to upgrade without rewriting all the code for modern operating systems so while you think theyd just increase the security its not a simple problem that can be fixed quickly or cheaply youre also talking about private electric companies that dont want to spend their profits on security republicans dont want more onerous regulations so the government cant regulate to ensure power companies are complying with security best practices ted koppel wrote great book last year called lights out that considers the threat of an adversary taking down a large part of our power grid its worth reading its also worth noting that weve found the chinese inside our electric grid before and were almost certainly doing the same to our adversaries its how one prepares cyberspace in case of a war
technology,not_removed,speaking of mouthpieces for special interests
technology,not_removed,oh i thought you were talking about hipaa not our grid but our grid can be hacked in other ways as there are flaws in the system regulation and security checks cant fix the physical
technology,not_removed,actually it can the centre has three layers of physical security double doors security sign in and double factor authentication to get through the door the grid system has no other external connections to it so you cannot just jack in to physically plug in you would need to get around all that security otherwise it is only accessable through previously mentioned dual firewalls and all that is it still possible to get through yes and if they can it does not matter what security you used they are unstoppable
technology,not_removed,that isnt what im talking about
technology,not_removed,then what you are talking about
technology,not_removed,the power grid itself has many vulnerabilities there are issues that can cause a cascade that do not require access
technology,not_removed,name one i have personal experience and worked at one earlier this year so this should be good
technology,not_removed,nice try terrorist
technology,not_removed,thats what i thought dont talk about shit that you got no clue about
technology,not_removed,says the guy in the industry what is your job again
technology,not_removed,you articles are either wrong outdated or about someone attacking the physical lines and external hardware itself which is well beyond the scope of what this entire conversation was about my job is it this conversation was it and you switched to pole hardware get your shit together also while we are at it go look at thats where we are today
technology,not_removed,he doesnt sound very sure about it
technology,not_removed,additional confidence would not improve the actual product
technology,not_removed,sure he does hes just swedish
technology,not_removed,hes just from the north of sweden talking can be in slowmotion there
technology,not_removed,i only wish we could convince the public of this in regards to politicians
technology,not_removed,i was just poking fun at all the upward inflections
technology,not_removed,confidence is actually a good trait in a leader but accountability is also needed to weed out the buffoons
technology,not_removed,samsung already sold its hard drives to seagate and now no cameras their phones still hold a huge market share
technology,not_removed,theyve had one foot out the door globally for a while now rumours were swirling mid last year they were winding up the camera business the is okay but its got a very niche market and theyre getting harder to buy bh stopped carrying them last year
technology,not_removed,now we just need them to stop selling their shitty tvs here
technology,not_removed,samsung should quit every business it is in
technology,not_removed,the is okay but its got a very niche market and theyre getting harder to buy bh stopped carrying them last year on a countrybycountry basis samsung actually started pulling out of the digital camera market a while ago the fact that the is already hard to buy online is a part of that the was actually a very respectable camera you could easily say it was the most innovative apsc mirrorless camera on the market when it was introduced and it even had some good lenses available for it but it was a premiumpriced product and they were outflanked by sony with fullframe mirrorless cameras available in the same price range as samsungs apsc mirrorless system the people who had that much money to spend on getting into a new mirrorless camera system just chose the fullframe one even though the samsung was first with video and some other nice technology
technology,not_removed,so who makes good tvs
technology,not_removed,whats wrong with samsung tvs i dont have one i see a reddit headline about one model displaying ads but otherwise the ones i see in appliance stores look nice
technology,not_removed,good tvs as in the best or good as in comparable to samsung in price but better if its the latter then panasonic at least last for a while lg are good too if its the former then check it out yourself cos what u like wont be what someone else likes for that price
technology,not_removed,the japanese and the germans anyone but the chinese and koreans really electronics cars camerastheres the odd exception i guess
technology,not_removed,too many break from a stupid design fault a few moths after warranty expiry they dont support repair planned obsolescence at its best
technology,not_removed,didnt know germans made tvs at least not once a i can get in the us
technology,not_removed,ok good to know its funny that reminds me of our samsung washing machine we had it looked great came in a nice color with a matching dryer both on top of colormatched drawerpedestals after just about years the washing machine broke and wasnt worth servicing based on the quote we got so we replaced it with a more basiclooking white maytag without any drawer unit and at least we arent spending so much for fancylooking machines this time around
technology,not_removed,possibly not loewe very expensive many would say overpriced but very good and exceptionally well finished
technology,not_removed,yeah that was the only one i found i doubt it is available
technology,not_removed,samsung lg and vizio are the majors here
technology,not_removed,apple and google maps feel old compared to waze which is odd since google owns waze
technology,not_removed,they couldnt have increased the size of the model battery but they shrank the battery in the model so whats this article talking about
technology,not_removed,only compared to last years model they actually decreased the battery size in the model
technology,not_removed,id rather the new mbp have a hour battery life and of ram and not launched with nearly old intel cpus theres nothing pro about this refresh if youre going to keep selling a laptop with the same ram configuration as models which launched four and a half years ago stop calling it pro you want a pro laptop to render video or do editing on go look at the alienware gaming laptop on dells site configurable with of ram cpu and an nvidia gtx with ram oh yeah it actually has a screen so you can shoot and edit video natively its also cheaper than a loaded rmbp which will have a slower cpu slower video gpu lower resolution screen and half the ram while youre at it switch to adobe premiere lightroom and photoshop in the creative cloud license bundle your work will be platform agnostic unlike fcp which locks you into apple being locked into apple doesnt look very attractive right now
technology,not_removed,hi apple stop focusing on how thin you can make our laptops why dont do you something innovative and retro and allow us to add on external batteries ps i fail to see why i cant plug my iphone into the new macbook pro also why i dont have physical keys for id prefer to never hit an emoji turd on my keyboard while stepping through code sincerely almost every professional who uses a macbook pro
technology,not_removed,let me design a macbook pro first i would make it a touch screen with the highest colour gamut available and calibrate it with a adobe rgb and srgb with at least with good scaling across apps then make it thicker and add better thermal management bigger heatsinks and bigger and faster fans with a physical key to max out or overvolt the fan when needed then i would add a bigger and better battery with at least over and fast charging then ill add the option for a nvidia gpu like the or the with optimus for better battery life while maintaining performance ill make the default ram option of across all models then for io ill keep the magsafe but also add an option for charging via usbc with the usbc and add another usb ports and add an sd card slot and a gig ethernet port ill keep the quad channel speakers and add a subwoofer on top as well and tune it with some sound engineers and add an option to adjust it from within the os ill also add a better amp for the headphone jack for those monitor grade or open back headphones ill also release a super premium version made of titanium which will be fully upgradeable and will also use high grade anodised aluminium for all the bodies then ill also add full and fluid driver support for windows so that it works like a native os and add additional applications for management ill also keep the function keys intact but still add the touch bar hows that apple
technology,not_removed,oh nonsense the new has a battery the size of the old they downsized the batteries they could have left them alone there was no wh issue here
technology,not_removed,but they could have had a replaceable battery in their pro model oh wait no then jony ive would have had a stroke because he couldnt have made it even thinner than already almost pointlessly thin
technology,not_removed,their marketing has become in a word cattywampus
technology,not_removed,looks like the article was written before full details about the new models were available
technology,not_removed,it could be involved with increasing battery efficiency and the fact that they know the next batteries fitting in that formfactor case will be hours
technology,not_removed,while youre at it switch to adobe premiere lightroom and photoshop in the creative cloud license bundle your work will be platform agnostic unlike fcp which locks you into apple being locked into apple doesnt look very attractive right now if im trying to avoid apple lock in why the fuck would i chain myself to adobe immediately after breaking free
technology,not_removed,ive been an apple fanboi for a decade and im about fed up one point of contention though adobe sucks too edit in resolve resolve is free resolve is life
technology,not_removed,and not launched with nearly old intel cpus also known as the newest fucking cpu available kaby lake is not yet out for this tdp
technology,not_removed,it would be nice if you could provide them the newer cpu so the people on these technology forums could shut the fuck up about intels newest performance mobile cpu theyre using there
technology,not_removed,oh man you reminded me of my pismo it had an expansion bay for get this swappable batteries i loooooooooved that laptop pics look at this majestic wonder
technology,not_removed,you can plug your iphone into the new macbook pro the new laptops use the standard usb pd power delivery protocol unlike with magsafe it will be possible for parties to make their own chargers for macbooks now so if you want an external battery pack i expect youll be able to get one a few months from now not from apple though
technology,not_removed,tldr i dont understand why you dont make a laptop exactly like i want it
technology,not_removed,and bring back the model thats what i miss most about the newer macbook pros
technology,not_removed,i dont think this is an issue of cost savings but trying to make laptops as slim and sleek as possible
technology,not_removed,battery capacity has been gradually increasing over time but its been just that gradual it would be completely unrealistic to expect to fit much more in the way of watt hours into that thing in the near future
technology,not_removed,so keep the battery the same overall size with higher efficiency bam you have longer battery life this is easy will people pay extra for that fuck yeah they will
technology,not_removed,because its what most professionals are using in the industry and it runs on everything unlike final cut pro which only runs on mac
technology,not_removed,the point made by several review sites is that apple insists on sticking to its own bizarre release cycle instead of waiting for intel to release their new part and what ends up happening is consumers are constantly locked in a loop where they get old cpus in new macbooks
technology,not_removed,i was gifted this when i was by a data east employee in i had computer classes prior to then and was afraid of them it made me code since there was nothing else to do i had a year career at microsoft because of it and own my own fairly succesful company now it had a port for an external battery even it would allow you to bring a backup
technology,not_removed,no they dont you cannot outofthebox without secondary purchase and add on to attach your phone to the new laptop do no lie
technology,not_removed,i miss them too but httpwwwrazerzonecomgamingsystemsrazerbladepro seems like a worthy alternative
technology,not_removed,because who needs processing power
technology,not_removed,yea i hadnt realized it was such an extreme difference no ones mentioned it but the capacity is vs for the that is a ridiculous jump
technology,not_removed,point taken apple is late blame apple intel is late blame apple
technology,not_removed,surely a beast like that needs no backup p we are living in a world with some astonishing tech and brilliant minds to got with it apple is very good at capitalizing on future tech and trends in doing so they have regressed in many ways but thats only true if you believe they are focused on the professional community they clearly are not maybe they are still innovating but not in the way they use tothese laptops are expensive accessories first computers second
technology,not_removed,i didnt lie you said you cannot plug your iphone into your new macbook pro but you can yes it requires a different cable but you can plug it in
technology,not_removed,i guess market research says that people prefer pretty over functional
technology,not_removed,for a cncd alu chassis its more likely the less machining time that matters
technology,not_removed,the was the last model ill be buying every decision from there has been a mistake worse yet suffered a bad gpu and every model except mine was recalled so frustrating
technology,not_removed,they are not focused on the professional community the only reason why i use a macbook is because i am a software developer i write desktop software that runs on nix macos bsd apple nonsense and windows since apple only lets their os run on apple i sorta have to use it
technology,not_removed,so it requires apple tax to do that do you disagree or no can you provide a link to apples website that says otherwise no go away youre being raped lil boy
technology,not_removed,its happening again first phones were huge then they shrank a lot then they bloated up again because people wanted power now the previously bulky laptops are shrinking perhaps one day they will bloat back up too
technology,not_removed,honestly as much as i like longer battery life what is considered functional can be different depending on your perspective i dont think apple is doing thin for the sake of stuff being thin with thin comes increasing portability in the shape of smaller footprint and lower weight which are important functionalities with laptops you could argue that it doesnt need to be any thinner but i said that myself about the white macbook – for me that was already thin enough but looking back i cannot understand how i could have been happy with that it added a ton of weight to my backpack and didnt fit in my usual shoulder bag these are aspects of a functional laptop just as well that need to be taken into consideration furthermore it gives them a reason to push for usbc which brings forward the functionality of a unified computer connector currently the market is a mess and buying a new mbp will definitely provide additional daily friction but by having a popular product exclusively using usbc it provides enough of incentive for thirdparty product companies to produce usbc compatible devices much sooner than they would have otherwise done and the usbc exclusive future might come here in years instead of which will be better for everyone i dont think that the new gen mbp is for everyone currently its for professionals with a bit too much money in their wallet that dont use too many peripherals but give it a year or two and the price will sink to ordinary consumer levels and the usbc market will be a lot more mature this is after all what happened with the macbook air when it was first revealed the later popularity of macbook air wouldnt have happened if it wasnt for that initial overpriced waytoothin laptop without a cd drive that everyone thought was insane – it was a necessary step before being able to lower cost and make the market ready for a future where cds were obsolete
technology,not_removed,the vast majority of macbook pros are used for surfing the net from starbucks and typing notes in university classesunlike the idea commonly pushed where theyll all used for editing music and doing graphic design you want to know why apple isnt worried about making the most powerful laptop with the best gpu and most memory because thats not what the primary purchaser of apple laptops wants
technology,not_removed,pretty sure you could buy mac os seperately and make a hackintosh
technology,not_removed,no i cant provide a link to apples website that says otherwise i dont need to you said you cannot connect your iphone to your new macbook pro i pointed out correctly that you can
technology,not_removed,considering technology is shrinking and shrinking i highly doubt we will see any bloating back up is nearing batteries are shrinking in physical size but are gaining extra mah performance on some of intels low power mobile chips are astonishing for how little watts they use
technology,not_removed,with an adapter is there another way without an adapter cut the bs dude do i need to rewrite my shit snip off some cables what the connections are not the same what do i do to connect my iphone to a new macbook pro
technology,not_removed,batteries have advanced slower than most other tech out there and most of the focus has been on making more efficient hardware to deal with the fact that you can only run a laptop for a few hours at full power at best then it degrades after a few hundred charge cycles then you gotta replace it they are a lot better than they were decades ago but until i can run my devices full tilt all without degrading it over the course of one lousy year i will consider them to be primitive
technology,not_removed,with a cable is there another way without an adapter cut the bs dude what bs are you talking about i said you can connect your iphone to your new macbook pro and you can wheres the bs part the only bs i see is you saying you cant do it what do i do to connect my iphone to a new macbook pro you buy a cable that has the right connectors and then you connect it
technology,not_removed,you can easily connect wirelessly its actually automatic so you do t need to do anything
technology,not_removed,so you need to buy additional product to use their shit on their device apple tax its nonsense i prefer modern shit not proprietary rip apple you killed the professional community were off to oddly microsoft as a company who can suit our needs evolution as i see it apple rised fell rised and fell again go focus elsewhere and do good
technology,not_removed,so you need to buy additional product to use their shit on their device yes but you can do it as i said and despite what you said apple tax its nonsense you can buy a party cable if you prefer to not pay apple new connectors mean youre going to have to use adapters for a while if you want to connect your macbook to your iphone the cable that comes in the box is there to let you charge it from the adapter that comes in the box which uses usba instead of usbc youre generally supposed to connect your new phone to the cloud or connect it to your laptop with wireless bluetoothwifi but as a developer you talked about writing code i think you have to use a cable to connect and use xcode so youll have to buy a cable or adapter from apple or a party
technology,not_removed,isnt that what we do when we imagine something a basic description of a thing of which we then imagine an image in our brain scary stuff

technology,not_removed,i thought being triggered was just lame pc bullshit yet my comment seems to have triggered you also wtf does your comment even have to do with anything that i said admit it youre just another bought and paid for rump ranger that is totally out of your depth when confronted by anyone with even the slightest capacity for critical thought go wallow in the big bowl of cheeto slime that is your fearless leader
technology,not_removed,just download the pdf its easy
technology,not_removed,no being triggered is very real and youre showing a classic sign of being triggered in your previous comment its angry unintelligible nonsense but dont worry youre not alone i have a long proven track record of triggering useful idiots and causing them to say stupid shit
technology,not_removed,i just looked through it very quickly and it is typical of intelligence estimates it makes a bunch of claims then quickly provides enough evidence to suggest that things might not be as bad as them seem one statement was very telling the inability to maintain and service submarines became the achilles heel of the soviet navy russia must do better if it hopes to maintain its enhanced operational tempo as a former submariner i can say that russian submarines were often extremely well designed however as good as some of their crews were poor maintenance did not do them any favours and it appears not much has changed again i will suggest that the headline does not quite match the material

technology,not_removed,what is your problem
technology,not_removed,wireless isnt a catchall solution security is a concern i recently went through the trouble of encrypting my setup with luks so it asks for the passphrase on boot i do not feel comfortable typing the passphrase into a wireless keyboard on a regular basis for a government drone or snooper to collect from outside so i have two keyboards plugged in now you see i use a kvm switch with two usb ports intended for a keyboard and a mouse but a wired keyboard is plugged into one port sitting in the keyboard tray and a logitech unifying receiver is in the other which communicates with the wireless mouse and wireless keyboard that im free to move around with in addition to security concerns with wireless it also suffers from slower performance than a wired link so wireless should be an option but it shouldnt be the only option
technology,not_removed,how butthurt the whole damn world is about the updates to the iphone and new macbook
technology,not_removed,i completely understand all of that and agree to some extent but johnny goodfornothing who lives down the road doesnt give a shit and just wants his phone that he chose to buy to work with his headphones and macbook at the same time all im saying is it will in the future and itll be much easier so old mate johnny needs to chill

technology,not_removed,httpwwwdigitaltrendscomapplestevejobsthegodfatheroffontsasweknowthem
technology,not_removed,butthurt fanboi detected
technology,not_removed,stares in disbelief they are suing because the driver couldnt put down his phone long enough to give a single shit about the safety of the family and wants to blame apple for not treating a reasonable adult as a child
technology,not_removed,cases like this are why i have to dismiss a stupid fucking notification every single time i start my car and use the navigation system
technology,not_removed,how can apple tell if the driver is using the phone or a passenger
technology,not_removed,can we all please acknowledge personal responsibility
technology,not_removed,as an ios developer this is the stupidest lawsuit ive ever seen apps require permission to track your movement and have no idea whether a person is driving or not movement tracking drains battery like crazy and is a huge privacy concern which is why its not enabled in of apps including facetime the plaintiff is demanding that the iphone violate the privacy of all of its users and become a worse product screw that guy and his poor life choices
technology,not_removed,theres also restriction apps that disable certain functions when the device is clocked at over a certain speed
technology,not_removed,while this is sad it is clearly a money grab companies can only advise you to not use technology in certain manners while driving they should be suing the driver garrett wilhelm regarding their daughters death
technology,not_removed,apparently its ok to not take any responsibility for your own actions at this point
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,not enough face not enough palm
technology,not_removed,i mean i dont want to be the one who says it but why am i not surprised this is coming out of california who the ffffff thinks its ok to blame apple are these people so stupid to think its ok to face time while piloting a pound hunk of steel with kids in it at mph in traffic thats like me trying to warm gasoline up with a blow torch while its pumping out of the nozzle
technology,not_removed,so if guy is eating a burrito while driving also known as distracted driving and drips it down his shirt looks down and stops watching the road ends up rear ending someone he now has the right to sue the fast food restaurant that served him that burrito nice reminds me of the ct who spilled the hot coffee in her lap and mickey ds then sued cuz the coffee was hot that makes me think next time theres a hailstorm and my car gets dented ill sue every church on earth to be extra sure the right goddeity is held accountable
technology,not_removed,why do they have a patent for something they arent using failed to introduce technology it had a patent for that could potentially have prevented the driver from using the app
technology,not_removed,yup every time i have ever bought a coffee it is too hot to drink at first it always burns your tongue i know not to stick something that hot between my legs
technology,not_removed,so as much as i love hating on the guy who committed manslaughter it doesnt seem like hes the one suing the family is suing apple and good for them theyre pissed at a company could have helped prevented their daughters death go get some money from the billion dollar corporation but be warned the internets might get cranky
technology,not_removed,i think thats an accurate summary yes had to read it myself and came away with the same take
technology,not_removed,the people who are suing apple is the family that got hit by the distracted driver and had their year old daughter killed not the person who crashed into the car i doubt they will win the lawsuit but they prob felt they could get more by suing apple rather than going after the young driver who hit them
technology,not_removed,same thing people who sued over pokemon go did nobody wants to be responsible for themselves
technology,not_removed,i am not an apple fan at all but wow this is a bullshit case if i have seen one hope apple makes them look like clowns in court
technology,not_removed,its much more serious then that though he rear ended a parked car doing mph killed a five year old and almost killed another child this is one of the few times that i think years in prison is an appropriate sentence
technology,not_removed,i absolutely loath these asshats nearly everyday i see someone nearly rear ending a car or going miles an hour under the limit changing lanes on top of other people suddenly turning at the last second etc and each time they have their phone glued to their ear never once putting it down not even after almost hurting other people if one thinks about it objectively its pretty damn stupid to be talking on your phone while trying to drive in crazy fast unpredictable traffic texting is even worse what call or text is worth killing yourself or others
technology,not_removed,in some cities like nyc public transportation is way faster than driving of course there was a girl who sued coned because she fell down a manhole texting while walking
technology,not_removed,i agree i can see having to accept the popup at least once or for a short time period hell even have an option in settings to disable the popup which tells you the risk one last time but being forced to see it every time forever is preposterous
technology,not_removed,the real question is why should apple be legally responsible
technology,not_removed,it cant if you read the patent it talks about the idea of analyzing video background to look for motion if the detected motion exceeds a certain threshold they could take actions such as disabling facetime two problems they dont have the technology only the idea it cant discriminate between you being the driver the passenger or even the passenger in the drivers seat apple is accused of failing to implement technology they dont have which brings up the bigger point what if apple did have the technology apple is under no obligation to add the safety feature even if they have it this is how you stop idiot laws when idiots die you categorically reject the additional safety requirements not only should apple not be required to add the technology apple should be required to not add the technology if i want to talk a virtual passenger in my car that is my business i reject this lawsuit and all those like it
technology,not_removed,they cant which is probably why they havent implemented it
technology,not_removed,i think they actually applied for a patent like years ago where it used the camera to see what side of the car it was facing
technology,not_removed,pfft who cares about personal responsibility when theres a buck to be made blaming someone else
technology,not_removed,we dont do that everything is always someone elses fault especially when you can post a video online and suddenly suzy the soccer mom is offended video goes viral and sudden the internet is outraged gofundme page is started up idiot gets a boatload of cash rinse and repeat hell we have entire cultures based on perpetual victimization and no accountability its very rewarding for them
technology,not_removed,yes the phone cant determine if youre in a car driving or on public transport for instance or even if youre just a passenger and not the driver basically they would have to make it so facetime would not work at all if you were moving which would limit the functionality i think the best they could do is put in a message like you are in a moving vehicle are you sure you want to facetime as the app starts to cover the legalese it will just be another thing you have to click on for legal purposes that will annoy people
technology,not_removed,the people who are suing are the victims who were hit not the the person who was driving while using facetime
technology,not_removed,californian herei am a little offended as its actually referring to something that happened in texas and we have laws saying you cant use your phone at all when driving here so fuck off and get some reading comprehension
technology,not_removed,why am i not surprised its called confirmation bias
technology,not_removed,you should watch the documentary hot coffee it will open your mind the lady youre talking about had third degree burns and simply wanted mcdonalds to pay her medical bills mcdonalds refused look up pictures of the burns theyre horrifying i get your point but referencing the hot coffee lady does not help it
technology,not_removed,for your analogy to match this situation the person who would sue the burrito place would be the person who gets rear ended not the person who bought the burrito
technology,not_removed,if the phone has this feature built in but the user jailbroke his phone and sidestepped the feature would it be ok to sue apple for not securing the device well enough to prevent him from getting around the security feature
technology,not_removed,companies publish patents for all kinds of stupid things that are not even practical there is no punishment or requirement that you actually do something with the patent you cannot control circumstances such as a company might just find the patenttechnology defunctsuperseded useless a year later the patent office already has enough work reviewing new patents as is and having them constantly reviewing millions of patents each year would be insane
technology,not_removed,apple didnt kill their kid apple isnt liable if we go down this rabbithole the only future is one where companies wont even develop safety ideas because its not worth defending in front of an uninformed jury about how they couldnt have developed the safety feature or determined that it wasnt economical to add the feature because testing suggested it wouldnt have sold as well or any number of other legitimate reasons for that feature not being available
technology,not_removed,like all lithium batteries that are broken it ignited thats not true not all lithium batteries have inflammable electrolytes batteries dont but even if you mean lithium ion batteries there are some that dont ignite when crushed or pierced
technology,not_removed,to be fair the phone exploding doesnt sound like his fault from your description it sounds like a legitimate complaint if im in an accident i dont want my phone to explode tesla had this problem so they installed titanium guards on their batteries to prevent steel rods from piercing the battery from below
technology,not_removed,wait what happened with pg
technology,not_removed,coffee is hot youre misreprenting this situation go watch the netflix documentary mcdonalds pr did a good job of shifting blame
technology,not_removed,woo what coffees hot well i be dammed
technology,not_removed,yes and he should never be allowed to drive again but sadly he will
technology,not_removed,there was a car accident in the drivethrough at mc donalds here a couple of weeks ago i wonder how it happened lol seriously how do you run into someone in a drive through
technology,not_removed,in some cities like nyc public transportation is way faster than driving ie sensibly designed cities with properly funded public transport
technology,not_removed,cus they have more money than the driver so more incentive to sue
technology,not_removed,i want to upvote you but i refuse to because the shouldnt be any requirement against imposing safety features if a company wants to potentially but their own business by imposing a rule like that they have every right to do so i agree that they shouldnt add those features but i disagree that they should be required not to add them
technology,not_removed,it also removes liability from waze if you say im the passenger and youre not and get in a crash waze is not going to be responsible whatsoever
technology,not_removed,clever but people would just block the camera if they wanted to use it from the drivers seat
technology,not_removed,some may consider this case outside of regular usage scenarios well regular scenarios should and usually do include regular accidents you dont see cars explode very often because reality is not hollywood but also because there are safety measures to ensure that the likeliness is reduced in regard to batteries maybe because of the likeliness of them to explode maybe they should be regularily encased in some hard solid case ok that would make your superslim assphone thicker but well the chance to charcoal the top of skin is a regualar one without it
technology,not_removed,professional victims i knew a chick who pulled in around a year over a few years using this business model what i found astounding about her mentality was the way she squandered her earnings on prestige rentals instead of just buying them outright she was broke and living on a friends couch years ago when i last saw her and nothing to show for it not even a tan
technology,not_removed,hey my definitely not a cruise missile model rocket needs reliable guidance sues the air force
technology,not_removed,texan here its illegal to use a cell phone while driving unless you are using a hands free kit

technology,not_removed,and to think that this stupid overly used scapegoat of a lawsuit could have been entirely skirted by simply instituting an affordable healthcare industry in the us
technology,not_removed,horrific yes but i still wouldnt say it was mcdonalds fault the lady had the worst possible scenario if the mcdonalds employee had spilled it on her i would have agreed bu she was in the car and had it in between her legs
technology,not_removed,hmmm but was there guacamole 🤔
technology,not_removed,if you can put a safety feature on your app but you dont because it will affect sales you shouldnt be too surprised if there are consequences like a lawsuit for the record its not about developing a safety feature either apple and thousands of others already have access to this feature they took a short cut to make more money and now they will have to face a lawsuit that even if they lose it will do next to nothing to damage their stock or image but please lets get that internet blame train going damn parents not having a reasonable internet response for the death of their kid wheres my pitchfork lets get them
technology,not_removed,you want apple to reinforce the battery with titanium of course its his fault
technology,not_removed,people falling off cliffs and buildings and also trespassing
technology,not_removed,i think he downvoted you so he wouldnt have to answer your question
technology,not_removed,sure the coffee was held at but that still does not excuse this woman from the responsibility of assuming that coffee is fucking hot no matter what unless its iced coffee dont put hot shit between your legs that can spill
technology,not_removed,even if you take everything they did into account coffee is hot if i spill it on myself i expect to be burned i do not drive with a cup of coffee between my legs if i did that is my stupidity not mcdonalds they can serve their coffee at degrees if they want to that lawsuit was frivolous and should have been thrown out
technology,not_removed,years should really put driving habits in perspective
technology,not_removed,right i would bet good money they asshat that caused it was either a high andor drunk b in a hurry trying to intimidate the person in front of them to somehow go faster wtf or c was paying more attention to chatting on kiksnapchatwhatsapp that they werent paying attention or d all the above i say out of the gene pool now before you spawn turdlets kids 🤔🤦🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
technology,not_removed,i agree that they shouldnt add those features but i disagree that they should be required not to add them you are right i was being glib but unfortunately the courts oftentimes do the wrong thing ideally product liability laws would be changed in order to do an endrun around a court decision against apple in this case we can create a law to nullifies any such order
technology,not_removed,jesus christ she is good appalling yes but a year is somewhat impressive do it for a few years invest in low cost index fund take some low maintenance job and sooner rather than later retire comfortably
technology,not_removed,not trying to ding texas was just stating the facts for the ignorant twat above me who can barely read and decided to insult my state for some reason
technology,not_removed,i use mine hands free on a very limited based when needed if traffic starts getting heavy or the asshats come out trying to cause accidents i hang up im actually responsible and can handle talking while driving some of these others get totally immersed in their conversation with their godsister or exbabydaddy and dont watch the road
technology,not_removed,the coffee was hot enough to melt human flesh it doesnt matter if the lady spilled it if she had drank it it would have given her third degree burns in her mouth or esophagus the coffee was too fucking hot
technology,not_removed,the cup melted if i hand your kid a cup of tea and it melts while they are drinking it are you going to blame the kid for getting burnt
technology,not_removed,yes and it is all at the bottom of the burrito
technology,not_removed,but theres no way for them to differential between a driver and passenger if you ride the bus every day and a family member wanted to facetime with you one day how livid wood you be if your phone refused to let you text or facetime them because it decided you were traveling at an unsafe speed and blocked you from doing anything under the envelope logic they you might be driving for that matter why arent we seeing lawsuits against every car manufacturer for not prohibiting their cars from exceeding the speed limit when a driver gets ticketed they could keep a car from speeding so why arent they
technology,not_removed,you know whats a safety feature the off button
technology,not_removed,this is stupid logic should coffee cups be sold with a special lid that the driver cant use while driving how about cigarettes and vaping should they develop something so the driver cant use it while driving explain how apple didnt use their idea because they thought it would negatively affect their sales do we really need warning labels on every fucking item because people cant act with a modicum of selfresponsibility hmmm should i play with my phone while driving my family along at sounds a bit risky to me i could get distracted and crash the car no wait theres no warning label telling me not to so it must be okay
technology,not_removed,yes because by giving an example i was completely saying that one solution is applicable to every situation you are completely correct and im not being sarcastic at all i feel like im talking to a five year old here
technology,not_removed,so if i drive my car into a wall or into a fire and it explodes i should demand the manufacturer accounted for this scenario youve majorly strawmanned my argument here but ill give you the benefit of the doubt and presume that you didnt mean to do that getting in a bike accident is not a rare occurrence phones should not explode when exposed to bike accidents end of proposition do you not believe that phones shouldnt explode when the owner gets into a bike accident what about a scooter accident what about tripping and falling bumping into a wall what is the least extreme type of accident you believe is appropriate for a phone to explode after experiencing
technology,not_removed,wow people actually walk off a cliff
technology,not_removed,go watch the documentary hint the judgement was split responsibility or whatever the legal term is
technology,not_removed,they can serve coffee at degrees if they wanted to do you generally drink coffee under this assumption wait hours for it to cool off before letting it touch you because if you even take a swig before that degree coffee will cause near instant degree burns i dont think you understand just how bad degree burns would be on that one spot you touch the coffee at let alone of your entire body most people assume their coffee to be at a drinkable temperature which is low enough to not cause third degree burns
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,using the term assphone i tried to make clear that i dont want to single out one specific company its not like only ferraris or just only fast cars have seat belts or structural integrity etc regardless if its an iphone exploding or a samsung or a nokia brick safety is of importance what you design be it cars exploding washing machines or smart phones considering the strain and use on modern smartphones there needs to be some safeguard to stop them from exploding and once the pads notebooks or other appliances are down in price and up in use so they start to pose a realistic every day use danger due to battery failure well then they need safety measures too
technology,not_removed,well youd think around settlement from her fathers death shed never actually met him in the years since she was born lasted a few years then the settlement for slipping on her own burst waters on a train i think it was a train followed with a couple of smaller claims averages out tragic it is
technology,not_removed,no offense taken i was just trying to help out
technology,not_removed,coffee is fucking hot if youre not smart enough to feel how hot it is before pouring it down your throat you really dont deserve to make it
technology,not_removed,this is reddit people will blame the kid for even being born didnt want to get injured well maybe you shouldnt have had your parents conjure you into existence
technology,not_removed,they dont have to differentiate between the driver and passenger if you suddenly start going after standing still it can ask if youre a driver or passenger if youre a passenger click the box and youre done no big deal but if youre a driver and you click that youre a passenger then you are willingly misusing the product its on you however adding that feature costs money and affects product use so basically it was decided that it wasnt worth it to add theyll get sued by people and deal with it for less money
technology,not_removed,if you mass produce items in america you cant expect the users to always use your product in a responsible way should you have to tell people that using your phone is dangerous when driving absolutely not however thats not the way it is these companies have dealt with millions of lawsuits and they know its a requirement they chose to not include it knowing that they would have to deal with lawsuits like this and it will cost them less to deal with this lawsuit than it would to provide the warning
technology,not_removed,i dont know offroad biking can be considered an extreme sport probably it isnt smart to take iphone which can literally brick itself after falling out from your own pocket on a walk for high speed biking it is like you would be mad on wine glass for breaking while mountain climbing it isnt companies fault you are a moron and you use their product wrong i mean if you really want to take iphone while biking it is your responsibility to buy some hard shell
technology,not_removed,your logic is just ridiculous apple is not responsible for making your phone indestructible if i wanted to throw my phone out the window apple should reinforce it against that too no a phone is for talking its not meant to be used biking down a mountain you honestly sound like a year old yourself who doesnt understand people are responsible for their own belongings if you break something you dont get mad at the company who makes the item you broke
technology,not_removed,yes so every device should be impossible to break at high speed collisions yes we dont want phones exploding in accidents but its a luxury device thats meant to be handled with care dont get into an accident or accept the risk if you take the phone along i feel like im talking to a year old that wants to push blame off onto who provided the tech and not how it was used
technology,not_removed,this argument doesnt make sense one bike accident caused a phone to explode and it was not your average bike rider accident there have been thousands of accidents with no phones exploding how does that make the iphone unsafe its not like it exploded in every bike accident
technology,not_removed,that is your opinion like i said to me if they had sold the coffee even hotter it still is not their responsibility
technology,not_removed,unbelievable that people can spend so much without noticing or caring
technology,not_removed,there are regulations about how hot coffee or other hot drinks can be served she was able to prove by the severity of her burns that the mcdonalds coffee was being served above this limit if the coffee was at the appropriate temperature the burns would not have been so severe
technology,not_removed,but why the law is already clear in most states that any use of your cell phone outside of handsfree or emergency situations is illegal at best some laws allow for manual use for purposes such as navigation if apple should have to put up a banner or make the driver say he isnt driving while operating a deviceapp then drivethrus shouldnt give food out to cars with only a driver unless the driver specifically states he wont eat and drive there are countless other examples of ways in which the driver at fault was using or doing something recklessly while driving the only person at fault for this is the driver who wasnt paying attention apple should not be at fault for the actions of their users
technology,not_removed,youre a fucking idiot
technology,not_removed,you had me for the first half of your comment theres a difference between a phone surviving a fall and the owner surviving a fall due to the device exploding cfl bulbs contain mercury vapor which is incredibly toxic to humans do you disagree with the bulbs being doublewalled just in case you accidentally drop the bulb and it breaks it would be your own fault for dropping the bulb after all it isnt the light bulbs fault you used it wrong and dropped it
technology,not_removed,he was being sarcastic you must be really dense
technology,not_removed,yes so every device should be impossible to break at high speed collisions note to self rtechnology is bad at logic yes we dont want phones exploding in accidents but its a luxury device thats meant to be handled with care dont get into an accident or accept the risk if you take the phone along phones stopped being luxury devices long ago i feel like im talking to a year old that wants to push blame off onto who provided the tech and not how it was used im not pushing blame anywhere im simply refuting the people saying that apple is completely innocent in this matter if you know anything about engineering design and pe certification you know that you literally hold peoples lives and livelihoods in your hand if a bridge were only rated at pounds and collapsed when a ton truck drove over it youd probably say that bridge designer is responsible i would but why the bridge wasnt rated for poinds its the truck drivers fault for risking himself by driving over a bridge if he didnt want to risk it he should have found another bridge but the bridge should be rated for more well how much more and who are you to say that read the above paragraph and without using wishywashy laymans interpretations of what if normal or reasonable tell me why one is the victims fault and one is the designers fault
technology,not_removed,exactly because apple took a stance and said when they designed the battery protection this much trauma on the device is tolerable beyond that we dont care that conscious choice is what is up for debate its a decision made in every engineering design that has the potential to harm the user but that doesnt mean that making that decision absolves apple of responsibility for that choice
technology,not_removed,it is their responsibility there are guidelines for food for reasons if they had followed them then this lawesuit wouldnt have happened
technology,not_removed,ah youre one of those people its not the companies fault for selling you an unstable explosive its yours for dropping it inches and therefore blowing up your entire family
technology,not_removed,where there regulations before or after this case
technology,not_removed,i completely agree unfortunately its not how it is and rational thinking isnt always the first place people go to when their lives have been devastated like in this case if you believe that someone is responsible in the slightest way for your child dying wouldnt you want some kind of revenge or closure
technology,not_removed,im sorry the companies you worship arent angels but what i said isnt an opinion its a summary of whats actually happening there are laws that have been put into place that place a burden on the company before the user its a shame you have literally nothing to add to the conversation other than a downvote and insult
technology,not_removed,it would be your fault if you carried one of the bulbs mountain biking like an idiot
technology,not_removed,you wouldnt take a light bulb on offroad bike riding would you i am certain that it also would not survive this kind of accident even with two walls of protection of course phillips should be sued when someone decides to go offroad biking after bulb shopping
technology,not_removed,it is your fault though you chose to carry the phone in your pocket its not like phones are at all a necessity you want to carry a phone on you all the time well then this could potentially happen
technology,not_removed,if you fall in a certain situation sensitive electronics will be damaged how do our think it should be designed to avoid this a phones battery being pierced and burning g you severely is nowhere near grenade levels obviously never seen the actual aftermath of a grenade for me i only care if the company didnt out effort towards preventing the issue and if it is seen as way to easy to ignite if i drop my iphone or throw it down and it explodes thats probably too easy if it takes a rare case or a very specific situation to cause catastrophic failure then im fine with that due to its rarity how common an event happens is important and cant be treated entirely the same as the common one diminishing returns applies here and is inversely proportional to usability every device has this issue
technology,not_removed,he actually wasnt you must not know what sarcastic means
technology,not_removed,apple is innocent though they publish a device with reasonable protection when the device is malformed punctured or physically stressed it has failure thats almost certain of any electronic device theres a difference in bridges and phones those are not comparable at all a bridge would never be rated for that low of a rating if you had a bridge that character handle and then nasa chose to haul a rig thats not the bridge designers fault if the phone exploded from being dropped in water lightly bent and small dents then yes apple would be but the very uncommon and rare case of actually physically malforming the device apple cant really design against that no manufacturer really can with a bettery if they did you would have almost no battery capacity or a very very expansive product
technology,not_removed,but yet the standard for coffee is still degrees the same as it was in the mcdonalds case should we go out and sue starbucks httpsdelishablycomdiningoutstarbucksdrinkguideterms
technology,not_removed,depends was it marketed as safe and drop proof or was it marketed as a steaming hot cup of coffee that will burn you
technology,not_removed,youre defending people who cant take ownership for their stupid decisions youre whats wrong with the world you should find a lawyer while youre at it whos willing to sue duracell as their batteries combust if thrown into fire i stand behind my insult
technology,not_removed,so youre supposed to go out into the wilderness without a phone that seems to be what youre insinuating and that is not a good idea
technology,not_removed,so you believe companies are not responsible for anything regarding their product you would see no problem if phones exploded at the slightest bump i mean they arent designed for impacts and you shouldnt be so clumsy right you chose to carry it in your pocket like a normal person its such asinine logic i cant even fathom you actually believing this
technology,not_removed,if you fall in a certain situation sensitive electronics will be damaged and do you believe that the determination of what type of damage equipment should be designed to handle is one that does not come with responsibility how do our think it should be designed to avoid this i dont think it should i simply cannot say for certainty that apple is free of responsibility here i cant say theyre guilty im just an engineer who read an article on the web a phones battery being pierced and burning g you severely is nowhere near grenade levels obviously never seen the actual aftermath of a grenade obviously you dont know what lithium can do for me i only care if the company didnt out effort towards preventing the issue and if it is seen as way to easy to ignite if i drop my iphone or throw it down and it explodes thats probably too easy if it takes a rare case or a very specific situation to cause catastrophic failure then im fine with that due to its rarity you would be unless it happened to you pe certifications are hopefully owned by the engineers who made the decision to engineer for you falling down and not for a bike wreck other pe certifications are definitely owned by the engineers who will do their own research to determine and recommend if this ever goes to court whether or not the level of protection was appropriate for the accident and if the design should even be considered at fault if the design was not supposed to protect against such an event analysts will then determine the probability for each device to undergo such trauma then they will calculate the expected cost of failure to the user in medical bills trauma and loss of life each of these has their own probabilities of occurring and their own costs if a judge or jury decides that the expected cost to every user of the device is too high then that body has determined that apple was reckless in their protective design how common an event happens is important and cant be treated entirely the same as the common one diminishing returns applies here and is inversely proportional to usability every device has this issue so its costbenefit were going fullon fight club here arent we
technology,not_removed,they publish a device with reasonable protection are you saying this as a pe who has been studying material safety for years or as a layman whos speaking as someone who trusts apples pes to do the right thing a bridge would never be rated for that low of a rating youve obviously never been out in the boonies old wooden bridges for cars are everywhere once again youre making a conjecture that you dont know anything about you just assume that what is reasonable to you is true rare case of actually physically malforming the device do you remember that thing where everyone was mocking the iphone for being bendy passing as a feature of the device that didnt seem very rare or difficult to me no manufacturer really can with a bettery tesla did im not saying their solution works everywhere but they overengineered im saying apple possibly underengineered though i cant say whether or not they did for sure if they did you would have almost no battery capacity or a very very expansive product you said while discussing a device
technology,not_removed,so you are one of those people and the coffee wasnt marketed as such and mcdonalds had been repeatedly instructed by product safety agencies to reduce their serving temperature of the coffee go actually read the details of the case before opening your mouth again
technology,not_removed,im not defending them at all im saying its entirely within their rights to sue im not saying theyll win or lose im not even saying its reasonable to sue im saying that they have all the rights in the world to take this action if you cant accept that im sorry its literally whats happening if you have a problem with that you can try and help change that or you can insult people and feel like a big man and contribute nothing
technology,not_removed,he is obviously saying that you should buy a product that was made for using in the wildernessdoing high speed biking
technology,not_removed,your taking an isolated incident and talking about it like its a normal occurrence and your calling my logic asinine
technology,not_removed,i have read it the case is that the coffee was too hot mcdonalds at the time advertised that their coffee was the hottest and freshest coffee if a salesman came up to me and told me he had a bomb for sale and that this bomb would blow up my entire house if i dropped it then i bought it and dropped it that is on me i knew full well that the bomb was going to explode if i dropped it she knew full well that the coffee was hot and could burn her she chose to buy it knowing that then she chose to put it in her lap she is responsible for her own actions now if the bomb salesman said he this bomb is totally safe and you can drop it as much as you want then yes sue that fucker if mcdonalds ever claimed their coffee was not hot then she could sue but they clearly marketed the coffee as being exceptionally hot they shouted it as a advantage of mcdonalds coffee
technology,not_removed,nice try youre posting congratulations to the parents for suing a company and implying they deserve to be sued because theyre a successful company with lots of money its not apples fault they have a dead kid if thats not what you meant to say id revise your post as i wasnt the only person who misinterpreted your comment
technology,not_removed,no but you are responsible for getting gear for it companies are not responsible for making their products suitable for every hobby and that would be a huge economic waste take gardening gloves for instance there are some nice ones and you definitely should use a good pair while rock climbing if you use them for that however it is not the glove manufacturers fault if they fail its the same with phones there are purpose build devices for that and also cases made to protect the regular phone it is well known to the consumer that these are necessary to protect the phone in these cases by your argument phones the phone case industry isnt necessary because the oem must harden them if the user bought a case claiming to be suitable for mountain biking then sure they would have an argument against the case maker

technology,not_removed,you have a good idea develop it further
technology,not_removed,i think some stories in rupliftingnews have examples of what youre asking heres and and and one the top of my head planting tree seedlings along a highway could be a good idea since then youll be required to walk farther to hatch eggs or search for pokemon and plant trees at the same time or maybe there could be a community marathon for a cause wherein registration fees collected from pogo players could be donated to an organization for kids with cancer or a local library and such edit then

technology,not_removed,well if this can be used widespread i guess we could just desalinate sea water and restock our lakes fuck it just fill the grand canyon nobody is using it
technology,not_removed,fresh water not freshwater freshwater is an adjective maybe israel makes more adjectives now
technology,not_removed,and still steals it from the palestinians
technology,not_removed,gee i wonder why
technology,not_removed,great idea all countries should do this especially as some countries treat foreigners with less rights then their own citizens

technology,not_removed,i actually surprised theyre going to unlimited data for gig customers that was one reason i havent switched over i had decided to wait for google fiber which is still a couple months away
technology,not_removed,i have had the unlimited for a few months now wonder if it was a pilot program
technology,not_removed,dsl customers still at
technology,not_removed,seems like theyre starting to feel the heat from google fiber
technology,not_removed,yeah im on gigapower and ive had unlimited data due to bundling their iptv service along with it for quite some time now i thought it was something they did everywhere
technology,not_removed,i asked and they told me its still gb with those overage fees being correct
technology,not_removed,they say this every few years
technology,not_removed,ive been a mac user even through the near bankruptcy days in the midlate through steves return the turn around ppc to intel switch ect my mbpr quad might be my last mac apple is no longer interested in what used to be their core users its sad
technology,not_removed,i have tried out mac and prefer linux ubuntu os ok but i am not a huge unity fan
technology,not_removed,aesthetically though omg that laptop looks like an ugly piece of shit
technology,not_removed,yeah im sure all those creative pros are going to ditch adobe and move over to gimp
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,i would put my next bucks on an intel pc maybe a couple of years old or a good small footprint pc running a current linux best bang for the buck and best os i have a twoyear old macbook running the latest mac os x but i think that for what i do ubuntu and other linices are better os x is really geared for media types if you want a good os linux is better mac hardware is expensive to begin with and apple is migrating it to be closed and more oriented to social media rather than computing note reduction of ports and things like souldered ssd on main board of some devices that is really bad and it tells you that apple is going to charge you a huge price to get in and an even larger price if anything goes wrong i am less inclined to go with apple which i believe has been resting on its laurels since jobs died i also think that apple has become greedy like many corporations in the world it has lost its vision and creative edge which made paying the apple tax compelling having used a mac book pro for two years along side linux systems i am not all that impressed being able to run bash under windows after being forced to install a developer pack is not all that compelling id much rather have to choice to buy a bare pc with proven support for linux than to have to run it in dual boot with windows or be forced to run linux with aproval from microsoft another greedy corporation
technology,not_removed,linux pays the bills osx let me admin linux
technology,not_removed,really like the plug for its good to see the little guys getting some attention
technology,not_removed,i would tell people to shy away from i fully specd mine out serval pro and it didnt last two years after lots of troubleshooting it came down to be the fans they wanted additional to replace them when at that cost a company shouldve goodwilld them every time i use the computer i have to rr the fans after cleaning which lasts less than a week before i need to do it again and the machine will beep and turn off when it reaches temp for a comparison one of my mbp recently had a failed graphics card i found the extended warranty program online it was an early and brought it in for repair not only did apple replace the entire logic board they completely refurbished the machine whole new clamshell case top bottom indicated that it showed signs of wear new screen distorted display battery failing throttling machine to core and power supply faulty basically an entirely new computer years later that is customer service
technology,not_removed,dont blame mac users for wanting to jump ship hell i applaud those that do it but that unboxing video in the link was horrible im amazed the guy didnt dislocate his shoulder while jerking himself off by not cutting himself with his really sharp knife while lamenting that if he did it would get him even more youtube hits he had to be using a go pro so he could be constantly rubbing one out while marveling at the art of the inside of the box i had to shut that shit off after that that laptop has some sexy specs though too bad that douchebag couldnt keep it together for a decent unboxing
technology,not_removed,i crossed over into apple territory when vista happened i have lots of macs and have also been buying the surface pros since they started coming out too dont get me wrong the surfaces are fine devices and have gotten better with each iteration but im not ready to switch back to windows for three reasons windows is just worse than osx cosmetically and behaviourally i know the second part here might be more opinion than fact but ive had a lot less problems with osx than i have with osx is unix baked and i write a lot of software including ios in fact so im pretty much tethered to osx only at this point build quality high quality windows machines are rare i would class the as being a high quality windows machine but still not on par with the quality you know youre getting with an apple product the macbook fiasco has really ticked me off at apple ill probably end up staying within their ecosystem but ill just be using my rmbp and rimac until or something before i consider upgrading i can afford to upgrade as often as id like but just the principle of dropping on a macbook every other year as opposed to leaves a very bad taste in my mouth
technology,not_removed,been on linux for years bc of apples bullshit its mostly better over here anyway
technology,not_removed,my next phone will probably be the oneplus four when and if that comes out i just cannot justify paying upwards of £ for a phone that has less internal storage than what i currently have and a complete lack of external flash memory support i would have waited for my oneplus one to die out then bought an iphone but a lack of headphone jack is a deal breaker i for one like wired headphones and cannot justify paying an extortionate amount for a wireless pair that would probably be less comfortable than a decent pair of sennheisers
technology,not_removed,i moved to linux from windows in then moved to osx in due to the hardware quality and underlying unix setup windows now has a bash shell and im considering picking up a microsoft surface book since the hardware seems better now
technology,not_removed,alternatively i headed to and configured its oryx pro you can do so here i closely matched the macbook pro specs with a quadcore sklyake and nvme ssd instead of of ram as found on the apple i configured with you can go up to if needed by default it comes with a nvidia gtx the price less than in other words the machine with much better specs is less expensive than apples the display of the orxy laptops seems to top out at × how droll can i get it in cga
technology,not_removed,i love mac os but hate ios and dont like the current apple hardware offerings
technology,not_removed,it is not the software it is a hardware problem moving to ubuntu doesnt do anything
technology,not_removed,famed ubuntu laptop and desktop seller saw a huge jump in traffic from people looking to buy its machines the traffic was so intense that it needed to upgrade servers to keep up did it really i mean seriously
technology,not_removed,i have used apple computers since and followed their path a mac now boils down to a development box and some ease of use and hardware robustness since i do not see the point of getting a brand new one i recycle every five yearold machine i stumble onto and i am good to go
technology,not_removed,bought a pc desktop and an xps in the last days i used macs in the too ive seen this movie before
technology,not_removed,i was wondering if this was going to happen more progressively
technology,not_removed,what this doesnt even make sense well i was really disappointed with the new hardware so i switched software
technology,not_removed,ubuntu is not a good replacement for osx in any way shape or form thats a completely ridiculous headline
technology,not_removed,i just got an acer swift for a family member for running windows of course but it has a all metal case is very lightweight and looks very much like a macbook for that prices it was a great deal
technology,not_removed,it would have pushed about people to ubuntu so i guess that is some apple loyalists
technology,not_removed,if it pushes them to ubuntu i have no doubt that theyll come crawling back
technology,not_removed,i keep hearing the sd card excuse for hating the macbook pro dudehook up your camera with the damn usb cable your camera probably came with one directly to your macbook yeah you gotta buy a new usbc to microb cable for on amazon but whats the big deal you bought a camera so whats for a cable thats objectively better i understand taking your cards out of the camera in the field when theyre full but when youre at your desk uploading photos just hook your camera up to the computer its not like youre actively using your camera and while your photos are transferring the usb port can charge the battery too
technology,not_removed,im so so sorry
technology,not_removed,lol hurt and disgusted by lack of sd slot what fucking babies like a tiny sd readerusb hub is a big deal
technology,not_removed,windows comes with a linux bash
technology,not_removed,in other words the machine with much better specs is less expensive than apples business as usual nothing to see here what really would have been cool and would have made apple stand out is if they made the screen an oled it would instantly humiliate all those pcs with tn panels on the store shelves and even in advertisements if apple is going to charge so much they should provide the superfancy hardware to justify it
technology,not_removed,im with you i dont think ill own another new shiny apple computer i have high hopes they push techperformance on the next ipad pro but this lackluster macbook has me worried they arent concerned with the professional market anymore
technology,not_removed,the only reason i have my current rmbp is that it was the best hidpi laptop that was supported under linux at the time i will not be getting another one
technology,not_removed,if you were with them through all that time and some of their terrible laptops and desktops what makes you want to change now after kaby lake is introduced ram will increase to probably with apple will drop the price if sales arent good enough like they did with mba and iphone and usb typec will become industry standard fairly soon im not saying the mbps are perfect theyre far from it but this isnt the first time apple has bungled a new product what would be more suprising if they didnt fix it by the next years refresh with new cpus
technology,not_removed,ive used an apple laptop since the powerbook and im on my fifth iphone since the original i got at launch im buying a surface book this week and im hoping ms puts out a sweet surface phone next year if not ill probably go with a pixel for my next phone i feel like apple doesnt give a fuck about content creators anymore and ms is being brilliant by embracing us ill miss os x but i can always fire up a linux vm on my surface book if i need to do something with a nix system
technology,not_removed,apple is no longer interested in what used to be their core users its sad they have simply found a new core user base one that doesnt care about specs battery life etc they care about the badge on the lid and that it turns on
technology,not_removed,might haha this tells me you are in denial phase and will soon transition to acceptance phase and soon over next couple years will buy another mac
technology,not_removed,same here went to hackintosh a few years ago due to lackluster pro desktops and now laptops are out of the question
technology,not_removed,what would you get if you switched personally ive got an asus laptop that im planning to replace with an older thinkpad just want something durable
technology,not_removed,same situation but absolutely hyped for my incoming maxed out mbp to each their own
technology,not_removed,over enginnered crap that insists that you use every program and that constantly tries to force you to use it exactly the way apple engineers want you to
technology,not_removed,and what used to be that core users want besides a low spec overpriced laptop
technology,not_removed,their core audience always has been hipsters and it never changed it is you who grew out of it not apple
technology,not_removed,but i am not a huge unity fan youre in luck you can change the desktop environment trivially
technology,not_removed,there are some other desktops the big ones kde gnome unity gnome and unity are similar to each other im using mate continuation of gnome its been well maintained
technology,not_removed,get elementary os if you like mac it has an interface akin to it
technology,not_removed,unity sucks balls i use kde when i linux on my lappy
technology,not_removed,you can run ubuntu on a macbook if you want
technology,not_removed,i still dont care how my computer looks i know geeks lost this argument in the late nineties but i just dont care
technology,not_removed,holy shit you werent joking that looks like the gaming laptop i used to get back almost a decade ago in fact im pretty sure thats the same shell minus some of hte company logos
technology,not_removed,this is just me being picky but they logo is ugly as hell too the styling size all of it to me just looks very bad
technology,not_removed,i have a schenker which uses the same body and it looks much much better in real life i really like the angled looks looks really bad in pictures
technology,not_removed,look into librem same idea but they actually look like something from
technology,not_removed,no but in my office most of the design team is going to switch to surface studios when their imacs are up for refresh
technology,not_removed,of course not but all those data scientists app back end devs would be wondering why on earth they are paying more for less
technology,not_removed,i just find photoshop so much easier to use now that i know it
technology,not_removed,crossoverwine runs photoshop on linux for other things like drawing and vectors there are great linux tools for that blender krita inkscape
technology,not_removed,adobe products are pretty rubbish for anyone that has gotten used to a proper node based application nuke houdini etc im not saying gimp is going to take over but there are other tools for most workflows
technology,not_removed,ah yes the old photoshop excuse been hearing that one for years as if everybody uses photoshop to begin with
technology,not_removed,running osx on a non mac is a hobby all in itself thats not really what im looking for
technology,not_removed,i understand your point but in general apples software goes hand in hand with their hardware you can technically run macos on pc hardware but it violates the eula is not officially supported and they can technically change something that breaks compatibility at any time also the majority of people wouldnt buy a macbook to solely run an os other than macos simply because its not cost effective to do so the significance of the article is that people who are in the market for a new computer that may otherwise have bought a macbook are considering other options because they would rather have more hardware options and sacrifice the usage of macos
technology,not_removed,macos doesnt really run well on pcs unless hardware is vetted first im not sure about linux on macs it kinda works if you have the right hardware comes to mind
technology,not_removed,right im glad im not the only one
technology,not_removed,theres terminals that run on other things
technology,not_removed,same here im looking into that as well to largely replace windows
technology,not_removed,i didnt bother with the video
technology,not_removed,rmbp isnt even that oldwhy are you upgrading after only years you should still have good years left out of that thing at least
technology,not_removed,with the new unix bash in windows i thought about switching to my more powerful windows machine for work but i realized that i would miss many polished applications the ui is just ace windows still looks clunky and professional apps are rare or overpriced
technology,not_removed,everything about point is opinion i use surfaces and macs at work constantly id say surface has the edge in quality also quality windows machines arent rare anymore sounds like your stuck years in the past dell xps lenovo carbon asus zenbooks hp spectre all quality machines and those are just to name a few
technology,not_removed,if you were willing to spend mac kind of money on a windows system then the specs wouldnt have made vista such a mess
technology,not_removed,how do you deal with window management on macos ive got an imac and my core windows pc but its always a struggle to keep windows in macos organized compared to windows its the main reason i still use windows as my main os and dont really enjoy using macos
technology,not_removed,couldnt have said it better myself i agree with every points mr cook has killed the apple i had loved and evangelized for the past years i too will stick to the apple ecosystem for exactly the same reasons you listed but i no longer love it
technology,not_removed,what is your view on mac os compared with linux
technology,not_removed,bash shell is gimped because it uses a vm cant actually access your windows file system
technology,not_removed,im buying a thinkpad after a few diy upgrades im looking at under for a quadcore nvidia its a work laptop its fast enough for cad of ram a ssd and best of all a adobergb display with internal hardware calibration meanwhile my rmbp has weird color issues and i cant be bothered to buy a second calibrator to fix it license
technology,not_removed,i would rather have the battery life of windowsmacos on my linux laptop
technology,not_removed,was thinking the same thing everyone seems to have completely missed that
technology,not_removed,linux users love pointless hyperbole
technology,not_removed,they glue the batteries into the machines now and theyre honestly not built to last more than five years
technology,not_removed,the point is that running osx on nonapple hardware is a real hassle so you kind of have to switch software if you want different hardware
technology,not_removed,what if i was to tell you that there are devices outside of cameras that utilize sd cards
technology,not_removed,dudehook up your camera with the damn usb cable have you actually tried downloading of raw images through the connection on many dslrs go ahead ill wait because its going to be a long fucking time source own a with lens anyway camera
technology,not_removed,its just a stupid oversight for a pro computer to not have an sd card slot carrying a usbc to sd card adapter is just one more fucking thing you have to keep up with in your kit busy professionals shouldnt have to worry about that kind of shit sd card slots have been standard on mbps since at least the aluminum unibody model the same is true for the lack of a single usb slot sure usbc is most likely the future but its going to be years before everyone is finished converting starting with the retina mbp the laptops have been thinner than anyone needs out of a high performance laptop they sacrificed userreplaceable hard drives and ram features that actually matter to professionals for the sake of being thinner ive carried a mac laptop since the powerbook and i dont see myself ever buying another mac
technology,not_removed,oled screens still have the problem of leds fading something like the top menu bar on macos would be quickly burned into the top of the screen
technology,not_removed,they havent been interested in the pro market since the iphone they abandoned shake one of the most popular compositors at the time that was the first sign then they made fcs a prosumer piece of software the new mac pro was actually a pretty great direction to take it but its now generations out of date
technology,not_removed,thinkpad better made than the adobergb screen loads of hardware upgradability and really inexpensive rebates on rebates on rebates
technology,not_removed,pixel is absolutely my next phone cant wait to build my pc and get off the bandwagon funny thing is ive always been too poor for apple but im kinda stuck in it because of work i think its about time to force a change in the tide
technology,not_removed,what improvement does the surfacebook have over the new mbp last i saw their top tier video card was worse and they are also capped at ram
technology,not_removed,but i can always fire up a linux vm on my surface book if i need to do something with a nix system or start the bash
technology,not_removed,but isnt that what air and macbook is for for people who dont care about specs they know who prefer mbp and they shouldve known they wouldnt be able to attract their mbp users with mbp
technology,not_removed,or hell get a fancy ubuntu laptop with f keys
technology,not_removed,very possible
technology,not_removed,funny you say that i dont have a plan yet but if i do end up making the switch it will probably be for a thinkpad too my current machine will last me a few more years anyway but im really not loving the direction apple is going steve is definitely spinning in his grave right now
technology,not_removed,youre hyped about a laptop with of ram barely hours of battery life and no usb ports or sd card slot really
technology,not_removed,what do you mean – insists that you use every program also any program forces you to use it exactly the way it was designed the distinction is usually that apple software has less options programmed in than linux or windows software and by overengineered – which parts would you like to be less engineered
technology,not_removed,just another mindless antiapple troll who has no idea what hes talking about the original powerbook ibook tipowerbook aluminum powerbook the original unibody macbook pros ect were all insanely ahead of their time in almost every way possible hardware design io bto options ect
technology,not_removed,heck you can just download ubuntu gnome instead of the standard one
technology,not_removed,im using mate continuation of gnome its been well maintained which distros are using it
technology,not_removed,im using mate too it works pretty well indeed
technology,not_removed,fedora checking in we exist too
technology,not_removed,mate master race here no joke i get an additional hours of battery life on my laptop using mate over gnome and thats with compositing enabled
technology,not_removed,i was very impressed with opensuse leap when i tried it a little while ago kde and plasma looks great and very traditional of course mint with cinnamon is also quite spiffy but still you cant hide that its linux to install skype i had to go look up documentation and then install rpms manually theres too much stuff like that still on windows just install the exe and it adds what needs adding no muss no fuss want dual or triple screens plug in the screens and arrange what order you want them in linux is still a pain in the butt when you want to do something quite frequently
technology,not_removed,how well does it work for hidpi and multiple monitors any improvements lately
technology,not_removed,years ago when i first heard about ubuntu it actually used gnome as the default interface why they changed it
technology,not_removed,i havent used linux a whole ton but i am definitely a kde fan
technology,not_removed,everyone knows that is the best desktop environment combine that with using vim for all editing and have everything inside a tmux session and remapping your capslock key to ctrl and vice versa and making a short tap on your new ctrl key be an escape as wellproductivity through the roof and the best thing of all nobody else can use your computer because they get so frustrated trying to figure out how it works that they leave you alone win win
technology,not_removed,i want a pantheon spin of fedora so badly
technology,not_removed,thats what ive always done but that fucking touch bar is a nonstarter i use functionesc keys every few seconds the only option is the inch pro which has slow old off the shelf hardware i mean fuck apple its as if theyre trying to drive customers away
technology,not_removed,arent the complaints surrounding hardware though
technology,not_removed,but that doesnt help the people in the article they are leaving macos because the hardware is disappointing not the os
technology,not_removed,thats because you have autism
technology,not_removed,bad link formatting
technology,not_removed,mike krahulik from penny arcade actually tested a prototype and betatested the production version apparently hes been loving his for months
technology,not_removed,surface studios are even more expensive than the imac and are also somewhat underpowered
technology,not_removed,photoshop has some ludicrously crazy awesome features if you can figure out how to use them the gimp doesnt have a skin blending engine cooked in
technology,not_removed,gimp just isnt easy to use even if you know it i was doing something in photoshop last night for the first time in months and probably the most complicated thing ive done in over a year after about minutes of confusion due to trying to do things the gimp way which i use at work all the time for editing photos since i dont have photoshop the photoshop workflow came rushing back and i remembered why gimp just sucks
technology,not_removed,i wouldnt trust crossoverwine for anything professional as a developer im fine with ubuntu but as a designer id rather run windows
technology,not_removed,will be the year of linux no doubt
technology,not_removed,the colorspace management advantages macos has will probably keep pros from leaving
technology,not_removed,crossoverwine runs photoshop on linux photoshop is already a shitshow on windows god forbid you try to do raw video for other things like drawing and vectors there are great linux tools for that blender krita inkscape blender works pretty well but inkscape really isnt in the same league especially given all the integration
technology,not_removed,i dont get pressure sensitivity on those
technology,not_removed,most of the gamut of people who will be buying those new macs will be im not bashing linux excuse the pun but the article is bullshit in terms of jumping ship to linux windows on the other hand
technology,not_removed,hi creative director at a decent sized agency here and heavily involved in the creative agency industry photoshop is the defacto standard in our industry other tools are used yes but its very rare to find a photoshopfree team
technology,not_removed,linux tends to work rather well on macs its a single piece of hardware used by many people so theres lots of people who make sure that everything works nicely theres also not too few developers who buy macbooks just to put linux on them
technology,not_removed,but a mac is a pc
technology,not_removed,why not
technology,not_removed,and ive tried them all day to day osx is just more comfortable to work in as an admin basically everything else i do save for gaming is done under linux but my workflow is simply easier under osx my fingers feel more comfortable
technology,not_removed,i dont like hanging on to them too long after apple care expires because of common issues these things have since they are now virtually non selfrepairable outside of minor things
technology,not_removed,the new bash on windows is spectacular i ran my companies entire backend locally on it need to for development and it worked great but yeah after using os x for the past years i cant stomach how horrible the windows ui is is an improvement over no doubt but the font lack of gestures total and utter lack of standards for application ui its just worse
technology,not_removed,eh i mean sure theyve progressed but they still all have common problems too worse displays worse trackpads or just a lack of gesture support due to windows oem installed bloatware and then theres just the stability of os x vs windows again ill put this more into the opinion category but as an avid fan and user of the surface lineup and heavy user of both oses ive had a lot more trouble with stability on windows than i have on os x i even think this is perfectly fair though windows has to run on a lot more hardware an infinite number of hardware configurations really so you end up with a bunch of funky problems particularly when youre upgrading to a new os the benefit to this scenario though is that theres a lot more hardware competition in the windows hardware ecosystem so youre not paying for a machine with of ram usually
technology,not_removed,i did spend mac kind of money i got hit with the famous vista ram problem along with a lot of driver troubles with my sound network and graphics drivers it was a disaster
technology,not_removed,i use optimallayout httpmostadvantageouscomoptimallayout there also others spectacle is open source for example httpswwwspectacleappcom another paid app is moom httpsmanytrickscommoom
technology,not_removed,i kind of miss setting up linux and customizing it i find that all really fun but at the same time i like how apple hands you something unix like that is all gift wrapped and easily maintained from the get go i dont know i would probably be quite happy to go back to linux as my main os but i would just miss the polish of osx
technology,not_removed,macosx may be more polished but only for what apple wants you to do the ui general set has be feeling like im wadding through syrup the obsolesce of macs can be annoying my mac wouldnt last this long unless it was running linux while people say macosx has great hardware support only for mac stuff lots of stuff basic need drivers its easier experience running linux on a mac than macosx on a non mac like the new fell xps or chromebooks buy linux software sbd its excellent beyond that just switch to various programs blender krita inkscape etc
technology,not_removed,linux is a flaming pain in the ass with poor support for less used chipset issues like battery management mac osx works really well though it has some issues with enterprise file systems which i dont deal with that said im actually not that fond of the gui i liked my lxde setup better because im a freak and if linux had similar battery life and ran adobe software id be using it
technology,not_removed,not true when youre in the linux environment you can access your windows drives from under the mnt folder your c drive is located at mntc and your d drive is located at mntd for example
technology,not_removed,no it is literally the ubuntu file system on top of windows once you mount the c drive you have ubuntu with no walls
technology,not_removed,my is reaching the end of its life span what you list there sounds like a good candidate for engineering software hadnt heard of the until this thread thanks do you know how it compares to the dell precision and the hp last time i made this decision it came down to those
technology,not_removed,how do you know asshole you dont speak for me
technology,not_removed,i give you a point for the batteries my year old mac book pro barely lasted two hours under regular use however everything else ran smoothly
technology,not_removed,thanks for the precision i was mentioning old boxes with removable batteries one imac flower power model still in use for music sequences mostly old software installed on it max csound bolprocessor etc a now defunct powerbook which lasted from till a mac mini hard disk replaced by ssd and ram added ibook two imacs and still rocking obviously thats enough for what i do on it nothing heavy mostly terminal programming browsing and experimental music
technology,not_removed,then what if you got a sd card reader
technology,not_removed,i mean out of curiosity name some im not defending it but i dont think anything beyond my camera and my phone use an sd card
technology,not_removed,tbf most machines wearing the pro moniker dont have full sized sd slots
technology,not_removed,different strokes for different folks my connects via wifi and the docking station ill have in my studio has all the ports and sd slots i need with one connection that is also powering my laptop my current workflow requires five plugs that a single breakout box with a single cable will now take care of ymmv as always
technology,not_removed,i agree the last good pro device by apple was the mac pro but at entry level it was a tough buy
technology,not_removed,ditto the may be a little hefty but you get top notch everything plus you can play around with cuda plus running on it can net you a good hrs of battery although i code in terminal through ssh which is pretty lightweight
technology,not_removed,this ive used one with xeon and ram this is better than some of the old servers running in the colo i may try the as on a i have to adjust the dpi which still gives me tons of screen real estate but im hoping i can see on a at to feet away
technology,not_removed,ive got one but its i love it but i wasnt aware it came in hidpi
technology,not_removed,also chink government spyware installed in the hardware firmware
technology,not_removed,the performance base model uses a
technology,not_removed,the surface book allows removing the screen from the keyboard so that the screen can be used as a tablet it also has a touch sensitive screen i dont like the fact that i cant upgrade the ram or hard drive on a surface book but im okay with the justification ms gives for that fact the surface book is an insanely powerful laptop that is also a bad ass tablet with mediocre battery life the new macbook pro line is full of laptops that are needlessly thin while sacrificing upgrade ability and they dont have a touch sensitive screen ill probably keep reading books on my ipad but i wont buy another mac product again
technology,not_removed,the surface book was released over a year ago and the surface book is a laptoptablet hybrid so not a very good comparison there and with it being over a year old already id still buy it before id purchase the mbp purely on functionality and productivity
technology,not_removed,i think ive used the sd card slot twice and it has four usb ports
technology,not_removed,im not going to lie id kill for that battery life on my laptop i get a measly but hey getting work done faster is worth charging my laptop a bit more frequently p
technology,not_removed,wait do we have battery numbers yet i thought there arent any out yet
technology,not_removed,i like the forward thinking iirc its rated for but i usually am plugged in somewhere there are usb ports and i already have a few usb type c devices ready to use em and a nice breakout adapter to dock into that gives me every port i need ill be going from five plugs to one via my lg i do branding ui ux photo editing and post and light web development my current machine has and quite frankly i doubt i use much more than unless im really punishing my machine with raw files even then i rarely use more than by the time i need im sure theyll be a configuration out that either has fast enough of an ssd that ram is near meaningless or ill just go buy the model and sell the late
technology,not_removed,people still use sd cards arent those slots rather slow
technology,not_removed,youre hyped about a laptop with of ram barely hours of battery life and no usb ports or sd card slot really well my firewire sd reader was way faster than the builtin sd slot soooo im excited for an apple laptop with no proprietary ports but disappointed about the ram and keyboard
technology,not_removed,jesus christ for such a laptop
technology,not_removed,and which year was this if you tell me after im just going to continue laughing
technology,not_removed,linux mint main distro uses it its an offshoot of ubuntu
technology,not_removed,the major distros ubuntu opensuse fedora debian fedora opensuse and ubuntu offer preinstalled desktops if you want it prebuilt instead of a manual download through the software centre
technology,not_removed,mate here too its not as pretty as elementary but its super stable
technology,not_removed,fedora says yes my job sucks but the nasdaq pays developers really well
technology,not_removed,mate huh that looks pretty nice
technology,not_removed,want dual or triple screens plug in the screens and arrange what order you want them in i could understand your comment if you were using one of the more barebones desktop environments but you were using kde it works exactly like that on kde
technology,not_removed,there are some programs for installing programs automatically is rpmsdebs like installing exes when i did that on ubuntu which uses deb instead of rpm a prompt saidwould you like to install this and installed everything required no mess no fuss the prompt was from a program called gdebigtk otherwise known as the gdebi packagesoftware installer fedora linux has the yum extender yumex which works like the gdebi software installer downloads whats required when you install something i dont know about opensuses yet another setup tool which is used for managing software but last time i used it could only install software specifically made for it ymp no rpm note i think there should be a way to install things through the desktop in opensuse as fedora and ubuntu can do it but i lack the skills to even start it
technology,not_removed,theres been big improvements for hidpi in the latest version
technology,not_removed,i have run linux on some macbook airs and it has been a bit mixed the older the device the better it works i have a mba and the only problem with the hardware is i have to compile a custom driver for the backlight to work properly which is a pain
technology,not_removed,i had a migraine getting my mac to triple boot once that was done it was pretty painless to get the rest to work in all three oses backlight in ubuntu took a bit of effort
technology,not_removed,nope but if looks matter more then specs you can still use a macbook with linux the title is kinda weird its like saying the latest ford car is shit so ford owners are turning to cars
technology,not_removed,why did you make that deduction i dont have autism
technology,not_removed,if an imac is enough for the creatives a surface studio will be better
technology,not_removed,careful now dont mess up the native advertising
technology,not_removed,you are paying for support so if something goes wrong you have someone to contact if it breaks
technology,not_removed,keep it up and it will be
technology,not_removed,there are actually loads of great programs for linux but its a bit hit and miss if the tools you need are good
technology,not_removed,i hope you are right
technology,not_removed,how many times have we heard this its still more trouble than its worth to the vast majority of people
technology,not_removed,not as long as you have to hunt down rpms yourself to install skype or install crossoverwine to get software running or as long as games are all made for windows or as long as outlook and office connected to exchange rule the workplace
technology,not_removed,why use a linux knockoff like os x when you can use the real thing
technology,not_removed,most of the gamut of people who will be buying those new macs will be the article doesnt even mention photoshop at all as i suspect the photoshop users being a tiny minority to begin with nope the photoshop excuse is the same old tired antilinux cliché ive been hearing about for years now even from people i suspect who dont even use photoshop to begin with windows on the other hand sure if they trust windows even many traditional windows users dont even trust windows will be the year of linux no doubt probably not but ill settle for to and i think thats realistic but keep up with the old excuses they are quite nostalgic
technology,not_removed,then a machine wouldnt be right for you and how big is your industry
technology,not_removed,fair enough i know a lot of folks who have macbooks for that reason that said theyre getting sticker shock too
technology,not_removed,yeah but youre not forced to upgrade right away just because your warranty is expired doesnt mean the machine is bad i mean the thing is going to last several years anyway so whats the point in getting it right when it launches i guess if you buy one a couple months before a new ones launches youre screwed but you dont languish a car purchase just because a new one is going to come out next year apples website actually states that they expect your computer to last years i dont know about you but i start putting away for my new computer about a year until applecare expires then if my computer dies months after and its not cheap to fix then i can expect not to pay an arm and a leg more than expected if it lasts years then im ready to buy and if it lasts longer then i get an even better computer than i needed or a new ipad
technology,not_removed,same i switched to mac in first i tried to make the mac more windowslike and now its the other way around if the explorer would be gone and more opensource apps available i could be tempted the surface studio also looks very sexy though then again seeing those yellow folder icons and the giant toolbar just makes me sick when i try to work with it i am missing a proper workspace that they added variants of favorites to the sidebar didnt make it any easier and the newnew start menu basically buried all the apps in tiny scroll area and now suggest me to buy odd variants of mobile games smh
technology,not_removed,the problem i have with your statement in the first line is that it depends sure with apple the equipment is simplified but i can buy any display trackpad or clean install stability i think has gotten much better so saying worse like that but acknowledging the customization one can do is weird
technology,not_removed,worse displays surface and most top end devices have surpassed retina to the point where i keep wondering if apple will release retina worse trackpads or just a lack of gesture support due to windows windows has supported gestures in a premium way since those gestures are on par with mac and that is at the os level not all oems support it but every device i suggested does oem installed bloatware thats why you always buy microsoft certified devices then theres just the stability of os x vs windows in my experience working with both oss el capitan is far less stable that windows with anniversary update
technology,not_removed,hmm well i suppose i could use those really hope apple considers adding window snapping and other window management features in the next macos iteration most linux desktops have those features as well so it just seems so odd for macos to not have them
technology,not_removed,tried it out i have guess what happens when you start accessing files on the windows drive
technology,not_removed,it will corrupt files if you access the windows drive for example i used vim to edit my windows host file and now the file is corrupted
technology,not_removed,the precision has ecc ram xeon processors and better graphics cards optional if you want to run vms its king its also twice the price i cant speak for the hp if you need a pretty good laptop which blows away the new rmbp and have buy the rthinkpad decribes it as thinkpad durable which is sort of the holy grail of laptop construction
technology,not_removed,wow calm down cranky boy go do a nice calming gentoo install
technology,not_removed,i had some of the older macs and they were rather rugged machines of great reliability the new ones are not quite so sensible in their construction and even premium products like thinkpads offer a lot more power for a lot less money if it works it works but i would not want to own my rmbp at five years of age heck im a bit nervous about it at three
technology,not_removed,good readers are expensive and its one more thing to keep around not userfriendly
technology,not_removed,players audio recorders electronic music instruments such as the new korg electribes
technology,not_removed,good question i see sd slots as camera slots i once used sds for nintendo wii and psp but nothing else beyond that i have android devices that have them but frankly using dropbox or google drive is much more convenient to exchange apks and whatnot
technology,not_removed,the beauty of the macbook pro line used to be that you could get real work done while out in the field the wifi connectivity to your camera is pretty much useless unless youre in your studio all of the needs youve described would be served by a nice desktop sitting in your studio i use my mbp to record music in remote settings i need a laptop that is powerful and reasonably portable with a reasonable selection of ports i also want the ability to upgrade my laptops ram and hard drive i dont give a fuck about how thin my laptop is if i could do my work on a thin laptop i would look closely at the macbook air my year old powerbook is as thin as a pro laptop should be fuck if someone could make a thinner laptop but then use a larger battery to keep the laptop around of an inch thick while retaining the ability to upgrade the hard drive and ram id be really happy
technology,not_removed,i hate our mac pro at work mostly because when im not working on that im stuck with our shitty beat to hell year old imac because instead of building powerhouses we blew a load on one
technology,not_removed,my rmbp battery went kaput after less than two years i just want a second battery
technology,not_removed,arent the pascal series inside of laptops already they should be almost twice as efficient also i believe given cpu goes inside the screen it will be severely watered down and under powered given the heat constraints
technology,not_removed,yeah but its definitely a crappy tablet experience
technology,not_removed,in my experience surfaces are indeed nice laptops but definitely not badass tablets
technology,not_removed,honestly if youre just buying it for the touchscreen youre wasting your money the stylus and its capabilities in addition to the tablet mode is what sells it creators will pay a ton just to get their creative workflow more efficient and that portable digital drawing tablet is killer
technology,not_removed,its too under powered to be a laptop and too bigheavy to be a good tablet pass
technology,not_removed,ah see i couldnt care less about the touch screen same for the touch bar on the new mac my biggest problem with the new mac is the keyboard i fucking hate low key travel and i think the surface book has the same problem just with worse specs
technology,not_removed,usb ports but without separate port for charging hdmi out ethernet and sd slot
technology,not_removed,no it has ports which can also be used as usb ports
technology,not_removed,you are way too quick to justify losing features that should be a given at the price point we are talking about i fully understand you like the ecosystem and as do i but think logically about what youre saying
technology,not_removed,my issue with apple is the screen i dont know if i have a dud but it has some weird color cast issues that make it unsuitable even for basic photo work without proper hardware calibration im replacing it with a thinkpad the optional dock is but its still much cheaper and doesnt require me to replace my used with a brand new thunderbolt display
technology,not_removed,you could do all of that on a machine thats cheaper
technology,not_removed,my new digital camera uses sd card i dont know if there are cameras with any other options
technology,not_removed,galaxy still uses sd cards lots of folks still use them and many are and bigger
technology,not_removed,modern sd is fast and its extremely common a lot of video is done to sd cards
technology,not_removed,id say use a reader but youre gonna want an adapter
technology,not_removed,i think thats our the configuration with the ssd
technology,not_removed,once again you are proving you know literally nothing about the apple lineup or the history of the hardware but for some reason still insist on acting like an expert literally all of the items i listed came out before with the exception of the original unibody mbp which i think came out in if you had any idea what you were talking about you woulda have known that
technology,not_removed,its upstream is debian now
technology,not_removed,thanks for the tip i have been using xfce since i dislike where gnome has gone ill have to look into mate thx
technology,not_removed,mate is sold as the more stable linux anyway right
technology,not_removed,is rpmsdebs like installing exes slightly to closer to msi only an rpmdeb will likely not include all the dependencies within the file but will contain a list of all required packages that should be installed along side it the extreme of this are metapackages that have no program files in them at all for example if you install a kubuntudesktop deb on a normal ubuntu system gdebisynapticwhatever will download the hundreds of megabytes of other packages needed to provide the full kde desktop environment
technology,not_removed,i wonder how useful a touchbar is gonna be if someone tries to run another os on their new mbp
technology,not_removed,i didnt say it was less powerful than the imac i said it was underpowered considering the intended use and the high price
technology,not_removed,in comparison to photoshop gimp is worse in just about every way it is a poorly designed program there is the major issues like not supporting lab and cmyk colour spaces it is all the stupid little shit like the clunkiness of the type tool how pasting a selection doesnt create a new layer but rather a pasted selection how clicking inside the window will bring up the last used tool no i just finished with levels why the fuck would i want it again etc yes it is nice that it is free and provides all these features but it doesnt excuse it from being a terribly designed program there is no excuse for not fixing it by now there is other great open source graphicsediting software out there inkscape and darktable come to mind none of them quite match the professional equivalent but they are decent unfortunately there is nothing that acceptably replaces photoshop
technology,not_removed,thats nice for things like games where if something doesnt work you have recourse with professional tasks i cant just wait and hope for a patch
technology,not_removed,hey network well have to push back the airdate because i need to call support to get avid mc running on wine through ubuntu
technology,not_removed,see if tools are okay in current state have company hire a programmer or two for open source contributions to the toolchain you need profit enough companies do that tools will stop being a problem very quickly theyll even be able to get patches really fast and have custom features added
technology,not_removed,which is why im so in love with xserverubunutu for windows no more dual booting or running a vm to run the must have programs
technology,not_removed,to install skype go to skypes homepage and download skype for ubuntu skype download for ubuntu when download is finished go to the download folder where you downloaded sype right click on the skypepackage you downloaded and click on open with ubuntu software center after that this window should open so so hard
technology,not_removed,as opposed to hunting down exes to install skype on windows
technology,not_removed,skype if you use ubuntu mate lts you can install it with a little as clicks right from
technology,not_removed,yaourt skype
technology,not_removed,both are derived from unix actually
technology,not_removed,youre missing his point badly the kinds of people who buy mbp notebooks are the type of people who use photoshop or pro tools or premiere or some other software that doesnt have a good linux counterpart those users might be a tiny majority of all users but theyre a majority of the people who buy expensive professional notebooks those people arent moving to linux anytime soon because the software isnt there also widespread linux is already here its on a majority of smart phones most people dont care or know any more than they know theyve got a samsung or something like that
technology,not_removed,the digital marketing industry is currently worth billion and rapidly growing especially in the creativedesign front
technology,not_removed,its just a meme lad
technology,not_removed,oh im not sure im going to update hardware this time around i have a top of the line last rev mbp and a perfectly capable imac both work machines massively overpowered for of what i throw at it anything heavy goes onto my underdesk vmcontainer box at home its a hackintoshwindowslinux box and another linux virtcontainer server i just really like the os man their key combo game is on point
technology,not_removed,ive had image retention problems with my imac and apparently the issue is very common with retina imacs screens cost dollars on ebay so i was thinking abit about selling it before apple care expires just to be safe i was hoping they would announce new mac pros or even minis with but sadly no dice
technology,not_removed,there is no point continuing this because clearly we just have different opinions neither of us are wrong we just have different experiences if you like windows so much im glad and you should continue to enjoy using it i enjoy windows and my surface but i strongly prefer osx and will keep using that
technology,not_removed,yup btw a new hidden feature in sierra is double clicking the edge of a window to maximize in that direction
technology,not_removed,worked fine for me
technology,not_removed,that seems to be the consensus after some googling for you cannot beat that hell i paid for the years ago ram though
technology,not_removed,i also had a thinkpad ibm by that time i was wondering wether or not lenovo matches ibm machines quality especially in their higher range products but you seem to give a hint
technology,not_removed,it is one more thing to keep around but i havent had any trouble with usb readers they are the same speed as the internal reader on a macbook
technology,not_removed,printers
technology,not_removed,only one of those isnt improved upon with an iphone and thats better off over bluetooth
technology,not_removed,the beauty of the macbook pro line used to be that you could get real work done while out in the field the wifi connectivity to your camera is pretty much useless unless youre in your studio all of the needs youve described would be served by a nice desktop sitting in your studio not at all the can act as a adhoc network and i can pull images that way however i actually will have a great little mobile breakout box in my bag anyway just in case i also want the ability to upgrade my laptops ram and hard drive i dont think a mac is for you then nothing wrong with having your needs i dont give a fuck about how thin my laptop is if i could do my work on a thin laptop i would look closely at the macbook air i do i need the power of the macbook pro but every pound saved is great my year old powerbook is as thin as a pro laptop should be fuck if someone could make a thinner laptop but then use a larger battery to keep the laptop around of an inch thick while retaining the ability to upgrade the hard drive and ram id be really happy usb type c power allows for external power batteries not as elegant as having it attached but if you need hours its possible for me its not worth the weight i work from coffee shops and co working spaces with plenty of access to power anyway
technology,not_removed,yeah well thats not really apples problem that your boss is cheap and reckless with their money
technology,not_removed,im stuck with our shitty beat to hell year old imac youre lucky i needed to use year old imac at my previous work place characters were appearing on the screen couple of seconds later and scrolling on sites like stackoverflow was lets say interesting
technology,not_removed,i wouldnt call having a full desktop os a crappy tablet experience i love my surface way more than my ipad and most of the time i dont have a keyboard connected to it
technology,not_removed,its great with a pen
technology,not_removed,mike krahulik of penny arcade was actually asked to come in and test some prototype surface stuff and he says its amazing an alternative even to wacoms best im not sure who at microsoft decided to retrace apples rise to creative industry success step by step but it seems to be working
technology,not_removed,unless you want a drawingart tablet as far as i can tell nothing comes close until you hit doubletriple the price
technology,not_removed,i have a surface pro and the key travel is way better on that than in the macbook id imagine its even better on the surface book
technology,not_removed,it charges with the same cable i use for my monitor am i the only one that sees that as a benefit oh and i also hate adapters too btw but i feel not as burned by this because i mainly use my computers for audio i know i have a dock that everything is connected to and simply is connected to my computer with one cable if you hate socks i can see why youd hate it but some decked out tb docks are pretty friggin awesome
technology,not_removed,but all of those can go into one dock because of thunderbolt
technology,not_removed,its the other way around they are usbc ports it uses thunderbolt by way of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiusbtypecalternatemodepartnerspecifications
technology,not_removed,nah i like the idea of future devices being usb type c universally and i like apple kinda pushing the industry ahead a bit i have no problems with a breakout box the price of the macbook pro or having to buy a few new cables for my idevices shrug i understand and respect that other people have an issue with it maybe sales will be terrible and apple will pivot for the first time but this is the ethernet jack superdrive floppy disk removal of yesteryear im sure it will survive
technology,not_removed,think logically about what youre saying fukn lol
technology,not_removed,the deltae on apple screens are usually epic out of he box you might have a dud did you use a spectrophotometer to calibrate
technology,not_removed,i prefer the apple ecosystem to each their own im sensitive to the price issue for others but it really isnt a big deal for my personalprofessional budget
technology,not_removed,even the thought of giving up the trackpad is too much i might just give my air a clean install
technology,not_removed,cf cards compact flash high speed low storage cards
technology,not_removed,people still have digital cameras
technology,not_removed,why would i want an adapter when i can just use a usb cable
technology,not_removed,youre the only one raging here im just laughing at your incompetence thinking that anything that apple has on the market is revolutionary after the
technology,not_removed,oh i remember they came out with the debian edition have they completely switched switched over to that now and cut canonical out of the picture now i guess being the point none the less you should still get along with it just as well as ubuntu still which youll find plenty of info on if youre not familiar making it great beginner distro
technology,not_removed,its not sold
technology,not_removed,unless there is a firmware default mode that simply sends the corresponding function keys it will be a while before someone reverse engineers the driver so that it works on linux
technology,not_removed,what intended use did you have in mind as a graphic designer studio should be just fine for what i need to do this isnt meant to be used by editors or artists who may need more gpu power but i dont think studio is marketing itself towards that demographic
technology,not_removed,as you guys have said its free it doesnt have the funding that photoshop has of course photoshop is better
technology,not_removed,the crossover team makes sure to test the programs each release to make sure it all works
technology,not_removed,distributed software architecture by consensus done by a bunch of midlevel devs i can see that working swimmingly
technology,not_removed,didnt microsoft drop support for skype on linux and isnt it basically a dysfunctional piece of shit now
technology,not_removed,i used fedora fulltime at work ill probably switch back to fedora on a dell xps but its not as easy as that sounds the skype rpms pull in a bunch of outdated dependencies i once literally couldnt remove it because it somehow tried to bring systemd along with it screensharing is awful and very low quality text is unreadable the dbus support is wonky sometimes it would show notifications properly and let me control it through tools like the gnome shell extension for the most part it would simply crash at random intervals while keeping the tray icon and id miss important messages during a distrofedup upgrade id always end up with a broken skype or a broken os thanks to skype package management on linux is still awful but hopefully flatpak fixes these issues in the future honestly the only way you can use linux in a business environment is to keep a windows vm running there are too many stupid issues
technology,not_removed,thats not always true on linux depends on distro and the like and what linux users and a old woman for example for whom computers are a mystery considers hard differs quite a bit installing a distro and using whats there is easy enough adding new stuff can sometimes be a massive pain in the ass not that windows is great either mind you
technology,not_removed,on windows i think there is another thing i cant explain the fake exe which does nothing but downloads the real exe so yeah in order to get a fullyfunctional installation package you really have to hunt a bit sometimes
technology,not_removed,youre missing his point badly on the contrary i think you are i was addressing to him the same old tired excuses ive heard for years used by the proprietary usage fanboys maybe he should have used a more rational argument like yours instead of resorting to that tired old nonsense the kinds of people who buy mbp notebooks are the type of people who use photoshop or pro tools or premiere or some other software that doesnt have a good linux counterpart the article doesnt mention any of that for people into doing those sorts of things they would stick with an apple machine anyway and i doubt any of those people will jump into buying a machine without checking out what its capabilities are beforehand i assume theyre smart enough to do so hmm no the article seems to focus more on users that would be one step below that those in the price range and below and if you bothered to read it it also said obviously we arent comparing apples to apples pun intended if you absolutely need macos for certain software or licenses an ubuntu machine will not meet your needs also the machine does not have apples revolutionary touch bar also widespread linux is already here its on a majority of smart phones and this article has nothing to do with phones so once again it is you whove absolutely missed the point badly come back when youve read the article
technology,not_removed,how many machines thereabouts a few hundred a couple of thousand
technology,not_removed,im sorely tempted to build a hackintosh for my next desktop i really do like the operating system the hardware not so much
technology,not_removed,mac repairs are easier than theyre billed as ive completely disassembled my mba and it wasnt hard at all if you can change a water pump on a chevy nova you can swap a keyboardmobo on a mac
technology,not_removed,fair enough but i would like to point out based on the checklist above your opinions are stuck half a decade in the past btw i switch between osx and windows daily because of my line of work the same work that has me constantly playing with new devices im not bias i like both but your ideas of windows machines are dated
technology,not_removed,edit a file and open it in windows corrupts the files on my system
technology,not_removed,if you arent picky about your display or add your own ram you can get a with the future is here and it doesnt have a lot of hard disk paging
technology,not_removed,thinkpads kinda went downhill for a while but some of the newer ones are back to the old standards heavy metal frames under the plastic big cooling systems and removable batteries yeah it has the weight of a laptop but it has all the advantages too
technology,not_removed,the beauty of the macbook pro line used to be that you could get real work done while out in the field the wifi connectivity to your camera is pretty much useless unless youre in your studio all of the needs youve described would be served by a nice desktop sitting in your studio not at all the can act as a adhoc network and i can pull images that way however i actually will have a great little mobile breakout box in my bag anyway just in case if youre using your as an adhoc wifi router its going to be far slower than plugging an sd card into the fucking slot that has been standard on macbook pros for over a decade and again youre citing a piece of equipment that professionals shouldnt have to keep up with for plugging their sd card into a pro laptop i also want the ability to upgrade my laptops ram and hard drive i dont think a mac is for you then nothing wrong with having your needs oh fuck you ive been really happy with mac laptops for over years apple used to make really high quality laptops in the macbook pro line that were really easy to upgrade everything is soldered to the motherboard now for the sake of making the laptop thinner at the expense of the ability to ever upgrade the laptop i do i need the power of the macbook pro but every pound saved is great my year old powerbook is as thin as a pro laptop should be fuck if someone could make a thinner laptop but then use a larger battery to keep the laptop around of an inch thick while retaining the ability to upgrade the hard drive and ram id be really happy i dont think your weight savings on a thinner mbp matter at all when you have to carry an adapter to plug your phone into your laptop and an adapter to plug an sd card into your pro laptop saving a pound or two on the weight of a laptop is massively outweighed by having to carry extra adapters for any professional that travels constantly
technology,not_removed,no definitely not might be time for a few changes haha
technology,not_removed,the new ceo who took over in satya nadella after ballmer left has been absolutely on point hes the one to credit for most of microsofts directional pivots
technology,not_removed,from his blog post on the studio tycho asked me to compare it to my cintiq and i told him that drawing on the cintiq now felt like drawing on a piece of dirty plexiglass hovering over a crt monitor from
technology,not_removed,this if you draw on a screen you dont likely need that much power a surface book on a stand with a second display is going to let you draw stuff very effectively at home and abroad someone at ms decided that capturing the creative market was paramount to becoming cool if this is how theyre going about it more power to em
technology,not_removed,the stylus on the surface pro kind of sucks for art though compare it to an apple pencil or wacom now if the stylus was better i would agree
technology,not_removed,does the surface book have that weird plasticmesh keyboard thing
technology,not_removed,so now you need to buy an additional dock for a pro laptop that starts from
technology,not_removed,so i can drag my dock to meetings guys imma need to whip out my dock dave youre fired
technology,not_removed,i like the future of usb type c but the future is when all devices have that same connector and no dongle is required in the mean time two c ports two type a ports sd card and mini display port out is pro let the inch macbook be the pioneer like how the air eschewed the cd drive but keep the pro a true pro machine it was only until generations after the air did the pro lose the cd drive the pro needs to work with whatever i need it to work it not the other way around
technology,not_removed,this is the ethernet jack superdrive floppy disk removal of yesteryear the floppy drive was already on its way out but they jumped the gun cd burners eased the sting and usb storage killed it in a few years but everyone had usb floppies for ages the optical drive was already viable loading things via network was incredibly common and external optical drives on apple laptops go back ages ethernet was honestly a bit stupid wifi at the time wasnt up to snuff and losing hardware ports makes a lot of pro stuff configuring networks for example a pain especially considering the usb adapter was crap i had one
technology,not_removed,a printer actually all my prints are weird my galaxy was actually used for a lastminute hailmary adjustment and was more accurate
technology,not_removed,i like apple myself i stick to iphones and have a macbook air as my personal device granted i have the model and i went mac because after long days of fucking with computers i dont want to come home and fuck with a computer sorry linux but i find their price tags really hard to swallow sometimes
technology,not_removed,as a dev ive always loved apples build quality but this isnt a pro machine designers might be able to make it work but i use f keys every or so seconds the mbp is a joke for programmers if youre not bound to iosos xxcode youre not likely looking at these systems anymore
technology,not_removed,it has a trackpad what are you talking about
technology,not_removed,full frame canon dslr use sd card
technology,not_removed,photographers
technology,not_removed,because most usb readers used with laptops just plug directly into the port
technology,not_removed,not literally sold as in for money but sold as in stability is touted as one of its main strengths
technology,not_removed,not as in but as a solution
technology,not_removed,or artists who may need more gpu power but i dont think studio is marketing itself towards that demographic they literally demod modelling on stage
technology,not_removed,open source advocates are often railing about how open source software is just as powerful as closed source hardware how the open source release has the vast majority of features from the proprietary equivalent so maybe somebody comes along and points out its shortcomings maybe you mention that it has no cmyk support doesnt have any sort of nondestructive editing capability a lot of filter operations cause loss of bit depth the paintbrush is a scaled raster bitmap using large brushes has incredibly poor performance no particular control over brush modifiers dealing with gradients is unintuitive nonsense filters only let you see a preview at zoom halfassed filters like a completely unusable lens flare presumably added as joke filters apply to the image and not to individual layers many filters lack any sort of customization as with lens flare lighting effects is unintuitive and entirely unusable and then all of a sudden its something like its free and doesnt have the funding of course it isnt as good well then people should stop saying it its that easy represent the capabilities of the product accurately and dont hold it up as a photoshop alternative and get all annoyed when people compare it to photoshop at best its a photoshop alternative for people who didnt need photoshop to begin with
technology,not_removed,sigh of course it wont have all the features but nothing says open source software cannot be designed well for general use gimp has also been missing critical features that people have been screaming for for years now and nobody seems to care to implement it i have praised other related software here that extolls exactly what im talking about
technology,not_removed,the crossover team makes sure to test the programs each release to make sure it all works if you believe that i have a clock in london to sell you
technology,not_removed,dysfunctional piece of shit sounds just like their windows app
technology,not_removed,people laugh and say that but i always preferred the old version linux has than the newest windows versions no ads more compact usage of screen space and was immune to the http null parsing crash
technology,not_removed,yes but now that web browsers bundle video calling functionality webrtc microsoft has decided to create a new version of skype for linux which is pretty much just a web browser this is currently still in alpha but seems to largely be usable
technology,not_removed,its always looked like shit too
technology,not_removed,a lot of that sounds like a shitty program not quite fedoras fault
technology,not_removed,in our entire industry jesus many i wouldnt know where to begin we have people at all have various macbooks well have more than a few in a few weeks but some of the assistants and managers dont need upgrades we dont have any desktops
technology,not_removed,aside from audio its gotten fairly foolproof to on the desktop just get a usb audio card and youre set
technology,not_removed,weird i was wondering if i was capable of servicing my mba and i have changed a water pump on a chevy celebrity before thanks for the encouragement
technology,not_removed,the macbook retinas are not so much fun to fix ive swapped parts on older macbooks but id rather not touch my retina also holy shit those screens cost a lot
technology,not_removed,my opinions are not stuck half a decade in the past lol but you can tell yourself that if it makes you feel like your opinion is more superior i guess
technology,not_removed,thanks for the feedback always good to know since their architecture was really compatible with uncommon os such as the bsd family and i plan to reinstall one of them in a not to far future perhaps compatibility still prevails nowadays
technology,not_removed,i think you are misunderstand me i am talking about my personal setup and hype for the computer not saying every professional should embrace it obviously everyone has different preferences and thats okay plenty of options out there im only speaking for my own professional workflow oh fuck you wow nice i love how the internet can really bring out absolute nastiness in people why are talking about a laptop that doesnt fit your needs if its not for you thats fine lots of laptops out there if you dont like apples direction vote with your wallet and take yur business elsewhere but dont insult me with personal attacks because im just stating the obvious youve communicated that the new macbook pro is not for you im communicating that i am a professional and i will be using it theres nothing wrong with that and you dont have to childishly attack me for that jesus i dont think your weight savings on a thinner mbp matter at all when you have to carry an adapter to plug your phone into your laptop and an adapter to plug an sd card into your pro laptop saving a pound or two on the weight of a laptop is massively outweighed by having to carry extra adapters for any professional that travels constantly adapter ill just have a single usb type c lightning cable and a type c charger i wont carry the legacy usb type a cable or charger at all no change there the satechi break out box with packaging is ounces i estimate the box itself will be plus i like thinness why are you so emotionally invested in my personal tastes i just want to dispel the myth that theres no professionals out there that want this laptop i have a feeling sales will be just fine
technology,not_removed,a dirty piece of plexiglas is an alternative not a particulary desirable alternative
technology,not_removed,they used a wacom digitizer did that change
technology,not_removed,as far as i know thats just a surface pro thing the surface book has a full standard laptop keyboard thats just removable
technology,not_removed,id be buying a dock anyway no laptop is going to have all the ports i need so theres no reason to try
technology,not_removed,at least your not buying an office suite on a subscription basis on a pro device back to your point youve had to buy adapters for anything for ages i recently found an ethernet to usb adapter from the
technology,not_removed,the way i use my mac now my dock is my thunderbolt display not sure what id need to bring to meetings even for projecting we just use miracast at this point
technology,not_removed,yeah id wager something is wrong there
technology,not_removed,although i owned a macbook i actually didnt make the full switch till i really took a hard look after a lifetime of building my own machines and running windows and tinkering it just wasnt worth my time the apple tax translates to so much time and frustration savings the fact that if something is wrong i can just walk into an apple store and say fix it and have so much extra time with my family is worth paying far more than what i pay for apple products
technology,not_removed,we have two in house devs one will be getting the new machine he was already used to holding the fn key to get access to that row i dont think he is anticipating any issues but maybe the workflows are different as a creative director that also produces designs i am about as professional as you can get handling ux and ui designs light front end development branding and photography i guess time will tell if sales take a nose dive on these models compared to prior models the naysayers will be proven right its certainly a possibility
technology,not_removed,i am a dev and will have zero issues with the new function key setup
technology,not_removed,i dont know what kind of programmer you are but as a programmer i really dont use fkeys that much to run the program sure but i think and write code far more than that
technology,not_removed,sorry i meant a good trackpad
technology,not_removed,uh i have this no sd card slot same with the too but i assume newer models have sd card slots
technology,not_removed,i was being kinda facetious but surely if youre a photographer whos buying a computer and presumably has a camera worth several thousand dollars you can afford a usbc sd card reader apple doesnt need to deal with the added complexity and additional possibilities of component failure that having an sd card slot would mean for a laptop
technology,not_removed,they still can
technology,not_removed,exactly as i mentioned in another comment i use photoshop as part of making a living for myself theres no way i could go without it theres not a chance i could do what i do with gimp even if i could theres no way itll be as time efficient in my eyes gimp is a upgrade to windows paint
technology,not_removed,exactly general use im using photoshop in part to make a living
technology,not_removed,no you arent reading ive covered exactly what i mean in the comment and given examples of good open source software
technology,not_removed,well it is and isnt fedoras fault ive run into a ton of proprietary apps that dont work well or are rarely updated the issue is that people package rpms that depend on system libraries that frequently change the solution is flatpak or snap but its early days for both technologies and we have two competing standards
technology,not_removed,machines lol ok so in relation to overall pc sales million this quarter its quite small now isnt it s my point being it wouldnt make a dent in the pc marketplace meaning whats right for your industry isnt necessarily right for everybody else and viceversa
technology,not_removed,httpswwwifixitcomdevicemacbookair one note you need to buy certain tools that you wont have laying around i like the ifixit kits but there are others out there as well you could even just buy the exact pentalobes drivers that you need without a kit
technology,not_removed,yeah i guess i should qualify that ive taken apart mbas and the old mbps i havent had a retina mbp apart so maybe theyve made them worse
technology,not_removed,they use pretty mainstream chipsets theyd rather throw money at intel and make sure shit works and theres a lot of development for thinkpads due to their popularity in it
technology,not_removed,i wrote fuck you in response to your comment about macs not being for me im the professional content creator that apple used to love apple has consistently fucked content creators by releasing shitty laptops that cant be upgraded since the mbp retina i used to defend apple against charges of being overpriced because their pro line of laptops was evenly priced against other pro offerings and was easy to upgrade apple has become the company of shitty overpriced hardware that dipshits used to say they were
technology,not_removed,no idea i tried out the one at the microsoft store and it sucked maybe they have different models
technology,not_removed,ill have to check it out when it gets in store thanks for the info im too lazy to look anything up
technology,not_removed,at least your not buying an office suite on a subscription basis on a pro device you do realize every mac shop in existence pays for ms office the exact same way
technology,not_removed,i once had a refurbished that i got from a reseller the phone didnt work i said fix it they said we cannot fix give us another for another iphone never again
technology,not_removed,i can just walk into an apple store and say fix it as i understand this is being significantly rolled back hope you got applecare
technology,not_removed,im sure some devs will stick with apple i dont think sublime makes heavy use of function keys i always map the fcn keys to be inverted so your dev could have been doing that all along if heshe needs to use those keys a lot i suspect theyll regret the move as a big fan of apple products up to this point im sure im not alone in being shocked by the pointlessness of several of their moves but i certainly dont think theyll lose all their customers in one product cycle nix is a strong draw and adobe being backwards asshats means linux isnt supported that will be a deal breaker for a lot of potential converts in terms of oses fedora knocks the wheels off os x but photoshop wont run on linux without some solutioning which will keep a lot of people away basically apple has become a bad tool among other bad tools
technology,not_removed,you mean lack of function keys there are no longer function keys
technology,not_removed,if you use an idesublime you may or may not use function keys i prefer vim with plugins terminal visor as light weight as possible basically i can be comfortable in any linux shell in a few minutes but i could code from one without changing anything if necessary i do web and mobile development so sometimes i have a lot of freedom sometimes im stuck in an ide android studio is ok i like the intellij version better than the old eclipse version xcode is a wretched monstrosity that should be murdered off immediately though
technology,not_removed,do you use an ide intellij makes use of f keys in its default bindings for example
technology,not_removed,highend nikons are moving over from cf to xqd some higherend canons have both cf and sd slots and the topend like the are cf card only sd simply isnt fast enough for that much camera
technology,not_removed,have sd card slots
technology,not_removed,lower end models have sd slots higher end models have cfast canon or xqd nikon
technology,not_removed,its really not about whether someone can or cannot afford sd card reader if the new imac didnt have sd card reader no problem the location of card reader is inconvenient anyway and a cheap sd card reader solves the issue no problem but this is a laptop we are talking about here laptop that needs number of dongles to be useful
technology,not_removed,oh dude for sure im not trying to assert that macs will take over they never ever will the world runs on linux and windows business mostly runs on windows the creative industries are uniquely macheavy thats about it
technology,not_removed,the was obviously talking about his team how would he know how many macbooks are in the digital marketing industry please put on your thinking cap
technology,not_removed,so to clarify what you are saying is that macs are no longer for you
technology,not_removed,what
technology,not_removed,i guess i meant buying new directly from apple
technology,not_removed,always for all my devices
technology,not_removed,there are function keys you just have to hit the fn key to get them that is perfectly fine for me
technology,not_removed,the new cards are pretty viable
technology,not_removed,xqd havent heard for that before a relative of mine used the canon have this rentacamera thing sometimes at events and he said he absolutely loved it
technology,not_removed,yeah ive only got the older models and a single slightly newer one the
technology,not_removed,why do you think it should be different for a laptop mac laptops dont have optical drives either and very few people seem to mind and this laptop only currently needs a number of dongles to be useful for a very specific subset of people
technology,not_removed,without cmyk it will not be a viable option for a professional designer it might be a small subset but also a very important subset of course they are free to prioritize as they wish
technology,not_removed,can i upvote this times
technology,not_removed,hey nothing wrong if people want to use macs for that sort of thing but a machine might be perfectly fine for people who dont do the kind of work that you do see my point
technology,not_removed,put on your thinking cap and imagine how those numbers stack up against overall pc sales the world doesnt revolve around what you or i or what he does theres a bigger overall picture than that if you bothered to open your eyes and skip the tunnel vision
technology,not_removed,yes macs are no longer for me and im pissed off about it apple has a long reputation as a company that makes overpriced crap and that reputation used to frustrate me because they made great products for content creators that honestly werent much more expensive than comparable products but offered better form factors without sacrificing connectivity their push to make the mbp as thin as possible drives me crazy and its the reason that i wont be buying another mac until they change course
technology,not_removed,mac offices use ms office they have a subscription from microsoft like every other corporation since forever
technology,not_removed,the typical give it all away democratic bullshit the fantasy of free yes down vote me you fucking clowns eventually youll grow the fuck up and realize the real world cant work with an endless parade of freebies someone has to pay for it all youre voting for is economic collapse brought to you by entitlements
technology,not_removed,this saying is generally miscredited and exists in multiple forms but regardless of origin the sentiment is correct a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy which is always followed by a dictatorship
technology,not_removed,ok run fiber optic infrastructure to every neighborhood and allow more telecommunications companies to compete with att and comcast
technology,not_removed,who plans on paying for this internet is not a necessity it is a luxury
technology,not_removed,so they cant go to a public library where it is free why would you want to pay more in taxes we are already trillion in debt why do people think its a good idea to keep giving out free things someone has to pay for it
technology,not_removed,congrats uhenriatis you have found the one and only thing i agree with hrc on
technology,not_removed,people are so stupid they want everything to be free someone has to pay for it they dont get the fact that you must work for things think about the great depression it was set off by credit cards buy now pay later everyone was buying but no one was paying
technology,not_removed,most of reddit were for the socialist bernie they believe everything can somehow magically be free adult life hasnt actually set in on them yet
technology,not_removed,but clinton is still in the title downvote bernie sanders
technology,not_removed,politicians are to credit a phrase bribing the public with their own money
technology,not_removed,thank you for your comment unfortunately it has been removed for the following reasons rule this submission violates the conduct guidelines in the sidebar if you have any questions please and include the link to the submission we apologize for the inconvenience
technology,not_removed,so if youre job hunting you should get free internet
technology,not_removed,i with you on that one we are paying for mbps
technology,not_removed,why would you give people who arent looking for a job free internet why would you give internet to people who could afford it
technology,not_removed,go to the fucking library and use it there
technology,not_removed,go pick your chicken tendies off the floor slob
technology,not_removed,our fucking roads and interstates are in a state of negative repair and you want goddamn free internet you are a child with childish beliefs
technology,not_removed,are you kidding me
technology,not_removed,all you scream about is more for me but youre unwilling to work for it and simply want it handed to you that is not how the universe works the rest of us dont owe you shit simply because you exist the level of entitlement and arrogance is insane youre a child screaming for more candy
technology,not_removed,dont talk to me or my wifes son ever again
technology,not_removed,did your gentle burn cause him to explode and delete his account
technology,not_removed,it wouldnt surprise me if hes invested in other areas that have or are expected to have growth associated with the the situation
technology,not_removed,ugh if he didnt sell any shares he hasnt lost anything company values go up and down all the time
technology,not_removed,well good for him im glad hes come to terms with it
technology,not_removed,a whole users surveyed about a product thats still months from being releasedreveiled
technology,not_removed,no mini jack hahahahahahahahaha
technology,not_removed,the media is so predictable media everyone loves apple and the iphone government now look here media apple are resisting our attempts to break into that shooters phone and are refusing court orders media oh no what do government start talking shit about apple keep suggesting that people are fed up of iphones and try to undo all that work you did praising apple media no one likes apple new iphone sucks even though its not out for months it literally happened over night as soon as apple said fuck you to the government all of a sudden tech sites and newspapers are shitting all over apple
technology,not_removed,the whole point is quite silly except hyped affectionados and fanboys people ought to see a product before deciding weter to buy
technology,not_removed,i would buy one but i said fuck it and got the plus last week anyway because i cant wait that long
technology,not_removed,whats the compelling feature that will make users want to upgrade losing their jack
technology,not_removed,well apple has sold over billion iphones and the sample size is
technology,not_removed,whats the compelling feature that will make users want to upgrade im not sure how anyone would know the full list of changesnewfeatures if the product isnt even announced yet the only fair way to do that would be to wait for it to be announcedprofiled and then let individual users assess which featurespriorities are important to them individually and for them to decide whether its worth upgrading to or not losing their jack joking about this is kinda like saying why would i replace my vcr with a dvd player because the discs are shiny ie evaluating the iphone by featurechange is foolish
technology,not_removed,whats the compelling feature that will make users want to upgrade im not sure how anyone would know the full list of changesnewfeatures if the product isnt even announced yet the only fair way to do that would be to wait for it to be announcedprofiled and then let individual users assess which featurespriorities are important to them individually and for them to decide whether its worth upgrading to or not losing their jack joking about this is kinda like saying why would i replace my vcr with a dvd player because the discs are shiny ie evaluating the iphone by featurechange is foolish
technology,not_removed,this move is as dumb as samsung removing the sd slot but then they fell on their sword and put it back
technology,not_removed,so we dont know the full list how about feature heres a list of what i was able to find do you see something in this list that is a compelling reason to upgrade i dont get your joke about comparing a vcr to a dvd player are you suggesting using the usb port or bluetooth is technically better than an audio jack if thats the case you would be wrong
technology,not_removed,ill happily wait till september if the iphone launches and less than of people upgrade then well see how accurate those statistics are
technology,not_removed,i dont get your joke about comparing a vcr to a dvd player are you suggesting using the usb port or bluetooth is technically better than an audio jack if thats the case you would be wrong the analog jack has a long history that goes as far back as over the past or more weve addedon and modified and adapted the analogjack as much as we possibly can were hitting the limit of what can be done with that port the digital ports microusb usbc lightning have a lot of advantages they can also do audio which means now youve got ports that can audio which is wasteful and redundant in smartphones were every tiny millimeter counts having duplicate ports is not an optimal idea they have way more pins lightning has usbc has which means you can do a lot more things compared to a analog jack data audio video poweretc can all go over cable removing the analog jack means you can make more of the datatransmission chain digital which not only gives you options for things like errorcorrection but because the data is sent digitally you can do all sorts of modificationmanipulation to it that you cant as easily do with analog example httpwwwcnetcomnewsamazonsnextnoisecancelingheadphonescouldturnoffwhensomeoneyellsyourname we probably wont know the full spectrum of things developers will come up with until this change starts happening
technology,not_removed,none of those advantages you listed is justification for removing the jack there is an old definition of intelligence that equates it with leaving as many options open for as long as possible all of those technologies you mentioned can go forward while leaving the jack in place just like purchasing an automobile today it has bluetooth it has an aux jack plus it still has a cd player edit this same digital port already exists in the iphone so removing the jack adds absolutely nothing and only takes choice away from the user
technology,not_removed,none of those advantages you listed is justification for removing the jack youre certainly entitled to have your own opinion on that apparently quite a wide variety of vendors have decided differently companies such as leeco oppo motorola and others are either already selling phones without analogjacks or are on preorder apple seems to be rumored to follow suit other companies probably will too there is an old definition of intelligence that equates it with leaving as many options open for as long as possible the problem with that especially with technologyrelated things is that endusers are stupid and lazy and will quite often choose the easiest or least secure option its a lot like microsofts problem with people continuing to use xp they literally had to stop supporting xp to force people to move on the analogjack is the same situation removing it is the only way to force the industry forward all of those technologies you mentioned can go forward while leaving the jack in place the certainly could and some smartphone manufacturers probably will continue to offer it on some models but by and large i think the big vendors will not it has bluetooth it has an aux jack plus it still has a cd player my car is old enough to have none of those things and i have friends who have newer cars that dont have cd players so no those options are not universally trueavailable to everyone
technology,not_removed,because the last eight years have been such a rainbow utopia of security and privacy right
technology,not_removed,her documented struggles with fax machines author of the article has clearly never used a fax machine before
technology,not_removed,as opposed to obama and his nsa support
technology,not_removed,is this not why they have advisors it would be like saying bernie brings foreign policy challenged record to white house
technology,not_removed,is anyone surprised that people completely ignorant on subject x are trying to legislate x excuse me while i go get my ghost gun that fires a round clip in seconds
technology,not_removed,nah hilary has her own server
technology,not_removed,theyre both over the age of what do we expect
technology,not_removed,ive noticed more and more people misusing the term luddite to mean person who is not tech savvy or person who refuses yo learn tech nah these people feared and actually physically destroyed tech nowadays you at least have to be resistant to new tech coming out to be a luddite not just bad at it also setting up your own mail server seems like something a luddite would not do wrong i just told you the definition of luddite was nothing to do with being tech savvy honestly disappointed
technology,not_removed,they are confusing technically challenged with being secure trump doesnt use email for the same reason clinton used a private server to prevent them being used against them in court emails are very useful in court cases trump wants to avoid that risk just as clinton wanted to avoid foia requests
technology,not_removed,youre kidding right trump is tweeting memeing and shit posting his way to the presidency
technology,not_removed,what a and yr old are not on the cutting edge of technology whats this world coming to when the elderly are not on top of everything technical
technology,not_removed,that is why you have the proper people in position then you trust them to tell you the right thing to do anyone think hillary had a clue in email and servers
technology,not_removed,lets put some programmer with the oval office that will go over well s
technology,not_removed,thank goodness there is a presidential technical wizard like bernie sanders i bet he wrote his own os
technology,not_removed,not that im fond of seeing government expand but is it time for a cabinet level department of technology
technology,not_removed,oh my god we get it
technology,not_removed,seriously would bernie sanders who can barely operate a comb be any better
technology,not_removed,that raises the prospect that the next occupant of the oval office — charged with making decisions on issues like encryption the fight against a socialmedia savvy islamic state and the growing automation of the american economy — will be less familiar with consumer technologies than the average citizens who use them we plebs must adapt to survive we must keep abreast of current technology or we lose our jobs and our homes our elites dont need to they wander around doing as they damn well please and if you tell them theyre required to do something they tell you to fuck off i remember george hw bush expressing amazement at grocery scanners that had been commonplace for many many years he has people to shop for him you see
technology,not_removed,this article is totally disingenuous which candidate would revoke net neutrality which candidate is antiscience and doesnt understand global warming or vaccinations tech sector leaders wrote a im not a fan of clintons lack of support for individual privacy but its not like trump is much different there especially with his tough on terrorism rhetoric this is total false equivalence
technology,not_removed,yeah and bernie definitely wouldnt mhm ok i see the agenda here hivemind
technology,not_removed,by trump has few friends in the tech industry read silicon valley investors and executives have a serious case of chapped ass cheeks over trumps threats to end their fraudulent abusive gravy train those of us who actually work in the tech industry appreciate his stance on that
technology,not_removed,give me a break one of these people has plans and staff and ability to craft a logical agenda the other has a twitter account and a doubledigit iq via hillary clinton just unveiled a farreaching plan explaining how her administration would approach technology issues promising to connect all american homes to highspeed internet by the end of the decade and revamping the countrys education system to support foreignborn engineers and us entrepreneurs the agenda released tuesday reads like a silicon valley wish list it calls for investing in computer science and engineering education expansion of technologies like mobile data and hooking up more public places such as airports and train stations with cheap abundant wifi it would continue efforts to curb abusive patent lawsuits which the tech industry says are stifling its ability to innovate and it commits to defending the governments net neutrality rules which were recently upheld by a federal appeals court and aim to ban internet providers from unfairly manipulating internet content
technology,not_removed,the worst part is the next war being waged is going to be cyber its going to be hackers breaking into our infrastructure and screwing up as much as they can if we dont have a president that understands computers how can they protect the country against hackers
technology,not_removed,isnt that also true for the majority of our government making laws about encryption government back doors and other things they dont understand fully sure some understand but i bet the majority do not
technology,not_removed,has technology replaced their jobs how are they a luddite
technology,not_removed,trumps mar a lago website looks like it was made by a year old in
technology,not_removed,trump would put people on the fcc they would end net neutrality that is something you can count on care about the net that is ground zero
technology,not_removed,another day another politico article claiming theres some kind of similarity between these radically different candidates it isnt happening guys one person knows how to work with and listen to smart people
technology,not_removed,i dont want the president to have missile launch codes written on a postit stuck to their imac
technology,not_removed,if one more hipster uses the word ludite unironically look assholes and im talking to the tech media that is suuure to read this post automation in the century is not the same as automation in the century most people will lose their jobs this time around also the unstated scope of this article seems to be excusing clintons email mishandling as mere tech illiteracy did the politico staff check with the dnc again before publishing it mustnt upset mommy and daddy you know
technology,not_removed,trump has dont confuse neat with luddite
technology,not_removed,daily reminder that tech leaders including people from slack cisco google homebrew wikipedia
technology,not_removed,perhaps thats not a bad thing obama wasnt technologically challenged he was hip to all the rad new todo and he expanded the surveillance state and erosion of americans right more than any other president i rather we vote in someones kindly old grandpappy
technology,not_removed,news flash old people bad at internet
technology,not_removed,how anyone can vote for either of the two is beyond me
technology,not_removed,and is our pm giving some reporters a lesson on quantum computing
technology,not_removed,so would they know how to do an ama
technology,not_removed,given his temper and propensity for saying offensive things its no wonder trump uses surrogates for all his internet dealings he can always say i didnt say that my staff did
technology,not_removed,techchallenged is too polite shit for brains is closer
technology,not_removed,when mccain was running he admitted hed never sent an email before
technology,not_removed,obama has done some stuff with open government and improving the white house technically the question is whether this may continue in the next presidency i imagine with clinton much of it will continue
technology,not_removed,crash and burn
technology,not_removed,well with trump as president itll be a nonissue the survivors will be too busy foraging for food and drinkable water to be worried about tech
technology,not_removed,google gary johnson
technology,not_removed,why would you need first hand knowledge of technology when you can have entire staffs of people knowledgeable and capable to take care of these things for you
technology,not_removed,percent of you guys here sound tech challenged
technology,not_removed,donald trump and hillary clinton would will each bring a techchallenged record to the white house since its pretty much assured one of them will get elected
technology,not_removed,which president havent been a tech luddite
technology,not_removed,at least hillary can send emails i have not seen any proof that donald trump knows how to use a computer including the ama on rthedonald that posted a photo of him sitting in front of a computer with his right hand up as if hes trying to make it look like hes using one
technology,not_removed,worst election ever
technology,not_removed,how does one hold a tablet like this
technology,not_removed,return we have never had a tech savvy president
technology,not_removed,and how many it folks understand macro economics or much of anything beyond their expertise also being able to tweet or play pokemon go isnt being tech literate id say most people are techchallenged including the young just because someone has an iphone and the latest apps they think theyre being all futuristic and techie
technology,not_removed,not really sure if better president is one that does prefer to use pen and paper or one that purposefully violated numerous it security standards to conceal her dealings first one can at least be educated or rely on aides the other one is going to stay crooked
technology,not_removed,the internet is a series of tubes never forget
technology,not_removed,theyre both old of course they dont know what tech is
technology,not_removed,president obamas inauguration was in january the iphone came out in june of and the droid came out in november of in the episode of bear grylls show with the president on he talks about how he doesnt know how to unlock his staffers phone to take a selfie because he cant have a smartphone due to security concerns a lot has changed in the last eight years
technology,not_removed,not using emailsocial media personally for a person in a top management position is a boost in productivity it also stops them from making fools of them selves writing stuff they didnt think trough it is a good thing
technology,not_removed,trump often relies on staff to print news articles off the internet god i can just picture him going through a stack of with celebrity tweets printed on
technology,not_removed,i wonder how many bernie supporters upvoted this
technology,not_removed,can someone i dont understand what is meant by techchallenged to me that seems like a very broad term
technology,not_removed,hillary wants to hand everything to guest workers adopting a anticitizen policy no doubt that it pleases silicon valley firms but the rest of us are harmed by the resulting fraud and abuse thats hardly a luddite policy unless one counts the creation of displaced citizens as luddite policy instead of trying to please sv why not work on getting citizens back in the workforce
technology,not_removed,completely agree clinton is totally intellectually unequipped to deal with the technological challenges that will face the next president trump is far far worse what i found the most shocking is that clinton doesnt even use a laptop and has never used a pc or a laptop in the course of her career she is nearly completely computer illiterate worse it goes without saying that she was told repeatedly by it people at every single level that her email server at her house was insecure and a major security violation she would have been told this every single time any it professional she knew would have heard about it even after being told over and over and over again she still refused to listen to expert advice trump would be worse in pretty much every single way trump or clinton us leadership in technological innovation is about to end
technology,not_removed,just so everyones aware theres actually more than two political parties rlibertarian
technology,not_removed,hillary is actually a tech nerd and gamer she was one of the first big name politicians to get a smartphone back in the it was well known that she traveled with a gameboy and always had the latest games
technology,not_removed,trump is waayyyy ahead in terms of technology you simply cannot be as dank a memer as he is without being up to date
technology,not_removed,i just want to say that i am incredibly familiar with technology and will be eligible to run next election i am not an elite im not even middle class vote for me or not im not the police im just a poor dude on reddit
technology,not_removed,bill clinton claimed to only sending emails while he was in office official emails through the white house server
technology,not_removed,yuh mean like wipe it with a cloth
technology,not_removed,trump seems to know how to use technology much better than hillary
technology,not_removed,tbf is knowing how to use snapchat and tinder really a qualification to be president i prefer a president who knows the laws and knows how to get things passed through congress over one who can debug my code
technology,not_removed,do you guys expect the president to be an expert in every single field is that even possible
technology,not_removed,i dont care its not the presidents job to dictate the mass integration of new technology i want the government to meddle less in this bullshit and let the rest of us figure it out for ourselves
technology,not_removed,yes a cissp should be a requirement to get elected
technology,not_removed,the middle meat of the article quotes experts explaining how the are not even close to similar with hillary understanding and using technology such as the private server because she wanted email on a mobile device when travelling the world as sos but trump doesnt even own a single computer or phone and has his bubble print out his emails and tells them what to tweet trump wants to go after all media that he does not like in violation of the amendment and tech companies but both sides are bad right but this poor excuse for a website still tries to play the both sides are bad game journalism is dead
technology,not_removed,hillary cant even type
technology,not_removed,im just not a believer in email trump said lets be clear here if you vote for this person you are voting for a person who doesnt believe in writing and sending messages
technology,not_removed,difference being that hillary clinton has proven herself over the years that she listens to people and trump has proven that he listens to trump
technology,not_removed,at least trump knows how to use twitter
technology,not_removed,trump has basically run his campaign on twitter facebook and instagram his personal twitter is fucking legendary thats a tech challenged president
technology,not_removed,neither have any authority to legislate anything related to technology until they can prove they can at least set up their own goddamn wifi
technology,not_removed,clinton i believe in science trump we should use couriers not wires for the military ok
technology,not_removed,theyre not ludditesever try to teach gram and gramps to use their computer effectively
technology,not_removed,theyve both got twitter mastered so yay
technology,not_removed,is that not having driven a car in ears part of hillarys being technologically challenged
technology,not_removed,tim kaine however is the most innovation friendly senator in the senate
technology,not_removed,theyre both ancient most presidents are that idiot trump is and clinton both would face mandatory retirement in almost all jobs out there and in anything highstress that requires stability theyd be instantly disqualified i dont know why presidential candidates couldnt be in the prime of their lives wisdom neither of these two candidates have a thimbleful of it though i suppose clinton is the least bad
technology,not_removed,neither canidate is computer literate but trump knows how to delegate responsibly for tech matters far better than clinton by default she and the greater dnc are a tech shit show based on all the scandals and leaks there are obviously plenty of hackers who would love to make trumprnc look bad but nothing comes out either they arent saying anything worth leaking or they protect their data well
technology,not_removed,if you think obama is tweeting and throwing up instagram photos himself youre a pretty out of touch all of his technolgy knowledge is actually teams of people working for him also the ability to throw up a photo on instagram does not map directly to the ability to understand cyber security attack vectors we have yet to have a leader in a high position that understands technology
technology,not_removed,these clowns need to be taught or removed
technology,not_removed,the only reason we even know about it is because of the illiteracy of the elite
technology,not_removed,well its been the term that all of this came to light not like it hasnt been going on for multiple terms
technology,not_removed,oh its been total garbage during the obama administration as well but hillary cant have it both ways either she is tech savvy and intentionally shit all over the foia for personal gain and as a consequence would also deserve an indictment or she knows less about technologyprivacy than my grandmother take your pick i guess we dont even need to talk about trump we will just cite his twitter account and move on
technology,not_removed,shouldve voted for john mcafee
technology,not_removed,rip michael hastings
technology,not_removed,luddite doesnt mean unaware of technology it means opposed to technological progress theres no reason to believe that clinton knows any less about technology than any of our prior ten presidents ok so carter was a nuclear sub engineer he may be the rare outlier trumps our candidate not opposed to technology just thinks hes an expert at things hes clueless about
technology,not_removed,yeah after they killed net neutrality it was obvious how much of a luddite obama is and his inability to make tech savvy appointments oh wait
technology,not_removed,you are right but when your leader brings their oppressive autocracy down on your neck you would at least wish if heshe knew what they were talking about from a non us perspective obama was a good president he knew how computers worked he used social media he highlighted the correct issues regarding tech and he worked towards better technology education do you realize how rare this is in the world
technology,not_removed,why are you so fixated on the last years the patriot act was passed in
technology,not_removed,so we should trust the person who lies about keeping top secret and higher information on a home server
technology,not_removed,i would take that as a compliment
technology,not_removed,fax machines have it coming
technology,not_removed,seriously fuck fax machines
technology,not_removed,i tried once started to figure out that i needed to connect my printer to the phone line and gave up on that useless system
technology,not_removed,it always takes me a few minutes to send a fax these days the interfaces are terrible because faxing is a lesser function jammed onto a printer or copier i can only imagine the pain of trying to use a secure fax probably has a hundred buttons
technology,not_removed,it isnt like young people have any idea how to use fax machines anyway
technology,not_removed,i like to consider myself pretty tech literate i cannot figure out fax machines for the life of me
technology,not_removed,only if he picks cereal killer for his vp
technology,not_removed,crash burn oh wait
technology,not_removed,angelheaded hipsters searching for the ancient heavenly connection to starry dynamo in the machinery in the night also anything else mom you want me to mow the lawn oops i forgot new york no grass
technology,not_removed,its looking like no matter what were going to crash and burn
technology,not_removed,yo man i thought you was black
technology,not_removed,john mcafee
technology,not_removed,hes name is crash override
technology,not_removed,ill take someone who can hack a gibson over someone with an insecure email server any day
technology,not_removed,personally id choose santa claws
technology,not_removed,this a garbage post its trash
technology,not_removed,mess with the best die like the rest
technology,not_removed,shed want to ban them probably
technology,not_removed,vice presidents network
technology,not_removed,she will be told about vpns by her corporate friends
technology,not_removed,the article is about clinton and trumps incompetence with and lack of understanding of technology more so than poor positions on tech issues i really dont like how obama handled that shit either but at least im reasonably confident he understands what the issues are more than i can say for hillary and lets not even get started with trump banning encryption and getting bill gates to help close parts of the internet
technology,not_removed,at least thats not tech challenged
technology,not_removed,hes so tech savvy
technology,not_removed,obama is aware that automation is going to remove millions of jobs imminently at least hes thinking about it hilary and donald are going to be hit in the head at full speed with reality
technology,not_removed,there is a difference between having a grasp of whats going on but referring to experts for the finer details and outright not knowing whats going on so you hire someone to tell you what to do neither of them and arguably a lot of those in congress have no idea how to manage technology policy because they barely have a grasp of what something like the internet is or how people use it at least sanders foreign policy has a vision of lets not go to war or lets reduce the military presence abroad the details can be worked out with advisors from there these guys tech policy ranges from government regulating the internet is bad to only terrorists use encryption
technology,not_removed,it would be like saying bernie brings foreign policy challenged record to white house isnt that a totally reasonable thing to say people did question his foreign policy experience relative to clintons in the primary
technology,not_removed,if their campaign staffs are an indication of what a potential presidential administrationstaff would be like competent technical staffadvisors would be wary of working for a president clinton competent technical staffadvisors would refuse to work for a president trump for people who arent into politics and know whos who of campaign staffers and consultants its hard to explain how normal clintons campaign and how weird and crazy trumps campaign is the incompetence of the plagiarism in melania trumps speech is the very public sign of how bumbing the staff is plagiarism in a draft isnt surprising but that it wasnt caught before an event this high profile is astounding i could go on suffice it to say some excellent people would shy away from a clinton white house but trump has not been able to get anyone competent to associate themselves with his campaign and its likely nearly the same would occur for his administration
technology,not_removed,no advisors are simply there to keep the president up to date and sort through relevant new material the president is supposed to actually understand the materials theyll be in charge of sadly a focus on law or business is the only way to get enough political contacts and sway to make it through primaries
technology,not_removed,bernie lacking foreign policy experience was a major criticism because thats almost all of the job of the executive you dont outsource your core competency a president who doesnt understand global politics cant just be brought up to speed by a consultant whenever circumstances force him to begrudgingly do something beyond the realm of the domestic policy he cant control technical knowledge is increasingly of such foundational importance as software has grown to encompass all areas of human endeavor there are no longer technology companies all industries are now defined by computers healthcare retail logistics food distribution financial markets the media banking the power grid all now existing as or primarily controlled by software understanding computers and the internet at a conceptual not technical level is no longer just an item for a candidates resume its as foundational as literacy itself the important legal questions of our time involve how to apply our longstanding principles like standards for search and seizure to a world in which most of our lives and assets exist as data or rows in a company database the person today nominating court justices or deciding on doj policy is laying the foundation for our future in this new world understanding of the technology and concepts at the core of our lives today is not something you can glean from a policy brief not being able to explain the difference between the internet the web and applications is as damning today as not knowing the difference between continents tectonic plates and countries
technology,not_removed,this is very correct and something a lot of people overlook a wise king knows what he knows and knows what he doesnt know i would rather the president be ignorant on important subjects and be aware of it and employ experts to advise him you cant expect the president to be allknowing
technology,not_removed,maybe if bernie was out of touch enough to speak about the recent troubles in constantinople
technology,not_removed,this is what advisors are supposed to be for however clinton ignored such advisory regarding her email serverbarely responded to silicon valleys backdoors are a bad idea by suggesting a magical manhattan project against encryption and trump has his whole they cant see the forest for the trees thing
technology,not_removed,this isnt rforeignpolicy
technology,not_removed,didnt work for her blackberry use at the state department
technology,not_removed,do the clips have bullet buttons
technology,not_removed,i thought it was caliber magazine clip half a second look up the jerry miculek spelling video on it its pretty funny
technology,not_removed,dont forget the shoulder thing that goes up
technology,not_removed,yeah shes into very open technology
technology,not_removed,yeah she regularly aptget upgrades security updates
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,i appreciate your definition of a luddite as a person or group who opposes technology bringing to mind the textile workers who destroyed machines that were threatening their livelihood during the industrial revolution however the recent encryption fiasco has shown these candidates willing to oppose fundamentally important security technology in order to serve law enforcement at the expense of just about everyones privacy opposing technology that helps people but reduces government snooping is almost behaving like a luddite wouldnt you say
technology,not_removed,the aides have emails saying clinton is unable to work a computer
technology,not_removed,he tweets like a mad man
technology,not_removed,or you know its actually him being technologically inept since he thinks encryption is evil and helps terrorists and thinks video games cause violence not that hillary is any better
technology,not_removed,if tweeting is all you need to know to be tech literate the bar got so low
technology,not_removed,it doesnt count because my feelings s
technology,not_removed,how else would we know that global warming is a chinese hoax or vaccines have a correlation to autism such deep insight
technology,not_removed,enough of a clue to ask for disabling security features so she could use the blackberry the nsa specifically told her not to use
technology,not_removed,why so much clinton criticism but everyone gives trump a pass
technology,not_removed,no and thats the entire point everyone in this thread is making she has no grasp at all on even basic technology principles and wants to create a backdoor for encryption not only is that idiotic it is also extremely dangerous to boot then again trump isnt better either
technology,not_removed,pfft lets make stallman president
technology,not_removed,im ok with this
technology,not_removed,thats what the bernouts imagine the reality is
technology,not_removed,he has stances regarding encryptionprivacy that the experts agree with it wasnt a major part of his campaign but it was his stance on these issues that made me support him
technology,not_removed,eh my grand uncle is old and uses facebook and instagram just fine and finds himself new music to listen on youtube and spotify also the best computer that i know nearby belongs to a old because he likes gaming with his son my friend and aint no one in my friend group who can armsrace that guy most of us dont got free cash to just buy a new gpu every year because hey i saw the specs had more power they may never code a thing but just because someone is old doesnt mean they cant be an outlier and do just fine and understand the basics i dont specifically think bernie is great at tech but this is mostly about the part age just gives statistical odds but there are plenty enough year olds who dont understand shit about tech except my facebook dont work wtf too
technology,not_removed,do you know otherwise really fucking stupid to think all old people are fucking idiots with computers
technology,not_removed,i remember george hw bush expressing amazement at grocery scanners that had been commonplace for many many years he has people to shop for him you see this is a common misconception as you can see httpwwwsnopescomhistoryamericanbushscannerasp he wasnt amazed at the concept of a grocery scanner he was amazed at the new technology in grocery scanners he was visiting a grocers convention and these new scanners could even read barcodes that were mangled and damaged a natural curiosity about new technology is by no means a bad thing if you look at the top post of the sub right now people are marvelling at new technology for headphones what is worse is a newspaper in this case the new york times sloppily reporting the event to an extent where he was chastised by many just for wondering about new technology
technology,not_removed,which candidate expressed wanting to create a manhattan project to take on encryption again it wasnt the oompa loompa in the race
technology,not_removed,which candidate would revoke net neutrality a disturbing number of people on reddit believe this would be clinton when you confront them with the fact that she is actually for net neutrality they just hand wave it away claiming she would change positions if elected this is despite her having spent years advocating for net neutrality including cosponsoring bills while she was in the senate its fucking baffling how difficult it has become to have an intelligent discussion about net neutrality and the politics surrounding it on reddit these days
technology,not_removed,just a reminder that hillary and her dnc extension are not really killing it when it comes to protecting themselves from even lowtech hackers im not voting for trump but i sure as hell believe he has a few smart tech people in his companies with legit experience
technology,not_removed,hooking up more public places such as airports and train stations with cheap abundant wifi welcome to now its for everybodytm
technology,not_removed,what is the federal governments definition of highspeed internet probably something that was current in
technology,not_removed,not talking about hillary if you said one has plans and a logical agenda or were you paid to post that drivel
technology,not_removed,trumps tech staff far exceeds clintons
technology,not_removed,luddit i think you are being a little too literal with the term look up the slang definition
technology,not_removed,i cant distinguish who youre talking about
technology,not_removed,theyre arguably identical besides the few pop issues that are meant to create an illusion of difference their views are almost identical politically speaking both support the current governmental structure both support fptp voting both support larger government both support continuing our collapsing fiat currency both support the federal reserve both dont support human longevity or space exploration they both are against marriage equality the similarities go on and on
technology,not_removed,in shock news today tumblr and flickr condemn donald trump
technology,not_removed,liberal tech industry fears republicans is this news those guys hate republicans no matter who they are
technology,not_removed,wikipedia googlesjw laden shitholes
technology,not_removed,obama was and is technologically illiterate
technology,not_removed,the world is no longer a place where a kindly old grandpappy is in any way ideal the world is moving forward and making technological leaps daily the next great war has started and it is being fought digitally and online we cannot afford a president who is stuck in the past or cannot understand the technological challenges the future is bringing
technology,not_removed,how anyone can vote for either of the two is beyond me the winner gets to fill scalias scotus seat that should be all you need to know
technology,not_removed,its pretty simple really anyone willing to remove themselves from a political race theyve just supported can see the obvious difference between clinton and trump one is deceptive one is not based in reality your choice
technology,not_removed,trump is why you vote for clinton
technology,not_removed,youre so edgy
technology,not_removed,they almost have graduated from all the best high schools
technology,not_removed,when one of the main requirements is that you be what chance have you got
technology,not_removed,economists got us in this mess for once perhaps we might want to not take their recommendations especially when it pertains to guest workers trade agreements
technology,not_removed,rgreenparty
technology,not_removed,and yet she wants a manhattanlike project to break encryption that statement is even scarier to me if she isnt techilliterate
technology,not_removed,hm
technology,not_removed,til full article about the gameboy with photo proof
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,hey i have one of those can i be president
technology,not_removed,journalism isnt dead its just been swimming in the tank so long its devolved into a parasitic sucker fish depending for its essential life sustenance from bottom feeding on the body politic
technology,not_removed,citing the dailymail you are a very smart media consumer
technology,not_removed,she uses a blackberry to send texts and emails so
technology,not_removed,or drive a car or apparently hold a news conference
technology,not_removed,maybe he just doesnt believe in leaving evidence lying around
technology,not_removed,hillary listens to her wall street backers and other financial interests and then just says what ever polls the best in public trump does the same thing except instead of wall street its just whatever the fuck he has been told might make money and in public he just says whatever ignorant thing pops into his fool head
technology,not_removed,according to the learned tech enthusiasts of reddit someone does all that for him because reasons
technology,not_removed,following the instructions that came in the box makes you tech savvy i bet youre running wep on yours
technology,not_removed,thats actually not the worst idea as far as military comunications go not that we should switch over entirely but we certainly should be training people in how to utilize them but im fucking hammered so pinch of salt eh
technology,not_removed,both would face mandatory retirement in almost all jobs out there youre an idiot rest of your comment didnt disprove my opinion
technology,not_removed,will we look back in years and become nostalgic for the days when politicians werent computer savvy it seems bizarre that a presidential candidate could be so out of touch with a core tenet of american society the president of would likely be right about now immersed in our technological world ill likely be old and ancient and out of touch myself by then
technology,not_removed,well its illiteracy or just abject disregard for whatever we might find along the margins
technology,not_removed,you spelled edward snowden wrong
technology,not_removed,why youre not a fax machine
technology,not_removed,acid burn for secretary of state
technology,not_removed,hack the dnc
technology,not_removed,look at uthezombiefever over here were all making movie puns trying to lighten the mood and hes talking about actual politics
technology,not_removed,whats that from i mean i know the first part is from howl but the second part whats that
technology,not_removed,not if you vote for gary johnson he only needs more support to be a legitimate threat
technology,not_removed,he legitimately ran for the libertarian ticket didnt he
technology,not_removed,i mean except the one shes using
technology,not_removed,to be fair her husband did get encryption transferred from being a munition to being regulated by the department of commerce then again he was much younger then
technology,not_removed,yeah seriously
technology,not_removed,unlike trump who would embrace them along with all our privacy rights because hes such a man of the people gimmie a break
technology,not_removed,only for those who she doesnt approve of
technology,not_removed,they already tried once
technology,not_removed,getting bill gates bill will tell him to pound sand
technology,not_removed,yeah he knows what he did shame on him
technology,not_removed,thats why you appoint the heads of the countrys largest isps to your cabinet problem solved s
technology,not_removed,i think the point is no candidate is going to be perfect with total experience
technology,not_removed,could you go on im sort of fascinated by the and level people in campaigns and what they all do i imagine they are professionals at doing this but i have no perspective and would love to hear a bit more about how it all works thanks
technology,not_removed,pay me and ill work for anyone
technology,not_removed,im not sure what youre saying why would advisors be wary
technology,not_removed,hillarys staff is currently being investigated by the state department for their actions during the email and use of blackberry situations the investigation was begun the day after the fbi investigation ended every one who worked for her could easily lose security clearance so bumbling indeed
technology,not_removed,say it louder for the people in the back
technology,not_removed,completely incorrect
technology,not_removed,yes i dont see how a person who doesnt know how computer networks work would be able to understand the modern banking system still we have those people tell us about series of tubes
technology,not_removed,the pig will stick you with that
technology,not_removed,maybe puts them in the circle but since its not fear or ignorance driving them i cant grant them full status
technology,not_removed,he has said that hes seen his friends get fucked by emails so he doesnt use them hillary leary cant handle that server oh and hillary is the one who led the charge trying to ban violent video games up is down and down is up anymore man
technology,not_removed,he specifically said its for security reasons i dont think he is technologically inept he runs a good part of his campaign through the internet and is very proficient at crafting his message for the internet audience he is dominating clinton online despite her investments in astroturf groups
technology,not_removed,trump supports video games and marijuana legalization
technology,not_removed,how is that technological ineptitude when youre the president all nonmilitary encryption is evil because it hampers your ability to be a tyrannical autocrat hes just thinking ahead
technology,not_removed,i dont think you realize shitposting is called that because its bad
technology,not_removed,yeah its not like the office of president is important or anything its all just one big joke right
technology,not_removed,trump supporters already know hes a cunt and they dont care hillary supporters seem to be in denial
technology,not_removed,do you feel the bern thats why hillary beat bernie reddit fucking hates hillary for that
technology,not_removed,because people who like trump are religious they believe with no evidence no ability and no history that he will somehow fix everything and make them all rich they believe america is a terrible disaster and they are all dying and starving trump says all the stupid lies and they buy it like he is a priest giving a sermon
technology,not_removed,i think everyone even trump supporters assume that trump doesnt know shit about technology everyone also realizes that trump supporters dont give a shit if trump knows anything about technology so all you have left to scare are people who dislike trump hence why hillary gets bashed a hillary supporter might actually be upset to know hillary is crap with technology and yet has opinion seriously everyone gives trump a pass because you kind of assume if someone likes him they believe he is magic and he will hire smart people in some magical and awesome way that is different from all the other presidents who hire smart people or they just like trumps fuck you attitude and dont care what he knows or doesnt know so what is the point of pointing out that he is so incompetent with technology he would struggle to navigate a modern windows computer does anyone care nope
technology,not_removed,no politician has that training and understanding you are suggesting an it guy qualifies for office but an educated and experienced politician does not
technology,not_removed,for some reason i think that rms will turn the us into a socialist country with no borders a great country where people are not denied the means to seek a living by companies or denied entry and the chance to live and work there
technology,not_removed,people just want to hate hillary so much they make up reasons to do so when you point out she actually has a reasonable social program people just flat out deny it because they dont want to hear it or think shes corrupt
technology,not_removed,technology policy is about understanding complex tradeoffs in the crafting of rules and regulations while weighing best interests not consulting the it guy the relevant vector is ability to listen understand complex issues and enact legislation as of now one person has a logical plan that silicon valley generally approves of and the other has angry tweets the whole premise of the article is kind of a red herring
technology,not_removed,i would be interested to see if the the tech staff for his organization is an exception on the political side the competent professionals have stayed away like its the plague trumps campaign has zero proven high level political advisors or staffers they are staying far far away its amateur hour as we saw with the plagiarized sections of melanias speech going to air
technology,not_removed,comes to protecting themselves from even lowtech hackers the gru and fsb are low tech granted theyre not doing fantastic but i doubt rnc security is much better they just arent being targeted or being found
technology,not_removed,just a reminder that hillary and her dnc extension are not really killing it when it comes to protecting themselves from even lowtech hackers im not voting for trump but i sure as hell believe he has a few smart tech people in his companies with legit experience im not saying that state level hackers were needed to break into the dnc but pay attention this wasnt amateur hour which should be obvious by the way the entire release has occurred the way that an information clearinghouse was necessary by the timing and by the appropriate rampup to the release trump is a tool
technology,not_removed,fact is the government has some of the best techies in the world but government computer are the targets of hackers around the globe russia wiki china and many others are trying to penetrate us governmental systems trump is a lost soul in tech
technology,not_removed,if you dont think she has the capability of producing plans and agendas you are living in a fantasy world even those who hate her ideology think she is a neocon war hawk and so on can have the sense to admit she has enacted legislation and pushed agendas as for the logical agenda part that was written out you can criticize feasibility of enactment but the positions and ideas themselves are either sensible or they are not
technology,not_removed,an assertion based on what available evidence
technology,not_removed,the choice in this election is clear vote for one of the candidates
technology,not_removed,hint only one believes that climate change is manmade and that vaccines dont cause autism
technology,not_removed,trump and clinton arent as close as you propose perhaps you shouldnt suggest otherwise without knowing the facts
technology,not_removed,this is the really shitty thing you cant vote for the good candidates due to the fear that the awful one will win and fill the scotus seat
technology,not_removed,yup thats how she gets my vote the republicans would have had am easy victory if someone sane was going against her
technology,not_removed,she doesnt care about security or data classifications even though she is required as is anyone who holds a clearance from public trust through tssci i believe she has yankee white based on her being former sos to go through training yearly on this very concept and droves of people will discount this reality and vote for her because trump is a bully
technology,not_removed,are you saying a programmer of some horseshit ios or android app is the best person to lead the country some crm admin database admin which discipline within it has the best chance at leading the country and being tech savvy dare i say a project manager cmon youre sounding utterly ridiculous at this point
technology,not_removed,it only cares about making a profit because companies used to let their journalists run around doing real reporting without regards for profit now everything is about clickbait or reporting an agenda
technology,not_removed,gonna need a senzu bean for that one
technology,not_removed,you can go back and watch videos of trump saying these same things years ago which is it trump says what he wants and doesnt care what people think or he just says what people tell him to make money whatever you think of trump i think most people understand that this point that trump does trump hes had too much fuck your money for too long to give a damn what others think when he believes in his gut that hes right
technology,not_removed,and you listen to trump and faux news
technology,not_removed,some of the people on good politics and law courses arent exactly technically gifted actually they are shockingly similar to old people in the future they might not know much beyond how to operate a phone use social media and other basic things
technology,not_removed,unfortunately most year olds ive met seem to be satisfied that the technology works and arent interested beyond that this leads to shit like passwords sensitive data being sent over unencrypted channels
technology,not_removed,the president of would likely be right about now immersed in our technological world yeah but they wont know shit about neural nets and deep learning or whatever is around that time keep in mind the average redactor is probably slightly more advanced technologically than the overall average of people their age people in law school are not often programmers my father could use a vhs camcorder and hook it up to the tv for my grandmother to watch because she didnt understand technology i regularly have to answer questions about computers for my father because he doesnt understand the technology i can program in c and python make sql queries and wire up circuits to as raspberry pi but sometimes the students i work with need to explain to me the intricacies of snapchat because i dont understand an year old now is not going to be just as out of touch in as a a year old is today
technology,not_removed,i think youre overstating the computer and technological literacy of the average american most kids and teens dont know much about computers beyond how to facebook google and clear internet history
technology,not_removed,wait im right now and im immersed in tech can i be president in
technology,not_removed,politicians in the future will be just as out of touch with the new technology of the future as politicians today are with the technology of today consider this one day probably not far from today a generation will grow up with computers to aid them with every single little fucking decision they can possibly make and on that day people as young as will probably find it ridiculous that teenagers go to the computer in their fridge and ask it what they feel like eating
technology,not_removed,you call knowing how to charge a phone and how to snap a penis picture immersed in our technological world i doubt even know what an ip address is
technology,not_removed,i dunno seems to me most young people know pretty little about tech other than how to use the interface on their apple or android products in other words nothing on the behind the scenes in their devices
technology,not_removed,i mean theyre both older than the old folk i know can barely work a smart phone theyre both rich enough that if they need something done they can just hire people to do it and never bother with learning it themselves am i disappointed theyre not technologically literate yes of course am i surprised about it no absolutely not
technology,not_removed,oh no that just couldnt be right i distinctly remember during his campaign he said that he would have a transparent and open presidency
technology,not_removed,your two links are identical
technology,not_removed,thats not super fair the article lists a huge number of requests about the nsa wiretapping which came to the publics eye and ire only recently and is obviously secret of course theyre not going to release info on that plus the article says the requests took a huge upswing so of course more are going to get denied a better comparison would have been percentages rather than absolutes
technology,not_removed,what was the nature of the foia requests that were denied
technology,not_removed,vote for the best die like the rest
technology,not_removed,lord nikon for fcc chairman
technology,not_removed,the second part is from hackers
technology,not_removed,both are quotes from the movie hackers a reply to the zero cool comment which is a characters screen name in that movie
technology,not_removed,and he also doesnt support net neutrality is not in favor of any firearm regulation legislation and is in favor of privatized forprofit prisons to be fair these are traditional libertarian stances but it doesnt make them right look theres a good chance im going to vote for him out of principle since i dont live in a swing state ri he certainly is going to be the first party candidate to make a real dent in a presidential election but hes not the answer hell my dad a lifelong republican that worships reagan and voted for bush in and is going to vote for johnson this year but hes most definitely not representative of his peers
technology,not_removed,is still running afaik libertarian party actually nominated gary johnson though
technology,not_removed,she wont even know what a vpn is
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,give you a break from what both of them are probably terrible for tech especially anything related to privacy or security
technology,not_removed,trump would probably deport anyone who uses them
technology,not_removed,bill gates would make a nice president too bad hes smart enough to avoid the clusterfuck of the american electoral system
technology,not_removed,id love bill as a billionaire to weigh in he could hold a press conference to tell donald to eat dicks then hire enough lawyers to preemptively sue him for the next years
technology,not_removed,pretty sure he can read internet articles he just prefers to read on paper which is understandable there are people who still prefer a book over ereader and highlight stuff that interests him and lets face it highlighting stuff on the screen still needs to be worked out to be as intuitive as using pen and paper an eink display with touch capabilities is not really a common thing as far as i am aware
technology,not_removed,he said in a series of interviews that he does not need to read extensively because he reaches the right decisions with very little knowledge other than the knowledge i had plus the words common sense because i have a lot of common sense and i have a lot of business ability trump said he is skeptical of experts because they cant see the forest for the trees he believes that when he makes decisions people see that he instinctively knows the right thing to do a lot of people said man he was more accurate than guys who have studied it all the time
technology,not_removed,hillary might listen trump definitely doesnt care much for advice
technology,not_removed,remember when all of this stupid ass website was bitching about tom wheeler and that ended up being completely incorrect
technology,not_removed,the point is the top candidates have proven to have a limited and arguably harmful understanding of technology both have proven positions and political ties that suggest a huge step backwards in technological development
technology,not_removed,you wouldnt work for someone whod ruin your prospects of getting any other job in the future though
technology,not_removed,its government they dont pay you piss
technology,not_removed,there is more than one race this election season senators and governors need campaign staffers they might sit this round out but they are scouting the fresh crop i believe axelrod had connections of grooming obama all the way back in businesses need public outreach and publicity coordinators politicos skills easily translate to the private sector if you have experience with a well known figure it is also a good reference i have a friend who has worked in a few campaigns and in the offices of elected officials he has quite a few options each election cycle he is currently settled into a lucrative private sector position based on his political hack experience
technology,not_removed,security classification is by executive order if clinton is prez her former staff are not going to lose their security clearances the fbi can investigate all they want
technology,not_removed,ctra ctrc ctrv ctra ctrb enter
technology,not_removed,hillary leary not sure what that was supposed to be but now i have a vision of hillary synthesizing lsd
technology,not_removed,he has said that hes seen his friends get fucked by emails so he doesnt use them have you seen his twitter account because lol if you have seen his twitter account and believe this
technology,not_removed,but it is the kind of bad that is good and enjoyable
technology,not_removed,shitposting isnt bad shitposting is what we need i would love for donald trump to start shitposting on reve
technology,not_removed,shitposting means it is loweffort and usually full of injokes but not necessarily bad it can be enjoyable despite that just look how popular rmeirl is
technology,not_removed,my grandfather and mother are aware enough that when i tell them to not do something theyll actually not do it hillary apparently ran ramshod over the experts that were telling her it was a bad idea if they werent those are the people who should be indicted
technology,not_removed,older people may not know what an ip address is or how chrome extensions work but come on this is on par with running over a group of girl scouts and claiming your too old to know what a parking brake is she sure as fuck knew enough about what it was to ask people to circumvent and then try and cover her ass when it became public knowledge
technology,not_removed,encryption has existed for centuries think cesar cyphers or even the enigma machine in wwii surely the aide could have made the comparison to the enigma machine
technology,not_removed,ive hated hillary long before bernie even announced his run shes a godawful candidate and a terrible person still better than trump though
technology,not_removed,you could say the same for all of the people who voted for obama in or hillary this year because of the minoritygender appeal that once there is someone besides an old white man as president that their problems and the issues in the world are just gonna go poof people are incredibly short sighted
technology,not_removed,think shes corrupt its utterly baffling how anyone with two functioning brain cells and corresponding synapses enabling them to work in unison could arrive at a different conclusion
technology,not_removed,to craft policy you have to at least have a credible understanding of the real world practice you cant just listen to the richest ceos and enact their interests we all know hilldawg doesnt know technology and her policy will just be ideas from the highest bidders not really the interests of the masses weve already seen the contempt and neglect displayed pointing to a nicely worded policy statement just proves the carpet doesnt match the drapes
technology,not_removed,a link to an obscure site called hotair that itself references another obscure site called threatconnect for evidence yeahhh no
technology,not_removed,for hrc email it was being accessed via consumer telcos in foreign nations is it really that hard to log all the traffic tofrom a single device anyone with access to any of the routers along the way would be more than half way home
technology,not_removed,on the fact that russia isnt hacking trumps servers daily
technology,not_removed,the choice in this election is clear vote for nobody
technology,not_removed,whoever you vote for gov wins
technology,not_removed,is that the one who doesnt understand the second amendment
technology,not_removed,trump hates the federal reserve and has joined rand paul in calling for a complete audit of it is he if so thatd make the only valid position he has somehow that strikes me as wrong hes been consistently incorrect in his positions on everything from science to equality also he is for gay marriage and against those stupid religious freedom laws no hes not he actually wants to repeal marriage equality and make it a states issue read conservative outcome hes also spoken in support of north carolinas religious freedom law that includes bigoted antiscience antifreedom rhetoric in this aspect hes identical to hillary trump and clinton arent as close as you propose on all major issues they are on the minor crap thats mostly irrelevant and should already be settled they may speak differently but then act similarly
technology,not_removed,you cant vote for the good candidates due to the fear that the awful one will win and fill the scotus seat huh both sanders and clinton are likely to beat trump either would have been a fine choice for the democrats i dont see why you would feel that you could vote for one of the other if you intend to vote democrat on the other hand if you vote green or libertarian you really do get screwed this election year
technology,not_removed,rather than choose the lesser of two evils why not choose the sane option if you vote for a corrupt piece of shit you yourself help to enable the corrupt piece of shit things she will do you dont want that on your conscience do you of course not feelthejohnson
technology,not_removed,i voted for bernie sanders for fucks sake but you are a fool if you think big banks give very powerful and politically connected people money and dont expect something in return
technology,not_removed,and youre just here to correct the record i suppose
technology,not_removed,do yourself a favor and watch clinton cash and hillarys america you can thank me later
technology,not_removed,yep the ability to use the most basic functions of a computer is common but it is a world of difference between that and knowing advanced computer stuff even easy stuff like how to fix basic things it might not seem like a lot but it really is these are the people who are usually your boss or his boss that have yahoo bars on their browser with buttons on each its not even that they dont know but dont want to learn the types that think learning ending at school im not bitter no not at all
technology,not_removed,raspberry pie no thank you i dont like sweets
technology,not_removed,i dont think its an issue of politicians not knowing tech id imagine its more of an issue of politicians not having tech savvy people among them that they trust and take advice from
technology,not_removed,also most people like to think that since theyve used a phone with internet and apps since they were teens or younger that they know how to manage technology in general no phone oses and ui are a completely different beast and dont operate on the same level doing common troublshooting on a pc often leads you into a completely different side of technology you would never be exposed to otherwise and i think that people who believe todays generation are gonna be so much better equipped to deal with technological progress in the future will find themselves just as limited stubborn and dumbfounded by technology as older people are today they dont understand the underlying foundation with how the internet works or how operating systems work outside of their phone tablet or even laptop computer they might use just to browse the internet and ms office
technology,not_removed,i agree on the usual shit passwords and even occasional things like credit card info being sent over texts but some of my friends seem interested in understanding technology
technology,not_removed,in your defense snapchat has the worst user interface since qwop and i think folks here are missing a very important difference everyone running for president this time around is a baby boomer they were from the generation that saw technological progress in hard terms faster and bigger planes going to the moon electronics from tubes to transistors televisions in every home all of that is still very tangible software and network communications are not so tangible ironically they have a far greater affect on peoples individual lives id be willing to bet that someone born in had a far easier time explaining technology to someone born in that i would have explaining the internet to a baby boomer who doesnt see the point i base this on the fact that my parents were born in the never had a problem understanding television or computers my father worked on some of the earliest computers deployed in the military and was one of the first local businessmen to computerize his accounting that was no problem as it was a pretty direct analog to typing mailing and manual bookkeeping but the internet is damned near voodoo magic to anyone who never saw a computer as anything except an analog for the old hardware used to run a business pens and paper typewriters telephones etc the good thing is that this is the end of the boomers so people on the other side of the divide are old enough to start getting elected were not talking about a need to know whatever the latest trendy app i seriously doubt the president or a senator needs to have an opinion on whether snapchat is ruined if you can send saved content what they need to understand is the implications of a deeply interconnected world so they dont end up writing tonedeaf legislation to protect ancient broken business models while sacrificing our privacy this is what things like the communications decency act dmca and sopa come from a fundamental misunderstanding of the postinternet paradigms the entire world operates under what we need in lawmakers and judges is not trendy technical knowledge but the foundational knowledge of the differences between digital files and their analog equivalents how an internet file is not the same as a book and a photocopier or a record player and a tape deck as the boomers finally fucking die youll see generations who grew up understanding software not just hardware gen x is in its right now and we built the internet anyone and under has been connected their entire adult life the people on that side of the internet divide may not know how to operate snapchats fucked up interface but they will understand the fundamentals of the digital world even when they grow older
technology,not_removed,i know a young guy at my company that is very smart computer savvy about all the little things like keyboard commands and can do texting and social brilliantly but its clear that he doesnt understand computers and how they work and communicate at all hes just been handed devices that work pretty well all his life
technology,not_removed,unless they make the effort to keep up the relationship is not as linear as you make it seem
technology,not_removed,no go to law school and ignore technology and maybe you have a chance
technology,not_removed,it would help to get leaders elected that arent in their all that means is theyve had time to make important friends
technology,not_removed,but it looks better if you have two links
technology,not_removed,it is almost as if people think holding the office is a simple matter and there arent an immense number of nuances and intricacies that make past promises and proposals down right impossible
technology,not_removed,obama cancelled a public ceremony to receive an award for transparency and instead got the award in secret
technology,not_removed,well it looks like im on top
technology,not_removed,one can only hope
technology,not_removed,in which the first part is also quoted
technology,not_removed,just some clarification of his stances he is not for or against net neutrality he is against government regulation of private industry which is to say hes in favor of letting the market sort it out hes not anti net neutrality hes anti government interference in private business he is for private prisons he believes that both private and public prisons aim to get more prisoners to increase cash flow and so this doesnt change anything however private prisons will do this at a cheaper rate his plan is to attack the root of the problem instead ie the large number of prisoners in this country which is due to victimless crimes yes he is for guns rights but thats not surprising because libertarians are firm supporters of the constitution but you already know that i agree with you in that i am not a full supporter of gary in everything he believes in in fact there is no politician who i agree with why would there be i am a different person from them however i do believe gary johnson has the best interests of the country in mind and he is also an honest hardworking politician next to clinton and trump there is no question of who is better for the job yes it is difficult but i rather make some small few compromises to benefit more on things like no meddling in wars that are not ours no more war on drugs less prisoners more freedom to do what you want to yourself etc
technology,not_removed,no worries you can run a vpn without encryption this way you can access a network without pesky private keys
technology,not_removed,were going to build a firewall and the hackers are going to pay for it
technology,not_removed,pretty sure he wants to deport people who are in the us illegally and i have trouble understanding whats so terrible about that
technology,not_removed,you dont remember bill
technology,not_removed,i love the man my role model
technology,not_removed,jesus christ people actually vote for this asshole
technology,not_removed,i feel sick i want the election over this sucks
technology,not_removed,i was elected to lead not to read my god the simpsons did it again
technology,not_removed,hillary might listen you mean the woman who had her servers hacked and demanded unsecured access to classified intel i dont fucking think so
technology,not_removed,agreed on trump but clinton deliberately ignored all advice regarding setting up her email server i am not confident in her ability to listen
technology,not_removed,to be fair there was reason to worry
technology,not_removed,no one was more surprised than the cable companies they thought they had a bought man what they really had was a guy who was taking a pay check to do their work but once freed actually was just going to do his new job the lesson from this isnt hire industry insider to regulate themselves
technology,not_removed,i dont think they have proven that they have definitely proven that they disagree with many people on reddit though p
technology,not_removed,meh that doesnt really apply to it like it does some other fields there may be a few hiring managers who might hold a grudge if you worked for a republican but by and large if you have a good personality and the skills theyre looking for they dont care who you worked for
technology,not_removed,obama was elected to the il state senate in its hard to explain how much he stood out when surrounded by the typical folks in springfield he was on a lot of peoples radar well before
technology,not_removed,its not the fbi its the state department and you are incorrect
technology,not_removed,a mix of hillary and tom lehrer likable and political
technology,not_removed,i noticed that too cant say how it happened but i want some of what shes on
technology,not_removed,weird image but funny though iirc leary wasnt known for synthesis just mass consumption
technology,not_removed,on top of refusing to attend the meetings where she would be informed on such matters
technology,not_removed,its utterly baffling how anyone with two functioning brain cells and corresponding synapses enabling them to work in unison could arrive at a different conclusion can you provide any evidence of corruption on her part i find the clintons really interesting because talk radio pundits have been calling them corrupt for over two decades now there has never been any actual evidence of corruption but the accusation has been repeated so many times that many people just think its true this has lead to all kinds of wackiness like the tons and tons of conspiracy theories that also surround them being accepted by people that would normally applies some form of critical thinking to the claims being made
technology,not_removed,your statement is nonfalsifiable rhetoric if the gap between a credible policy with logical goals and no policy at all is not enough then nothing will be enough
technology,not_removed,i like to think clinton would be smart enough to have advisers who are educated on these issues and know how to separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of policy proposals and ideas same reason a ceo has a cio who even then has a legion of directors and managers to weigh in on things
technology,not_removed,hot air is actually a pretty well trafficked conservative web blog
technology,not_removed,i have doubts that the details of the actual attack made it to the public everything about the timing of the release was to make the dnc look bad so i would take everything with a grain of salt whats your source on this anyway
technology,not_removed,thats because they would prefer him lol
technology,not_removed,thanks putin thats how we got the congress we have now
technology,not_removed,im not here to take away your guns hillary clinton during her convention speech many such cases donald j trump this isnt even close if you cant see that i worry about you
technology,not_removed,on the other hand if you vote green or libertarian you really do get screwed this election year as i said you cant vote for the good candidates without getting screwed
technology,not_removed,it would be great if people voted party but out voting system is literally designed to discourage that
technology,not_removed,if they handed a stack of cash to me id take it and i wouldnt care if they expected anything in return
technology,not_removed,trump is a record
technology,not_removed,thats true and thats much as i hate to admit it okay in the realm of politicians though they need to be able to understand that they dont know what the fuck theyre doing and that they should really really listen to the experts in the field or when dealing with secure government systems follow the rules and not try to go outside the system without very good cause trump hasnt had the chance to fuck up in this regard but i fully expect he will hillary fucked up massively with the email server thing doesnt take a rocket scientist to understand that you segment personal and professional emails and if the organization employing you runs an email server you use it and only it for your workrelated items
technology,not_removed,i knew somebody that even from a young age refused to learn things if they didnt have to like they went out of their way and ended up making their own life more difficult because they wouldnt dedicate a few minutes of time to learning a new concept two real examples from them how to read an analog clock they preferred digital how to plug in a vcr or console by matching the yellow red and white plugs into the corresponding colored ports in the back of the tv actually now that i think about it this case makes an argument for one aspect of nature vs nurture they were so young and clearly nobody ever went out of their way to teach them to refuse to learn things thats something they came up with all on their own
technology,not_removed,this people equate youngerpeople as being technology savvy for using smartphones the cloud and social media because those are new tech to the older generation however those things are no different for this generation than using a telephone a vcr and a tv years ago its just something everyone does if you want to see techsavvy for this generation theyre the ones installing or building their own roms for phones setting up services to automate tasks and hacking away at rpisarduinos i guarantee that set of criteria encapsulates far fewer young people than just using a smartphone and social media
technology,not_removed,my mom used to teach undergrad tech in education classes at a very normal university not especially smart or dumb students every year shed be shocked that students were so terrible at using very basic software like excel she was absolutely certain that it has gotten worse over the years
technology,not_removed,could that be you have tech interested friends because thats what you go for
technology,not_removed,hes just been handed devices that work pretty well all his life shit youve finally explained to me why i know how much i know about computers it wasnt that i had shit hardware or anything just that when i fucked something up i was the one that had to figure out how to fix it no running to someone with an endless purse to just buy a new one no handing off the problem to someone else then coming back to a fixed computer
technology,not_removed,keyboard commands hes already above of the public on that one guis exist and are the dominant interface for a damn good reaaon you dont have to remember what to do next a good ui takes as much memory out of the user and puts it into the system as long as they have a basic idea of their end goal the ui is there to guide them to it it doesnt mean its the fast way because keyboard shortcuts will get you places much faster but its the most user friendly way most peoples knowledge of shortcuts extends to ctrlaltdel and thats it im continuously amazed at how many people dont even know what ctrl zxcv do arguably the most universal shortcuts
technology,not_removed,or just run some failed businesses and get on tv
technology,not_removed,then fuck that im going to focus on tech
technology,not_removed,nobody said holding office is a simple matter but if you dont deliver on your promises then you missold the public a fraudulent campaign
technology,not_removed,jesus i gotta save all your asses i help we can win by votes man
technology,not_removed,letting the free market sort it out is effectively a stance against net neutrality no major provider wants it because it means they cant capitalize on contracts for prioritized peering and traffic and wont be able to favor their own media services yes solving the root of our prison problem is a good thing that said the very idea that a company can profit on prisoners is flawed these are real living people and privatization of prisons turns them into dollar signs its encouraged corruption among judges and prosecutors for sending criminals to private prisons even juveniles a case close to home was that of a luzerne county pa judge sending children with no records and minor offenses to a private juvenile facility for kickbacks the rehabilitation of people should not be left in the hands of those wishing to make money off of it
technology,not_removed,because if an illegal immigrant has a child in the us the child would be a citizen having been born here once the deportations start they would be separated from their parents i wouldnt wish for my worst enemy to have their family split apart a compromise could be made that parents of citizens wouldnt be deported but one of trumps few consistent positions throughout the campaign has been deporting every single one
technology,not_removed,careful comrade you are dangerously close to angering the hive reddit is tolerant of many things but dissent is not one of them
technology,not_removed,he wants to deport all muslims citizen or not perhaps you would have less trouble understanding how terrible that is
technology,not_removed,the devil buying himself a spot in heaven
technology,not_removed,yes we do but we also know the last years of bill and we all know that he was better than trump at everything trump claims to be good at
technology,not_removed,my father worked with him in the not in a super close capacity but he was at plenty of meetings with the man both him and balmer seemed to get off on belittling people below them and in general were huge assholes gates isnt some great man hes pulling a carnegie he doesnt want to be remembered as a ruthless business man who shat on his workers strong armed competition and was at the center of an antitrust investigation people seem to forget that there was once a legit reason to break up microsoft for being a monopoly now hes the guy trying to stop malaria hes not an evil man hes just not great either hes been shit to the state of washington pushing for shitty tax law changes and been shit to the local economy by pushing out us workers from his company during his tenure to only be replaced with low quality workers that last part is really why microsoft hasnt made anything beyond a passable product in the last years around they decided to start getting rid of all their high payed industry veterans i heard more than a handful of stories over the years of people let off from the company to be replaced with like people from india ive even heard a few horror stories about how a lot of these people they hire end up living like per apartment so they can send as much money as possible back home
technology,not_removed,id take an apologetic hitler over these two asshats
technology,not_removed,there are a lot of people that share his thought that you cant trust experts and youre being lied to by higherups and common sense is a thing that carries more weight even if your version of it is just whatever i think to be true
technology,not_removed,honestly most assholes are better than trump my asshole for instance does a pretty good job of holding in my shit as required trump spews shit whenever and wherever its least appropriate
technology,not_removed,that is why we are doomed for at least four years
technology,not_removed,neither am i but im somewhat more optimistic about her ability to listen than trumps
technology,not_removed,it went way beyond worrying
technology,not_removed,hire that last sentence is throwing me off
technology,not_removed,internal probe to reform state department policy is not an investigation like youre saying
technology,not_removed,so you honestly think that wall street firms paid her tens of millions of dollars just to hear her speak are her words magical
technology,not_removed,see nobody even knows what it is the other guy said it was a liberal website now youre telling me its a conservative one
technology,not_removed,source for what james comeys congressional testimony said she used multiple devices over unsecured networks in hostile nations despite her saying otherwise
technology,not_removed,actually we got the congress we have now because we elected a congress of mostly millionaires thinking theyd look out for the interests of us little people we got the congress we have now because and those companies spin the living hell out of everything literally everything is polarized now either you follow the party line completely or your a racist socialist somethingelseawfulist person who is completely against all good its crap ive voted in every election primary and secondary since i turned in im still going to vote now maybe not going to choose a president because there isnt a candidate i agree with at the moment but ill vote in the secondaries for sure
technology,not_removed,could have happened with perot might have shored up third party support for a few generations but alas youll likely never see johnson get perots of the vote not even close
technology,not_removed,it is difficult to get a party in the race for sure however its not the voting system that discourages that its the media that does fear and manipulation is what this election is all about
technology,not_removed,and when you dont deliver the next bag of cash goes to your opponent and when you need cash again you are sol
technology,not_removed,the issue is when the experts in the field are experts paid by lobbied interests that arent looking out for the good of the people so we need a board of experts that dont take bribes good luck with that
technology,not_removed,she didnt fuck up she wanted to avoid foia and in that regard she did fuck up i think she didnt set the thing up for convenience at all she knew it was illegal she wanted to avoid foia requests simple as that
technology,not_removed,i try to believe that trump got where he is by listening to his advisors hillary comes off as a fucking know it all
technology,not_removed,most people over a certain age are absolutely certain that it has gotten worse over the years
technology,not_removed,maybe but my highschool wasnt that big so i mostly hung out with the stonertypes
technology,not_removed,it wasnt that i had shit hardware or anything just that when i fucked something up i was the one that had to figure out how to fix it thats how i learned too when you fuck up the computer and no one is there to help you youll damn well figure out how to get it up and running and wont make the same goof again its a slow painful process with many days of spending frustrating hours googling and trying to figure out how to fix your mistakes its really just like any other growing experience
technology,not_removed,i dislike obama get that out of the way right now but i guarantee that once a future president gets elected he ends up in a briefing room with all of the simple things laid out in front of him and sees how many impossible decisions have to be made obama continued wars he promised to stop left guantanamo open has a hit list for drone strikes including extrajudicial killings of american citizens and yes journalists have complained that he has the least open administration they can remember but im also certain that this man again a man of whom i am no particular fan had more than one oh shit moment just like every other president and had to make some very hard decisions about these things he saw parts of the world being more fucked up than he knew terrorism being more active than he expected and information flowing faster than he imagined it ever could and got very worried it was out of control he saw how his hands were tied in many ways and did what he thought he had to so yeah shit didnt work out like he promised it would but it was bound to happen even with the best of intentions
technology,not_removed,letting the free market sort it out is effectively a stance against net neutrality i completely agree this is something i disagree with as well but i just wanted to clarify that there is still a difference and if free market can create something similar as a solution it is not like gary would still be against it again i am fully with you and do think net neutrality is a great thing that said the very idea that a company can profit on prisoners is flawed yes but that is the reality even right now the rehabilitation of people should not be left in the hands of those wishing to make money off of it i feel the exact same about health care too however whats the solution we really need to move into a socialist form of government where the priority is the betterment of the community rather than making money however we have to wait until that happens
technology,not_removed,he also wants to end that practice of birthright citizenship i think canada and the usa are the only forst world countries that just hand out citizenship to anyone born on their soil hell a baby was born on a flight from europe to usa once and given canadian citizenship because it was born in our airspace and thats just ridiculous
technology,not_removed,an illegal immigrants child should not be a considered a citizen
technology,not_removed,i assume that the parents would be allowed to take their children with them but if they dont then the child would be a ward of the state so if the family is split up then i think that makes it the fault of the parents for giving up their children its like any other crime if i robbed a bank with my wife and we went to prison then my child would be alone and thats sort of my fault the difference being that in this case im only going to mexico and i still have an option to bring my child with me who can go back to the states when they are if they want to btw
technology,not_removed,so all they have to do is cross the border illegally and have a child and you think that justifies citizenship for that child genuine question
technology,not_removed,just like carnegie and nobel
technology,not_removed,nothing wrong with win win now
technology,not_removed,okay fucking honestly he was a ruthless business man cry about it hes now saving millions of lives the two dont even fucking compare
technology,not_removed,i think the real takeaway here is that maybe we shouldnt consider people who are or have been complete and utter assholes for high offices unfortunately that would instantly knock out both nominees this time around and force a redo ofwait yeah can we make this a thing right now
technology,not_removed,last years oh i dunno do windows xp surface etc count
technology,not_removed,lol this is such garbage bill gates didnt have a tolerance for bullshit which is why he was a dick to his employees literally every single successful leader has the same trait
technology,not_removed,doesnt want to be remembered lol who cares he was a ruthless business man oh no mommy the man is being mean hes literally saving millions of lives now the two dont even fucking compare hes a fucking saint
technology,not_removed,they havent made anything good in the past years as far as i know the past years they have been making a come back and have been doing things right
technology,not_removed,i dont even buy that a good business man would make a good president theyd be too motivated to throw bones to whatever industry they hail from
technology,not_removed,a syphallis ridden meth addict
technology,not_removed,i hate this country
technology,not_removed,the operative phrase being pretty good
technology,not_removed,take it up with the washington post and new york times
technology,not_removed,so you honestly think that wall street firms paid her tens of millions of dollars just to hear her speak are her words magical so this is your evidence of corruption
technology,not_removed,it is one of the top websites in the world stop digging
technology,not_removed,oh i missed that you were changing the topic anyway im just going to move on
technology,not_removed,everyone needs to vote in every election every single one no one can stay home and think our democracy will just hum along by itself every single voter in every single election
technology,not_removed,im not an american but i see what you mean this messed up system has been rigged for decades – its produced the most powerful most dynamic most diverse country in the world projecting all kinds of cultural and social influence and half the world depends on its protection broadcast media is a declining empire polarisation has always existed and wealthy people have always attained power none of these things are symptomatic of a new disaster – were just more aware of them nowadays
technology,not_removed,if it had happened with perot the system would have killed off one party and stabilized with two parties again two parties is the natural conclusion of our voting system its inevitable
technology,not_removed,in a first past the post system there are only supposed to be parties
technology,not_removed,no past the post systems will always reduce to a party system its not just the media
technology,not_removed,and yet according to the press its no big deal that seems like a pretty big deal
technology,not_removed,the idiots guide to linux also known as wipe windows when youre and learn how to use linux instead
technology,not_removed,never the less when you make the public promises on the campaign trail you have to deliver on them even when policy advisers advise against it if you cant or wont or even just may not be able to deliver on promises for whatever reason dont make them if political office were a market product you could sue for gross false advertising and im not just limiting this criticism to obama though he does stand out as someone who threw out promises like confetti
technology,not_removed,i could be incorrect but it sounds like you and i share a lot of opinions i feel the same way about healthcare as well are you like me a disenfranchised bernie supporter
technology,not_removed,too bad for him it would take a constitutional amendment or a complete overturning of how the citizenship clause has been interpreted since its inception to accomplish
technology,not_removed,why the hell was someone flying that late into pregnancy
technology,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikijussoli is pretty common around the world but typically needs one parent to be a legal alien ie green card or equivalent a citizen or the child to have no citizenship of any other nationstate through blood or other reasons
technology,not_removed,i mean if you dont trust me maybe youll trust the first line of the httpswwwlawcornelleduconstitutionamendmentxiv
technology,not_removed,everyone seems to forget john d rockefeller richest man of all history with an adjusted for inflation net worth of about billion billion of which a good was earned with business tactics and practices far beyond the capabilities of bill gates i mean even carnegie is the fucking pope next to him i guess he too bought his place in heaven
technology,not_removed,im not going to get into it again but he flat out destroyed peoples lives and threw them into poverty and pulled off multiple scams that were only legal because no one had thought of such an ingenious way of stabbing another company in the back i am not going to play the silly game of comparing lives in america vs lives in someotherthirdworldcountry and the different dynamics that brings into play heads up you cannot compare the two so yes when i say the devil buying himself a spot in heaven im referring to a man that had no problem ruining peoples lives over years ago is now all on board the lets destroy polio train never mind saying he was a ruthless business man is a huge understatement im simply pointing out i wish he had half the moral fiber he seems to have today then
technology,not_removed,lana mode engaged
technology,not_removed,lol right good one
technology,not_removed,xp was a pretty simple derivation from nt and then the development cycle for vista is now considered a textbook developer mismanagement problem on the same order as taligent something happened around there i usually chalk it up to horrible company culture and bad management though myself
technology,not_removed,and on the other hand windows wasnt exactly a little bundle of joy
technology,not_removed,ballmer also didnt have a tolerance for chairs the time he threw one across a meeting room amirite
technology,not_removed,its ok to acknowledge his short comings in the while also acknowledging that hes doing great things with be bill and melinda gates foundation
technology,not_removed,and yet the windows through debacles
technology,not_removed,yes it has failed me at critical moments but of the time it works as desired
technology,not_removed,it seems corrupt to me heres one with more evidence
technology,not_removed,im not digging for anything man i just dont put too much stock in a blog site ive never heard of then theres people like you who tell me its popular one guy says its a liberal site and you say its conservative i dont need to dig for anything i dont take blogsites seriously as a rule
technology,not_removed,no one can stay home and think our democracy will just hum along by itself of course the system wont hum along by itself but who am i to vote for i cant stand either candidate and third party votes do nothing seem like they do nothing but i know better than that voting for the sake of voting seems counterintuitive to the process
technology,not_removed,having even less well informed and interested voters is a terrible plan
technology,not_removed,i dont have to or should do anything
technology,not_removed,i dont agree if the ballot options were hitler mussolini and hirohito i wouldnt feel compelled to vote for one of them would you should everyone be informed and engaged in every election absolutely but ive happily abstained from voting for a president when i felt like there was no option i could happily endorse
technology,not_removed,eh utopia probably isnt possible because people are dicks
technology,not_removed,utopia is a pun it comes from the greek meaning the good place and a similar sounding greek phrase meaning the place that can never be
technology,not_removed,i wouldnt disagree seems we cant contemplate more than two parties having anything of value to say or do
technology,not_removed,because the press by and large colluded directly with her campaign for talking points as shown in the dnc email leaks it is a big deal and if its accepted by the voting public just lowers the standards for ethical behavior by our politicians even further
technology,not_removed,you arent wrong not in the slightest i find politics very frustrating for just this fact its just that meeting campaign promises seemingly never ever happens i know a large part of that is the ultimately cynical nature of politics and how people very often say something simplistic and likely impossible to get elected but i also believe that the external realities are very harsh oddly i will disagree with one thing i think obama threw promises less like confetti than most he was very vague about some things usually just saying hope and change and basing his platform on im not bush i actually think it was amazing how he convinced people he was going to grant their wishes while never actually promising much beyond his base platform its a brilliant way to run as a reform candidate and works when the current candidate has been in office full term and the electorate has grown weary what happens is that people start thinking your vague proposals have concrete implications thats how you get people even though some things were never promised i dont completely disagree though in that i think he way overpromised on those things he did concretely set down if you like your policy you can keep your policy is a good example guantanamo is another immigration reform i mean he didnt come with crafted legislation for obamacare he just demanded it be done and let congress write it he claimed no tax increases and yet it is riddled with them and the only way that it made it through the supreme court is that it is deemed a tax increase that was a huge over promised point he severely divided the nation and the government with that process as there were angry protests all summer before it passed and it went through with precisely zero republican votes some other promises the most open white house and an end to partisanship etc were destroyed by his political machine and his own inexperience at compromise obama has a habit of poisoning the well making it so that anyone who compromises with him looks bad to their constituents nobody will sign on to any initiative if it means they wont get reelected so to craft compromise legislation requires give and take when the stimulus bill came up and obama was doling out federal dollars to any democrat who wanted to support a donor in their district he refused to include congressional republicans on anything when someone asked about this his chief of staff said fuck em we have the votes thats not hyperbole they were really that dismissive of the minority rahm emmanuel actually said the words fuck em to the opposition when they asked to be included read woodwards book on the budget negotiations two years later boehner and obama look like a couple of clowns whacking each other over the head with rubber mallets it was a pathetic example of what was wrong with federal leadership this tonedeafness is a lot of what happened to the promises that were made obama had a supermajority in the senate and owned both houses yet all he ever got done was obamacare and a stimulus bill nobody was willing to work with him after that so while i contend that there was no way he could have delivered his promised immigration reform for example because of the political climate about it he also caused that political climate by spending all of his immense political capital up front on the most divisive bills he could possibly pursue i still say he didnt mean to renege on most of his promises they just became impossible to fulfill even if he caused some of that himself heh to long sorry i dont mean to be preachy
technology,not_removed,you are certainly right and i hope time only creates more minds like ours i wasnt a bernie supporter but only because i didnt think his way would be accepted which sadly ended up being true i believe that you can only say how developed a country is by looking at the standard of living of the poorest people i also believe that we will have to start caring for the betterment of everyone or the human species wont survive for long even stephen hawking shared this same belief in his last ama i just dont believe it can be done with force the way bernie intended however i am starting to lose hope that people will come to their senses on their own
technology,not_removed,depending on the airline you can fly as late as months and it is not uncommon for birth to occur sooner than that
technology,not_removed,til when less than a dozen other countries do it with restrictions thats common around the world did you even look at that link it basically corroborated exactly what the person you replied to said the us and canada are basically the only first world countries that just hand out citizenship for crapping out a little monster on their soil
technology,not_removed,i dont remember saying anything about it not being true i was wondering if you think its a good idea and why
technology,not_removed,just to put the john d rockefellers net worth into perspective were now onto generation of the family there are well over people in the lineage and each are still valued at well over million technically generation though i dont think any of them are old enough to have inherited anything yet
technology,not_removed,we definitely still remember him in arkansas where i grew up one of the best boy scout summer camps in the country is there and named after him ive seen one of his descendants give a small speech somewhere but i cant remember the occasion
technology,not_removed,historically popes arent exactly the best examples of innocent men in power
technology,not_removed,what exactly did he do
technology,not_removed,oh he made some people experience first world poverty as if it was entirely his fault they had no savings and couldnt find work elsewhere lol what hes saving millions of lives millions
technology,not_removed,i usually chalk it up to horrible company culture and bad management yay for stack ranking
technology,not_removed,he was way past the ballmer peak at that point
technology,not_removed,especially windows
technology,not_removed,will probably fail you if trump gets elected
technology,not_removed,the article adds that there is no evidence of any link between mrs clintons involvement in the case and the banks donations to the bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation or its hiring of mr clinton sounds super suspicious
technology,not_removed,i dont take blogsites seriously as a rule eh cant argue with you there
technology,not_removed,you make a choice you make a decision who do you agree with more no one will ever agree with another there is such a thing as getting more involved too volunteering in the political process working for candidates etc our founding fathers didnt let others do the work for them
technology,not_removed,but who am i to vote for i cant stand either candidate and third party votes do nothing seem like they do nothing but i know better than that well if you know better than that and if theres a candidate that makes sense for you just vote for them ill tell ya from experience its actually pretty satisfying but fundamentally i agree with you i dont vote just for the sake of voting in any event to touch on the party thing lets say you fundamentally agree with the green or libertarian parties or something like that far more than current democrat or republican id think there are a lot of americans who probably do side with some alternative success in an election isnt necessarily about getting your person in the white house its a longer game than that lets assume that party president in is a long shot not an unreasonable assumption can already be looking ahead to at that point if people are disappointed with trump or clinton party is a lot more plausible if they know the last time around they were at least a presence and now can take the stage in debates etc
technology,not_removed,you are correct we all need to inform and educate ourselves about the process and the candidates that is our responsibility to keep our country strong
technology,not_removed,you dont think you have a responsibility to help maintain our democracy
technology,not_removed,do you vote for your representatives your senators your mayor governor dog catcher anyone men and women have died for you to have the right to vote remember that
technology,not_removed,voting for more than two parties isnt how our system functions
technology,not_removed,i cant take credit for the below information its been passed around the internet so many times i wouldnt dare try to attribute it but i will say i didnt write it it should give you a feeling for who gates was when he was at the helm of microsoft bill gates was a ruthless cutthroat businessman who made his vast wealth by using every dirty trick in the book and inventing a few new dirty tricks along the way and then using microsofts success to effectively hold the computer industry hostage for years he viewed any successful nonmicrosoft software as a threat even if that software was for windows and if that software was crossplatform he viewed it as an existential threat since it lessened peoples dependence on microsoft internet explorer microsoft didnt make it they completely missed the boat on the world wide web and with the popularity of the netscape navigator web browser which was available on almost every computer from sgi workstations to macs to windows pcs bill gates co saw a threat to microsofts dominance so they rushed to get their own web browser by buying one from a company called spyglass software now since netscape navigator cost money everyone assumed microsoft would charge for internet explorer and microsofts contract with spyglass software promised to give spyglass a cut of whatever money they made from internet explorer sales so what did microsoft do they released internet explorer for free which was something none of their competitors could do since microsoft had such deep pockets spyglass software was ruined and so was netscape eventually once internet explorer was available microsoft threatened not to sell windows to any pc manufacturer that bundled netscape navigator which would later get them in trouble with the department of justice and the eu directx began life as an opengl knockoff that would microsoft hoped lockin developers to windows hell microsoft was so afraid of opengl since it was cross platform and the industry standard at the time that they offered to partner with sgi creator of opengl on a new cross platform graphics library called firegl except that microsoft had no intention of actually releasing firegl they hoped working on firegl would distract sgi from advancing opengl long enough to let directx then called catch up to it and when their plan worked microsoft just up and abandoned firegl when accelerators were new which are now called gpus there was a much larger number of companies developing desktop gpus than the nvidiaamdintel triopoly we have today and many of them were too small to afford to create their own full opengl implementations since most pc gpus at the time only implemented a small subset of opengl in hardware microsoft wrote a full software opengl implementation and then offered it to gpu companies so those companies could just replace the parts that their gpu implemented in hardware and still have a full opengl driver once they had all spent a good deal of time doing this microsoft actually refused to license any of their opengl code for release effectively guaranteeing that smaller gpu companies would only have support for directx video for windows vfw now called windows media or whatever only came into being because microsoft literally stole the source code to quicktime for windows both microsoft and intel were having a hard time getting video to play smoothly on pcs when apple surprised them both by releasing quicktime for windows a port of their quicktime video framework for macintosh quicktime for windows could to smooth video playback on ordinary pcs with no special hardware and microsoft and intel were caught completely off guard by it apple had contracted out to a party company to do the windows port of quicktime so what did ms do they went to the same company and gave them a ton of money to develop video for windows but an insanely short schedule knowing full well that the company would essentially have to reuse a lot of the quicktime for windows source code to get the project done on time when apple found out their contract with the other company stated that apple owned all the quicktime for windows source code they went ballistic and sued microsoft microsoft had been caught redhanded and knew that apple had them by the balls so ms settled remember when microsoft bailed out apple in the by buying million in apple stock despite what the tech press reported thats not what actually happened the million in nonvoting apple stock that microsoft bought was part of their settlement apple was no longer on the verge of bankruptcy by that point and didnt need to be bailed out the settlement also had microsoft agreeing to port ms office and internet explorer to macintosh so a lot of people my age tend to view bill gates recent charities as an attempt to whitewash his reputation and in a way buy his way into heaven
technology,not_removed,i doubt ill be the only one everyone with a brain connected to their sphincter will be changing their pants
technology,not_removed,well there was no legal investigation of corruption so its not surprising that theres no evidence beyond the publicly available information regarding amount and timing of money flowing to the clintons and political favors flowing to ubs regardless politicians are supposed to be noncorrupt in fact and appearance and hillary to date has not explained to my satisfaction how she acquired all this money while doing very little actual workvalue
technology,not_removed,the only way youll be able to vote for somebody who agrees with you is by running for office yourself at this point in my life im the kind of dirty liberal my parents warned me about im also very progun not irrational nra pro gun but way more than just about any democrat in office i still vote dem because my being pro gun isnt enough for me to ignore all the other things the democrats do that i agree with
technology,not_removed,certainly a worthy goal but one that clearly wont be followed through on since it wont be we shouldnt encourageforce low informationinterest voters into participating
technology,not_removed,i dont have to thats my amendment right your statement assumes that all votes are equal or actually influence a senators decision money decides votes therefore money political power if you are not on the side with the candidate who was the most financial support you are cast aside we have the choice to not vote if the candidates do not convince us through a strong argument i will not be coerced or manipulated through fear if i dont agree with your policy decision or views i will not vote for you a huge portion of the population does not vote
technology,not_removed,ive submitted a vote for president in some elections in some i havent some ive voted for more local positions some i havent men and women have died for you to have the right to vote remember that sure have and its a right to vote not a requirement i dont believe in making uninformed decisions and i dont believe in endorsing people i dont agree with or think will make poor leaders my right to vote is a grant of the ability to officially endorse candidate x i take my endorsements seriously whether it be what i recommend as a kitchen knife or who i recommend for a job opening at work and sure as hell who i endorse as a president i refuse to endorse someone i think sucks out of some compulsory obligation to vote just because i think its counterproductive and encourages people to make uninformed decisions id much rather encourage people to get informed and if they see someone they want to endorse they will
technology,not_removed,i fully support our military personal but i absolutely hate the argument that people have died to protect your right to x so you should do x frankly they also died for my right to choose not to do x people died for my right to go outside and protest gays but i dont see that as a compelling reason to do so i will be voting btw and i am appreciative of our past and present members of service even if i dont always agree with the higher ups decisions i just dont believe that should be used as an argument to always exercise a specific right

technology,not_removed,ive been doing it for decades not always torrents but i was on that as soon as it came out i couldnt even put a number to it but im sure its over a petabyte seeding is what they normally care about and might potentially nail you for ive gotten a total of one notice from my isp the isps here are now required by law to forward the copyright infringement notices from the holders to customers for about years now i think it was from wb for some batman game though i dont expect it would have been actionable in any way since their logs said they noticed my ip for a few seconds they specified exact times but that isnt long enough to download or distribute the whole game so it would be a difficult thing to prove a vpnproxy is the onlybest way to be anonymous on the internet provided your vpn host does not keep logs of your access this is important when choosing one theoretically if they wanted to prosecute you they could asksubpoena the vpn for the required information there are no good free ones expect to pay i dont have a recommendation but your speed will depend on their service some also offer services where you can set it up to download to the vpn then you can direct download at your leisure now that all said its going to be rare for them to go after an individual that isnt actively distributing tons constantly currently there are some scams where a copyright holder will send a notice claiming theyll take you to court but you can avoid this by paying them directly or right now and theyll drop it this is bs ignore these they want the fast easy money and have no intention of ever taking you to court i hope this helps also maybe check out rprivacy and rpiracy
technology,not_removed,if you are in the us or germany use a vpn otherwise no need
technology,not_removed,just get a vpn torrenting without one is not worth the risk if they catch you they will buttfuck you with fines and they could even sue you
technology,not_removed,there is a good chance you could go on torrenting without a vpn without getting caught assuming things continue the way they have i torrented for a little over a decade without any issues at all although i do live in australia so the risks are a bit different with that said the penalties for getting caught can be fairly severe and a vpn is cheap i started using httpswwwprivateinternetaccesscom about a year ago and havent looked back its a year they have a ton of servers all over the world and ive never had an issue with speed its also useful for getting around geo blocked websites id personally recommend getting setup with a vpn better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it

technology,not_removed,you say that seeding is what they usually get you for and i totally agree didnt seed at all for the first few years of torrenting but after about a month of seeding i had received multiple notices from my isp back to not seeding and i havent had a notice since
technology,not_removed,what the hell are you talking about samsung phones already have more features and lower price tags
technology,not_removed,meanwhile the smart buyers go for another brand without locked off ecosystem or bloatware
technology,not_removed,isnt the iphone coming out in a few months why would they care about a phone thats years old
technology,not_removed,and also half the quality samsung crap
technology,not_removed,im not sure i understand what you mean by that how are samsung phones poor quality
technology,not_removed,hes just saying it thinking hes cool
technology,not_removed,i have no further information on this i just wanted to look something up and firefox showed its unsecure connection page pretty shocking for an organization whose whole purpose is dealing with internet domains the certificate is a selfsigned certificate that expired in february of this year
technology,not_removed,lists on different web pages need to be banned in china and everywhere
technology,not_removed,whats with all this clickbait horseshit

technology,not_removed,pet rocks came out years ago most redditors arent even that old
technology,not_removed,the most demanded phone spec on reddit is a larger battery
technology,not_removed,im im just saying lol
technology,not_removed,a very reasonable get that down to about or and i think they might have a fighting chance
technology,not_removed,nyc very reasonable
technology,not_removed,i guess they are going for a different market segment the part time vegetarian or reluctant omnivore but as a long time veg myself i have to say that doesnt look appealling to me at all
technology,not_removed,the only missing component in the flavor profile was one thats both literally and figuratively close to my heart beef fat so its shit then
technology,not_removed,its not the cost of the patty that is being reflected there if you get a burger at a moderately nice restaurant in new york city then it is going to cost around
technology,not_removed,i am wondering if it would be possible to just add some beef fat into the mix i feel like a fair amount of it gets thrown out so why not use it i understand the whole point is to make it with no animal products but we shouldnt pretend that they dont exist especially if we are talking about bits that get thrown out anyway i also wonder if adding some butter to the burger would help with the fattiness
technology,not_removed,raising cows is not very good for the environment and were not going to be able to keep doing it cheaply forever
technology,not_removed,it looks smells and tastes just like a regular burger like that seaweed that taste exactly like bacon except it doesnt
technology,not_removed,yes i understand that things are more expensive in nyc but if its that price everywhere its not gonna be successful nobody in podunk kansas is gonna pay for a nonmeat burger
technology,not_removed,as someone who lives in the midwest id give for it depending on location and sides
technology,not_removed,i would once just to see how it tastes

technology,not_removed,user response to facebook is overwhelming negative
technology,not_removed,i dont even understand this were letting computers write articles now and if the articles were fake whats to say half of what we read by the humans is genuine news really im lost
technology,not_removed,rantifacebook
technology,not_removed,i dont even understand this were letting computers write articles now it was an algorithm picking out stories not writing the story from scratch and if the articles were fake whats to say half of what we read by the humans is genuine news really im lost people might lie nothing new here
technology,not_removed,my representative gave me this reply as a reason i voted for this measure because the proposed rule that it overturns would have given the fcc regulatory powers that lie outside of its jurisdiction the use and disclosure of the contents of electronic communications are not governed by the fcc under the federal communications act additionally the proposed rule would have regulated isps differently from other individual websites that collect substantial information on users such as google and facebook — both of which are regulated by the federal trade commission ftc under the current enforcementbased approach to privacy regulation used by the ftc we have seen the rise of the internet without the stifling of innovation allowing the fcc to regulate isps differently than other web services would create a disjointed and incongruent set of regulations for consumers its also important to note that the nullification of this rule will not change or lessen existing consumer privacy regulations because the rule has yet to actually take effect edit i dont know why i couldnt get that all in quotes ¯ツ¯
technology,not_removed,good thing issa got he needs the money
technology,not_removed,what if the motivations were for legal spying on the american people now the government shovels money at isps for the search history and can tie that to other nsa gathering intelligence
technology,not_removed,i dont really like speculative stuff like this which is presented as hard fact no one knows the motivations each person has to vote in a certain way it can come from many things including of course bribes or be a more complex mix of things but in headlines like this its always presented as if we know that these people are bribed which is simply not true they may just disagree with you even though thats apparently a hard concept for many to grasp on reddit
technology,not_removed,which is mindbogglingly stupid because corporations do not have the interest of people in mind republicans are all for socialism and welfare as long as it goes into the pockets of ceo crooks while hardworking americans skip going to the doctor because they dont have any healthcare
technology,not_removed,so passed so that everyone has the same access to our data everyone is a winner
technology,not_removed,you left personal data out of the titlechanges the whole meaning
technology,not_removed,they didnt even try to hid the fact they were doing this it seems like they are proud of it
technology,not_removed,now that we are legally allowed to fuck you even harder than ever before let it be known that verizon will be the first to stop using lube verizon were going in dry
technology,not_removed,one thing that really ticked me off about samsungandroid was the amount of bloatware bullshit the phones came preloaded with apple may have its flaws but im glad you dont get a preinstalled carrier pack of bullshit with your phone
technology,not_removed,an excellent reason to buy an unlocked phone directly from the manufacturerie pixel of course the way ahead is to no longer allow unlocked phones on the networkwill the fcc take care of that as well
technology,not_removed,so they directly collect information on a personal communications device with unique identifiers with the purpose of reselling this information got it
technology,not_removed,xposting from user ucoltwanger in a on randroid you can opt out of some of these verizon policies at this page note that you must save changes after each section opt out httpswbillpayverizonwirelesscomvzwsecuresetprivacyaction you can also unenroll your udid from targeted verizon advertisements by gathering your udid from your device settings google ads your advertising id and inputting it into this form and selecting opt out httpprivacyaolcommobilechoices thats all i know of at this point their appflash privacy policy page points to the second link above not sure if theres anything else thats necessary to do probably remove the app from the device if it exists httpswwwverizoncomaboutprivacyappflashprivacypolicy
technology,not_removed,not regretting my recent decision to switch lines over to tmobile
technology,not_removed,important to know that eff redacted their article about this while they do more research after posting this update we have received additional information from verizon and based on that information we are withdrawing this post while we investigate further here is the statement from kelly crummey director of corporate communications of verizon as we said earlier this week we are testing appflash to make app discovery better for consumers the test is on a single phone – lg v – and you have to optin to use the app or you can easily disable the app nobody is required to use it verizon is committed to your privacy visit wwwverizoncomaboutprivacy to view our privacy policy
technology,not_removed,i bought my phone from google and we know google track everything but they do not charge monthly fees so heres my thoughts since verizon is going to make a st ton of money selling our information we renegotiate with verizon my starting point is for every dollar you make on my information you reduce my monthly bill by that amount starting now when you are making more off of selling my information then you have to pay me to continue using verizon once my monthly fees are covered then you will pay me one half of the ad revenue generated by selling my information think of this as a royality payment just like the big oil producers and mines pay to land owners and mineral rights owners let them pay us edit wordstupid auto complete on a phone
technology,not_removed,if they can charge for bandwidth then why cant we charge them for use of cycles on the system that are forced on us which causes the depreciation of the phone and weartear
technology,not_removed,from the flashapp privacy policy the verizon privacy policy and aol privacy policy provide detailed information about choices you have with respect to the ways in which you receive advertising outside of appflash you can control whether appflash collects location and contact information about your device using settings available on your device you can optout of receiving advertisements targeted in apps on your mobile device using the limit ad tracking or similar capability on your device or by following the instructions provided at this mobile device choices page does this mean it can opt out of being spied on
technology,not_removed,we need criminal penalties for anticonsumer behavior from corporations
technology,not_removed,i find it kind of entertaining that people are now complaining verizon is doing it instead of being outraged that it was already happening to them via the google search bar which does the exact same thing
technology,not_removed,in before it ends up being a repeat of the superfish mess
technology,not_removed,wow the spying is just going off the handle full throttle i wonder whenif people will finally stand up and say enough
technology,not_removed,then the next phone i get will be carrier free stock rom and rooted before i take it to a carrier for service
technology,not_removed,time to vote with your wallet
technology,not_removed,this comes from the company that uses supercookies to track everything on phones what more do they need those supercookies are by far enough
technology,not_removed,lpt dont use verizon as your cellular provider
technology,not_removed,and so it begins
technology,not_removed,as long as average joe doesnt give a shit nothing is going to change
technology,not_removed,i was already planning on switching to google fi as soon as the pixel comes out but this is all the more reason
technology,not_removed,the more we say not tonight honey the better the more we spread the good word including advise to switch to phones direct from manufacturers andor switch to tmobile cricket att prepaid the more this will have a real effect on verizon and the laws
technology,not_removed,thats their fetish 😭
technology,not_removed,they did the same thing when net neutrality was thrown out a couple of years ago netflix was throttled almost immediately fios is great and all but verizon is an enemy of the consumer
technology,not_removed,pixel is bloatware free as well
technology,not_removed,begrudgingly i am now starting to think ios is better than mainstream androids for privacy lineage os is probably best though the replacement for cyanogenmod
technology,not_removed,luckily samsung phones are still easy to root and lg exists
technology,not_removed,i dont know that carriers could block unlocked phones unless they only allow you to use phones bought directly from the carrier itself and even then they couldnt stop you from unlocking the phone using an exploit either way im switching to google fi when the pixel comes out just so i dont have to deal with any of this bullshit anymore
technology,not_removed,dont you find it ironic that you suggest buying an android directly from google when its their permissive agreements with isps like verizon that is allowing this problem in the first place
technology,not_removed,httpswbillpayverizonwirelesscomvzwsecuresetprivacyaction i already had all this shit unchecked i think we did this about or years ago when some revelation that verizon was selling our information came to light
technology,not_removed,i am tmobile fucking sucks in utah id rather be spied on and be able to make a full call with out dropping
technology,not_removed,let them lay us its cute you think they even care hell would freeze over thaw refreeze thaw again refeeze again and thaw one last time before they even consider putting the consumer first
technology,not_removed,make sure to charge them datacenter rates
technology,not_removed,go ahead whos stopping you let us know how it works out
technology,not_removed,the impossibility of enforcement mostly
technology,not_removed,dont use verizon nobody is forcing you to
technology,not_removed,or windows using google chrome dont expect any privacy there lol
technology,not_removed,or windows and now windows and as well thanks to microsofts backporting
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,average joe will start to give a shit the moment this blows up because it is such a fantastically stupid idea apple and google started using encryption for their phones after celebrity pictures were hacked so you will sadly have a bunch of innocent people hurt by this and only then will action be taken
technology,not_removed,funny thing is it seems the average joe is starting to give a shit now
technology,not_removed,im on verizon now but will be switching to google fi as soon as the pixel comes out no bloatware unlocked boot loaders os updates as soon as google releases them
technology,not_removed,youre switching to googlenotorious for damning privacyto protect your privacy better well good luck i suppose
technology,not_removed,if there is a way im sure they will find it i know apple was toying with the idea of embedding a nonremovable sim card in their phones although i think it was shouted down at the time
technology,not_removed,i do actually i thought the irony was especially sweet considering that google spies on us as much as the isps want to at least you can get a phone with an unlocked bootloader and strip everything you dont want out
technology,not_removed,go to the second link that is the new one
technology,not_removed,if you live in utah you probably are i imagine all of the carriers and isps backbones pass straight through nsas data center
technology,not_removed,i have tmobile and have had no problems with dropped calls in the salt lake or utah valleys when i travel along i have no issues when i start getting into really remote areas hwy between scipio and salina is where i dont have any signal i have better signal with my current phone nexus vs my former phone oneplus one because the supports tmobiles band your phones hardware can make a huge difference
technology,not_removed,i was on tmobile and had one spot in my house where i sometimes​ had connection i had to stand in front of the dishwasher and no other place in order to make calls tmobile is really bad if you are not on the wasatch front try getting service in moab edit cleaned up typing
technology,not_removed,i dont drop calls much but the bandwidth does suck
technology,not_removed,works fine for me unless im out in the sticks
technology,not_removed,of course this is well known but maybe it is time to turn the tables on verizon and stop taking it in the shorts i can ask and still not be disappointed since i already know the answer i just think it would be very interesting if a very large number of their donors would call them and tell them we want to make some changes
technology,not_removed,i know verizon is only out for all the dollars they can get why shouldnt they pay us i know it will never happen but should be an interesting conversation with them see i do receive royalties and have negotiated those so why not try with verizon i am retired so i have timedont mess with us retired old poops
technology,not_removed,sometimes verizon is the only thing that provides coverage in your area plenty of people are forced to use verizon
technology,not_removed,downvotes some people are being forced to use verizon or have a cell phone edit wow how are people taking this seriously nobody is forcing you to have a cell phone or use verizon its become a way of life but nobody is forcing you to do it
technology,not_removed,only if you installed the updates which i didnt
technology,not_removed,average joe will start to give a shit no no he will not otherwise we wouldnt have ever gotten to this shitty point in this cuntrys history
technology,not_removed,ios was encrypted way before the photo leaks i think the leaks pushed them to start using two factor authentication
technology,not_removed,awesome especially the unlocked bootloader even if you dont use it
technology,not_removed,i just dropped verizon for project fi verizon took forever to close my account i had to call them four times to get it to actually happen no outstanding bills either
technology,not_removed,its easier to control whats installed no bloatware its easy to unlock the bootloader and flash whatever i want as it is with verizon i had to pay for an exploit to unlock the bootloader on my htc one so as i have unlocked the bootloader and rooted my current phone and flashed my own rom and use a vpn on verizon this new announcement of theirs doesnt affect me google fi will just be easier and cheaper for me as well as having reasonable international data rates so overall it makes a lot of sense for me edit i also like the ease of calling over wifi with google fi i get shit cell reception in my house
technology,not_removed,if theres one company that i would mind the least having my data its probably google
technology,not_removed,i dont know where you live but i wish i lived there too i drive on south from west to west daily and a call will drop times i also have no service in my front yard even though it is customer verified excellent signal tmobile has been promising upgrades since october and i certainly havent seen anything
technology,not_removed,youre a nice person in real life im sure
technology,not_removed,dont buy a phone from then then
technology,not_removed,it doesnt come unlocked but its designed such that its simple to do via adb and doesnt require the use of any exploits
technology,not_removed,yeah they always make leaving difficult how are you liking fi
technology,not_removed,would have been easier to walk into a verizon store and do it in person
technology,not_removed,really google you might as well just forward all your information to the nsa directly
technology,not_removed,really they are probably the worst about sharing your data with othersthey have been implicated multiple times now
technology,not_removed,im more on the southwest corner of the valley and commute to murray area for work dont head out to magnawest valley often
technology,not_removed,and what is the alternative did you miss the part where i said that there isnt always an alternative
technology,not_removed,any instructions on how to do that and can you move your current phone number from verizon to google fi
technology,not_removed,former fi user here excellent if youre datalight like i am it can get expensive if you use even an average amount of data though got on fi with the nexus and youll have to pry that phone out of my cold dead hands only issue ive run into is that the dialer can get wonky and things get all sorts of fucked up if you have a separate account with google hangouts or something if youre datalight and dont have a second google account that you want to put on the phone youll do just fine if you use even an average amount of data though you might want to look at options like metro pcs their unlimited plans can be had for as little as which is roughly what youll pay if you use on fi
technology,not_removed,im enjoying it my current city does much better with tmobilebased signal its much cheaper than verizon and the consistency of speeds is much better im a tech weenie so im almost always around a wifi source so the data allowance stretches far i went with the pixel and sweeeeeet jesus its lovely phone i had an htc one for several years and ended up rooting it because of verizons bullshit bloatware after verizon forced me out of my grandfathered unlimited data plan i was very happy to escape
technology,not_removed,haha dude it actually wasnt what actually happened was more complicated i tried calling on my own they told me to wait friday saturday sunday monday to process called tuesday on hold for then they hung up on me decided to swing by verizon on the way home from work hard to do in my city they were able to confirm that service was suspended but they had to call into verizon directly in order to close the account we were on hold for minutes and then we gave up and i was advised to call at the next morning called at on hold for minutes finally got someone to help me and they said that it was basically done and that it would be officially closed in another weeks at the end of the billing cycle
technology,not_removed,mostly because google tends to be the least evil in using that data at least from my experience
technology,not_removed,the alternative is to buy an unlocked phone elsewhere and use it on verizons network read carefully i said dont buy a phone from verizon then
technology,not_removed,it depends on which phone you have but assuming you have the pixel here are some instructions and yes you can port your phone number
technology,not_removed,because im always near wifi i do use very little data i average like a month on verizon right now i also really like the international data would make travelling a lot easier wouldnt have to worry about getting a local sim or phone and forget verizons int roaming data shits criminally expensive
technology,not_removed,they were able to confirm that service was suspended but they had to call into verizon directly in order to close the account we were on hold for minutes and then we gave up and i was advised to call at the next morning thats never happened to me although i can believe it did you go to one of their bigger corporate stores or one of those little franchise ones the franchise ones cant really do jack shit
technology,not_removed,how so
technology,not_removed,why didnt you just say that in the first place instead of being difficult
technology,not_removed,thats never happened to me although i can believe it did you go to one of their bigger corporate stores or one of those little franchise ones the franchise ones cant really do jack shit just a little reseller i dont think we have a corporate one within miles surprisingly this is portland
technology,not_removed,im not trying to be difficult dont use verizon if you have no choice and must use verizon as a provider bring your own device the original complaint was about them installing malware on devices
technology,not_removed,surprisingly this is portland yeah that is a surprise the bigger corporate stores can do just about anything the telephone can
technology,not_removed,i guess that means they can put me on hold and then kick me out
technology,not_removed,verizon is a lot of bad things but ive never had that happen to me either you might want to check their website to see if there are any corporate stores in your area theyre usually staffed with around to people or so handling phones fios and any other account you may have with them all exclusive to verizon httpswwwverizonwirelesscomstoresintcmpintsitesearchredirectstore just make sure you tick the do not include authorized retailers before you hit the search arrow so those rinky dink franchise stores dont come up
technology,not_removed,heh im good though i already switched to project fi im in a better place
technology,not_removed,while that hypothesis is controversial and highly speculative at this point it could dramatically alter the way researchers and doctors work to treat and prevent the degenerative disease is it worth reading past this point
technology,not_removed,nothing wrong with speculation and theories as long as theyre not presented as anything more in this case speculative is in the post title so no ones going to click through with misconceptions
technology,not_removed,screenshot of the population ads maybe its a bad app you gave installed recently

technology,not_removed,if you want to start selling products on your existing wordpress site or you are about to build an ecommerce store from scratch then todays post discussing the best ecommerce plugins for wordpress is just for you before we get started its important to know that there is no single best wordpress ecommerce plugin every store will have different needs and every store manager will have a preferred way of working so while it is possible to make general recommendations the features required by your store will largely dictate which the best plugin is for you
technology,not_removed,for analysis or as a coaching aid
technology,not_removed,coaching aid i know how to do it on powerpoint with moving text from one spot to another position player from one spot to another but i was hoping for something easier
technology,not_removed,because its good enough and for most people myself included thats more than enough in according to httpsenwikipediaorgwikidisplayportmarketshare displayport was available on of desktops and of laptops ive seen very few laptops with a dp connection but almost every one from the last decade has had hdmi which also allows them to be connected to just about any television as well as a monitor and allows for much longer passive cables it seems to me that at least for the average user dedicated monitors are dying out as people prefer the swiss army knife functionality as well as lower cost that televisions offer and ive never seen a tv with a displayport port
technology,not_removed,hdmi is a consumer standard and these are the devices consumers have it also didnt hurt early on that hdmi was able to drive singlelink dvi displays directly without signal changes dp still has a future as a display technology but its only going to be found on high end hardware that warrants its inclusion
technology,not_removed,to tell you the truth i dont even remember the last time i saw a device with display port
technology,not_removed,dp was never as popular as hdmi why it didnt take off im guessing a few factors how much is the dp chipset compared to hdmi amd was the biggest backer of dp back in the day most tv dont have display port off the top of my head
technology,not_removed,becoming
technology,not_removed,there are probably a few different reasons but one of the main ones is that even though display port supports a higher resolution and faster data transfer its pretty much overkill for of the machines out in the wild when the max resolution of my laptoppc is going to be then i dont really have any reason for using displayport which supports a higher resolution also when you connect your pclaptop to a display device like a monitorprojectortv the most common connection style youll find on those display devices are going to be hdmi so even if i had display port on my computer it isnt going to do me any good in the vast majority of situations because the display device i want to connect to isnt going to have a display port input it makes more sense to use a cheaper more readily available connector style in the vast majority of applications
technology,not_removed,because you can do displayport over hdmi if you want so its not the biggest deal if you dont have an actual displayport port and hdmi is a consumer standard while displayport is an enterprise standard hdmi requires no royalties to implement displayport phys have a licensing cost included making them sightly more expensive than hdmi this drives lower end devices to carry hdmi instead of displayport
technology,not_removed,displayport is still alive its evolved into apples thunderbolt but yeah i dont know man last time this happenned we got stuck with ac current
technology,not_removed,thats strange where i work almost all laptops have display port although none of the monitors do and vga i dont see hdmi that often
technology,not_removed,almost every highend video card has at least dp port
technology,not_removed,annoyingly bulky huh
technology,not_removed,other way around hdmi has royalties displayport doesnt
technology,not_removed,you are clueless
technology,not_removed,stuck with ac current what
technology,not_removed,displayport did not evolve into thunderbolt lol intel just used tech they didnt have to pay royalties on vesa and intel are two separate entities
technology,not_removed,your work might be buying a specific brandmodelproduct line of laptops but of consumer laptops have hdmi
technology,not_removed,hdmi has royalties on end products not on the phys shitty chinese manufacturers dont care about following the licensing requirements for that
technology,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwarofcurrents i wouldnt say we got stuck with ac we avoided having a much more inefficient power grid requiring power stations every few miles as for the people who claim edison won because all modern gadgets use dc its long been quite easy to covert ac to dc where needed but cheap power inverters which convert dc to ac appeared only recently
technology,not_removed,tesla learn the truth
technology,not_removed,ac vs dc thomas edison vs tesla look it up
technology,not_removed,theyre all hps pretty much elitebooks and probooks
technology,not_removed,is the truth that teslas use ac motors
technology,not_removed,its not about versus alternating current powers the grid direct current powers localized systems they each have their strengths and weaknesses
technology,not_removed,ac really is the better option regardless of the edison vs tesla shenanigans
technology,not_removed,threephase ac is the most efficient way to power heavyduty ac motors
technology,not_removed,lulz
technology,not_removed,dc is better once you can get it up to mv distribution lines for the backbone of the grid below that voltage you need too many distribution points
technology,not_removed,arm said that companies have licensed the and nine have licensed the to use in their chip designs how about a foss driver right about years ago for that thing id really would have liked to see intel push into mobile phones they are not a great company but at least they supporting instead of intentionally ruining linux mainline support on any device
technology,not_removed,why was this removed i was affected by this and am pretty upset that i have emails lockedlostgone there was no heads up of any kind suckls
technology,not_removed,i hope more people chime in on this i know it has affected more than a few people i am pissed over this i need info from my account and no one will help me get it this is what i have tried tried contacting muchomailcom through email phone text no one will answer or reply tried contacting everyonenet who ran the email service for muchomailcom again no one answers the phone their mail box is full so you cant leave a message no one will answer email talked to brad from proofpoint who ownsruns everyonenet he claimed ignorance and couldnt help gave me another number to everyonenet again no answer talked to and have been trading emails with markmonitor who is the registrar for everyonenet trying to enlist their help in resolving the matter and getting my information they claim ignorance and refuse to help in any way shape or form on a brighter note i contacted the people from enomcom and have talked on the phone with someone from sales there they are the registrar for muchomailcom but since everyonenet actually ran the email they cannot get the info i need either however enomcom have been most gracious and helpful over the phone they have not simply passed me off as a nobody like everyone else in this matter they have offered me solutions to go forward which i am going to follow up on because it looks like everyones info on muchomailcom is gone forever out of companies wwwenomcom is the only one who actually answered the phone and treated me decent
technology,not_removed,router with additional repeaters fills dead spots no shit sherlock
technology,not_removed,how do you kill that which has no life
technology,not_removed,ill stick with my power line wifi extender way cheaper and probably works just as well
technology,not_removed,is it using wds
technology,not_removed,so what how many routers come with that very few in fact this is the first time i heard of a router that comes with them yes you can install openwrt and shit and make your own but it wont save you much money and not everyone has the time or patience to do it
technology,not_removed,how many routers come with that very few you can buy wireless access points thatll work as repeaters and have been able to for very many years
technology,not_removed,uh literally any wifi router can act as a wireless access point and you simply have to check a box to have it act as a passthru forwarding access point sorry i should rephrase any cisco dlink linksys wifi router i say that because those brands ive used in the past and i know for sure that they had that ability im not going to assume its there for all but it should be pretty safe to assume essentially this wifi router is bundled with multiple physical devices and is ripping off ignorant consumers that dont realize the functionality has existed for a very long time in almost all wifi routers
technology,not_removed,sure you can but then you have different networks while some devices can have nice wifi roaming others dont my impression is that this router will give you only one wifi network is this not the case besides the repeaters are not free so a good router with two decent repeaters will cost about bucks too
technology,not_removed,to act as an access point they usually need an ethernet connection some can be set as repeaters but not many and as i said before you will end up with distinct networks with different macs
technology,not_removed,so what exactly is wrong with what i said
technology,not_removed,approx every seconds absolutely insane and wolframalpha also says its just slightly slower than the average breathing rate think about this every time you take a breath dmca requests were filed between those websites
technology,not_removed,the headline is a bit misleading those arent actually dmca takedowns theyre requests to google to remove entries from their index
technology,not_removed,no they are dmca takedown requests to google and like he saidone every seconds
technology,not_removed,surely tumblr will take this down due to personal information being posted en masse if not someone should submit a bogus dmca complaint to have the blog removed in the most ironic way possible
technology,not_removed,really fucking stupid shit from a group with deep pockets who should know better as an example lets say one of these pirates has a stalker restraining orders etc etc stalker uses this published information to find the person bad shit happens the person gets killed by the stalker police get involved and now these antipiracy morons are buried up to their necks in lawsuits both criminal and civil punitive damages are no jokethen there is the media circus and more negative public opinion then there are the reprisals there are some very talented doxxers out there who will be able to track down who put this stuff up what if they decide to take it a step further publish the names of the antipiracy morons families where their kids go to school etc this is not something you want escalating lastly just because someone pirated stuff using my internet connection doesnt mean i did it wifi connections are pretty easy to hack especially when a lot of people dont even bother changing the network passcode from default or make it you publish these peoples personal details online and it turns out their network is hacked well they are probably gonna be getting a pretty juicy out of court settlement and some decent cash for interviews on the media circuit tldr this is probably going to bite them on the arse and cost them a lot of money and bad publicity the guy who signed off on this should be fired
technology,not_removed,they have no idea how hashtags work
technology,not_removed,this move does not paint them as anti piracy it paints them as in favor of legislative abuse and against legal recourse against it you dont fight against something by attacking those supporting it twice removed those people have done nothing against your cause
technology,not_removed,i had a company a few years ago have a rogue employee send dmca notices to a bunch of my stuff i countered and that person then used my personal details to get my business accounts closed fast forward a few months he got fired but my business accounts never got restored and i suffered a considerable financial loss for me this was a bad time because i had a little baby and my girlfriend had no job bad memories and i lost dearly
technology,not_removed,why dont we just open a counter notification service to proxify the requests
technology,not_removed,for me whats going on
technology,not_removed,update theyve taken down their twitter and wordpress accounts all the posts on the tumblr they made are deleted and theyve removed all references to any social media on their website theyre on complete lockdown mode now bonus
technology,not_removed,dont they have a legal obligation to protect private and sensetive personal information pretty sure there is a us law and many state laws on it
technology,not_removed,they have no idea how hashtags work
technology,not_removed,i like how people applaud google chillingeffects for publicly posting all dmca senders info for transparency but get butthurt when a legal company does the exact same thing
technology,not_removed,i was wondering where the chilling effects material had gone off to kewl i have a really badass dmca counternotification in there
technology,not_removed,i dont think tumblr gives a shit about doxxing honestly maybe if the press made a stink
technology,not_removed,theb screenshoot it copy and distribute in other medias and such is not luke tumblr or these user are the only that can do that at all
technology,not_removed,i sure hope this does come back to get them just well before anybody gets harmed by what theyre doing their reaction to the lumen database seems to be something of an emotional overreaction than anything else theyre doing little to deal with what they perceive as a real issue
technology,not_removed,thankfully theres a thing called free speech and everything you mention is protected by it they willingly gave their names numbers and addresses
technology,not_removed,our hashtag works just fine
technology,not_removed,i dont think you could do that from a legal perspective i imagine the person whose content was taken down would have to file the counter notice then again im not a lawyer so dont take my word on it either way though opening a counternotification service for what should be a less burdened legal procedure is sad and should be unnecessary
technology,not_removed,dmca background under the dmca or digital millennium copyright act companies like youtube or tumblr that host user content arent liable for user content that infringes someones copyright so long as they comply with relevant dmca takedown request dmca takedown requests are pretty straightforward you send in a legal notice to a company that a specified bit of content infringes on their copyright and ask for it to be taken down the site will usually comply but in some cases it doesnt like in fair use cases many of these takedown notices are actually automated now as is their processing google for example takes down millions of links a year if the site doesnt comply they no longer qualify for the safe harbor afforded by the dmca and can be sued by the copyright holder if the user whose content was taken down objects they can file a dmca counternotice im less informed on the details of these but basically they tell the site that remove their content to put it back up because they have the rights to use the content at that point the user who posted the content may now be sued for the infringing content or may themselves sue see below if im incorrect on some of these points someone feel free to correct me i am not a lawyer im just a guy with a strong interest in the copyright wars example case in the lenz v universal music corp a mother lenz i think posted a video of her child dancing to a prince song with only a few seconds of poorquality audio heard universal music sent youtube a takedown notice which youtube complied with lenz sent a counternotice in to youtube claiming that the video was fair use which it was later ruled to be and that thus she had the rights to use the song in her video later lenz sued in an attempt to get the court to declare that her usage of princes song was indeed fair use the district court ruled in her favor and when the case made it to the circuit court note the circuit courts are effectively one step below the supreme court they in turn affirmed the decision of the lower court and ruled that copyright holders must consider fair use before sending in a takedown notice the chilling effects lumen database for a number of years theres been a site called chilling effects now renamed to the lumen database the lumen database is a gigantic database filled with dmca takedown requests that sites like google submit to them mostly in the name of transparency from the lumen database its my personal favorite takedown notice as its hilarious abusive this company tried to takedown a giant swath of free software and useful tools from the internet like skype java dropbox various linux distributions and so on note that the personal details of takedown submitter are omitted telling you only that the takedown came from total wipes music group on the behalf of a aborigeno music from de predictably antipiracy companies dedicated to stopping what they view as piracy have hated the chilling effectslumen database for years see the article linked in the op saying that it paints copyright holders in a bad light in reality its just a transparency report but it reveals the activities of antipiracy groups for all to see and analyze including all the screwups like the lenz case or the abusive notice from above remove your media creates their own database an antipiracy group called remove your media has just fired back at the lumen database by making a mini database of their own this time for counternotice senders the catch is unlike the lumen database which doesnt publish personally identifiable details this new site publishes full names email addresses phone numbers etc without consent for obvious reasons people are pissed off about this nobody wants their personal information revealed online its one thing to maintain a database of counternotices but its very different to maintain one that actively reveals personally identifiable information worse the site doesnt even give fair representation to the notices it stores noting only that the submitter claims to own a given copyrighted work completely ignoring cases of fair use see picture in article linked in op
technology,not_removed,chillingeffectslumen doesnt publicly post all the dmca senders info only the name of the organization its representing organization and the state its from eg total wipes music group on behalf of aborigeno music from de
technology,not_removed,httppatchcommassachusettsmaldenwhatisdoxingyesitisillegal these guys are idiots someone should report their asses to the authorities
technology,not_removed,seriously i know exactly how hashtags work
technology,not_removed,it must be a problem with how reddit handles comments because one of my comments has been doubled before and i dont think i did anything maybe it gets submitted but the users computer doesnt get a response and tries again automatically
technology,not_removed,i dont think you could do that from a legal perspective i imagine the person whose content was taken down would have to file the counter notice i think you are allowed to do so to file a complaint you have to be the holder of a copyright or appointed by the holder to act on his behalf i assume for counternotifications it works the same way
technology,not_removed,there is a second delay between the posts i think reddit tries to make a background request to post first ajax but if that fails then sends it the usual way form post maybe the first request succeeded but the answer to that request timed out or was corrupt
technology,not_removed,i imagine anyone appointed to act on your behalf in that capacity would probably need to be a lawyer
technology,not_removed,thats still not how it works the copyright holder must give up his credentials proxies are completely meaningless there unless you want to give up your copyright to a third party in which case you either sign away your rights pretty stupid or youre just hiring them as intermediate in which case your details are still out there not gonna work
technology,not_removed,believe it when i see it
technology,not_removed,thank you mr legere
technology,not_removed,sounds completely reasonable cloe to my monthly bill already
technology,not_removed,if ads didnt significantly affect the performance of my browser or completely fuck with the reading experience of a website or article then maybe i wouldnt take steps to actively block them
technology,not_removed,ive never been more happy about someone losing money
technology,not_removed,all the ad companies have to do is not make their ads annoying this is something that theyve brought on themselves given a choice the average person will choose not to have intrusive adverts if there was something like this for tvs you can bet your ass wed all have adblock on them as well
technology,not_removed,industrypendulum is going to swing to nativesponsored posts
technology,not_removed,good fuck your revenue find a non scumbag way to make money do it for the love the internet was better when it was like this or go the fuck out of business and vanish into the ether where you belong i have wet dreams about a worm which spreads exponentially and installs adblocker
technology,not_removed,they inject ads within ads its called ad cramming one add might contain like ads crammed inside of it these scumbags know no bounds with their scumbaggery
technology,not_removed,dude agreed fuck these propaganda pushing dbags
technology,not_removed,i do have adblock on tv it is called piracy so i can watch shows without any interruptions
technology,not_removed,my tv solutions has been netflix and hulu
technology,not_removed,people wont switch off adblockers even if the ads become not annoying because they got used to adless browsing
technology,not_removed,i dont think thats true the main reason i block ads is because i dont want to be solicited period protecting myself against malware and browser hijacking is important too but i would still block ads even if they were ethical an nonintrusive
technology,not_removed,already has just look at youtube reddit any special interest zine etc and its horrible its all about those ultra native ads where you dont even know youre watching an ad
technology,not_removed,you realise reddit lives off ads right if your wet dream came true reddit would die too
technology,not_removed,and thats a great solution best way is always to vote with our wallet
technology,not_removed,if the choice is seeing tasteful ads or the website folding through bankruptcy i know what most people are going to choose that said nothing will really change until a well loved website crumbles as a result
technology,not_removed,reddit i have not seen an ad on reddit in a while
technology,not_removed,except ads are not reddits only method of revenue buying gold also provides money true this may not a substantial amount compared to costs it might be i really dont know but its am example of exactly a way to make money aside from tons of data sucking ads
technology,not_removed,which slows down your browser eats up your battery life burns through cpu cycles violates your precious bandwidth etc
technology,not_removed,you should have noticed a dearth of crumbling despite the volume of the whining
technology,not_removed,i havent seen any ads on youtube either using ubo my internet experience remains pleasantly adfree
technology,not_removed,do you not understand what is meant by the term native advertisement it would seem not
technology,not_removed,thats his point you dont think youve seen an ad
technology,not_removed,there are posts on the front page which are questionably advertisements on a daily basis
technology,not_removed,i agree with you part of the point i was making was that a blanket killing of all ads will inevitably hurt the websites we love too subtlety and the internet forums rarely mix but we need to be intelligent about the statements we make i think we can mostly agree that there is a subset of ads that were ok with silent static etc and those should be the ones companies use meanwhile those companies should also be open to alternate revenue streams
technology,not_removed,native ads means the videos you watch themselves either are advertisements or have advertisements embedded within them like product placements
technology,not_removed,if an attacker can read you local logs you have another problem
technology,not_removed,any app can already poll the pasteboard service
technology,not_removed,theyll pay a fine that is less that a third of what the scam made them and fire a sacrificial lamb or two but no senior executives business as usual grifters paradise intact
technology,not_removed,in addition to whatever fines will be levied against them mylan should be stripped of their patent that would be true justice
technology,not_removed,this is just a little inaccurate the drug in the epipen is generic its been around for a very long time the auto injector mechanism itself is under patent which is how they justify the high cost there are other companies that makes these things but there is a lot of litigation over the patents but they are available in europe so yes mylan is fucked up for doing this but the government created the circumstances in which they were able to do it auto injectors have been around a long time we trained with them in the
technology,not_removed,oh look they finally care about doing something must be election season
technology,not_removed,what the hell is happening bankers and ceos are actually getting punished lately did i die
technology,not_removed,out of pure curiosity what would happen if they pulled a screw you guys im going home and just stopped making epipens
technology,not_removed,theres supposedly also evidence of racketeering im pretty sure they raised their prices after it went into law that every school requires an epipen on hand
technology,not_removed,good and while theyre at it they need to look into colleges who are in cahoots with textbook publishers to scam taxpayers out of the money that funds pell grants by inflating the price of books exponentially and forcing students to use the absolute newest editions of same because you know how much has changed in the world of college algebra since last year
technology,not_removed,oh you did it now big pharma wink wink youre in so much trouble nudge nudge and right before the election i bet no amount of campaign contributions will get you out of this mess cough cough
technology,not_removed,yall are so cute with your cries for justice mylan will contribute a big chunk of cash to some politicians slush fund and suddenly their reporting irregularities will be all cleared up
technology,not_removed,she is the daughter of senator manchin of west virginia a democrat i might add as well he has countless times said he supports his daughter and the company she represents
technology,not_removed,why wont the feds allow competition
technology,not_removed,haha good now arrest the ceo for fraud and its a good start
technology,not_removed,it would suck if her father was a us senator from west virginia o wait httpsenmwikipediaorgwikijoemanchin
technology,not_removed,i look at that womans face and instantly dislike her
technology,not_removed,the question of whether mylan had misclassified epipens came up during a recent congressional hearing of the house oversight and government reform committee mylan ceo heather bresch defending the companys prices at the hearing stood by the classification she noted that epipen was classified as a generic before mylan bought the drug in thats a good one my years old has stopped claiming someone else did it when he understood that this kind of shit would not fly separately ever heard of due diligence mrs bresch
technology,not_removed,good fuck em greedy pricks
technology,not_removed,i have to say as a parent of a kid who has a severe food allergy and who came very close to dying at school when a volunteer in an after school program unknowingly gave him a pecan cookie i would love to see that bitch go cyanotic while having an epipen dangling juuust out of reach you know for research
technology,not_removed,rip of the citizens go right ahead rip of the government though here comes the hammer
technology,not_removed,wasnt mylan only able to gouge consumers because they had government intervention in the first place isnt europes epipen equivalent about if thats the case i imagine its bc there multiple producers
technology,not_removed,they shouldnt raised the price of a life saving drug in the first place i have severe peanut and tree nut allergies myself they were just asking for trouble when they raised the price in the first place this is karma right here
technology,not_removed,this is a late comment given how many hours ago this post was so it might not be seen but would anyone know what would be the legalities of having a downloadable printable version of a delivery system that didnt infringe on any patents obviously this printable couldnt make any claims that its a medical device without facing very serious legal ramifications but if people are already paying a month for this device i feel like a decent person could have people buy a spring and a printer for dollars and figure out a work around
technology,not_removed,to be honest this article seems like its written by mylan to convince you that epipen is the only option its main point is that mylan is making more money than they should from medicaid on their price increases by classifying epipen as a generic drug since according to the article there are no alternatives but there are plenty of alternatives epipen doesnt even have a patent on the drug it has a patent on the delivery system and even then other companies have created their own auto injectors that have the same drug in the same dosage httpadrenaclickcom httpwwwepinephrineautoinjectcom
technology,not_removed,could someone explain the following sentence under the medicaid drug rebate program drug manufacturers such as mylan can get their products covered by medicaid if they agree to offer rebates to the government to offset costs covered by medicaid what exactly will be covered by medicaid the production and rebates does the government pay for part of the production of epipen then buy it at a lower price
technology,not_removed,i remember reading that the company was gonna come out with a cheaper generic version of their pen so that people could buy it at a cheaper price however reading this article it seems they wanted to come out with the generic version so that they could keep the namebrand pen under the noninnovator multiple source category and just offer the discount
technology,not_removed,nothing will happen to them who are you kidding
technology,not_removed,heres how this works the fines they incur will be less than the profit they made by doing this companies do this all the time wells fargo literally just did this big companies will continue to do illegal or unethical business practices because it is profitable if the fine is less than your profit then why wouldnt you do it theres no personal responsibility executives have zero fear of stuff like this they make millions get fined the public forgets about it eventually
technology,not_removed,this price gouging is universal so why go after this company and not everyone
technology,not_removed,you mean when an organization is legally required to pay a company for a product they have a monopoly on that company will rip off the organization because they know they can get away with it wow im shocked
technology,not_removed,so were going after capone for tax evasion instead of murderok whatever works
technology,not_removed,yeago get millionone of the executives might have to give up a weekend in vegas
technology,not_removed,what grinds my gears is this stuff has been going on for years and they are just now holding their feet to the fire i wonder how many other programs are out there and the people who are suposed to be the oversight are just sitting around collecting a paycheck or worse
technology,not_removed,no it says that mylan was supposed to classify the drug as a single source the drug isnt a single source but the mechanism to administer it is
technology,not_removed,fuck yes i love karma and justice
technology,not_removed,for a single pen the amount of epinephrin in that pen costs about € add on top of that the costs for production of the injection mechanism and its a total of less than €pen add cost for infrastructure rd and patents and you can sell them for €pen tldr neither the drug nor the pen mechanism is worth
technology,not_removed,whats up with this market forces should make this a moot issue just disallow her patent rights by looking for the use of technology in other products and cheating her patent should be easy to disqualify then anyone can make the product and charge a fair market price they go about this all wrong in a heavy handed top down way its fascism
technology,not_removed,anyone care to explain how its a scam when a govt entity gets financially fucked like this and smart business when its just citizens or am i missing something
technology,not_removed,what mylan did is scumbaggish but it irritates me that theyre the one getting all the criticism for the situation meanwhile the government representatives and senators are just chilling on that nice lobbyist money and dont get blamed whatsoever for the shitty laws they pass and the ancient laws that they wont correct which are directly responsible for the situation whether we want it or not mylan is a business and they have an obligation to make money and increase their profit for their shareholders this reminds me of how often time the police gets trashed on for enforcing marijuana possessions arrests the police officier is just doing his job and would be passible for disciplinary sanctions for not enforcing the law hes not the one whos paid an high salary to chill most of the year and block marijuana reforms in congress
technology,not_removed,a commenter on the linked article made an excellent point these companies want to be classified as an individual entity that is to have the rights of citizens then treat them a such they commit an egregious act such as this one dissolve the company and seize their assets
technology,not_removed,funny the same people that are taking this companies lobbying dollars to insure they maintain their monopoly on a piece of plastic are the same people that are suddenly outraged and going after them anybody else smell just a little bull shit here im not even mad at the company they are just doing what the law allows them too do and trying to boost profits it is government corruption and greed that has caused this plain and simple and it is going to continue to happen until people start to realize that
technology,not_removed,ceo is the daughter of a senator and yet this pricegouging shit keeps happening because fuck obvious conflicts of interest right
technology,not_removed,mylan has opted for such price increases—a lot since mylan bought the rights to epipen in it has raised the price on separate occasions i love this part since they bought the rights they didnt even create it or research it or test it they just bought it from someone else
technology,not_removed,hey if the feds are going around stripping patents i dont feel as bad pirating all my media just kidding i never felt bad
technology,not_removed,epipens cant cost more than like to produce not including the cost of labor how theyve been getting away with this is beyond me handsoff on monopolies is more detrimental to the market than regulation on them
technology,not_removed,bringing the current list price to for a twopack up from about a pen not vouching for the company but this is also shitty journalism trying to catch people not paying attention to make it look like the price of a single pen went from to
technology,not_removed,hey cool im so so so glad they caught mylan so are epipens going to become affordable after this no oh ok i am sure glad they got caught though even if it doesnt do anything to help the people who are getting shafted hands over for more epi pens yay america
technology,not_removed,coming from someone who has used an epipen numerous times to save my life this is quite terrifying i dont want the government to piss off the only provider of the thing that can save me
technology,not_removed,they should revoke their patent
technology,not_removed,i did some ctrlf before posting this but its not even medicaid theyre profiting from right about now as in this year give or take stragglers or early adopters laws are slowly being adopted that allow schools and restaurants and other public places to keep epipen® autoinjectors on hand guess what no insurance or discounts on those that are suddenly being stocked all over the place so theyre paying full msrp the intent all along was to get the price point up as this new segment of customers comes into view for them the patients with insurance will still pay approximately the same so that wasnt a factor in raising the msrp price its everyone else that is suddenly able and even required to purchase these to have on hand and of course the point of this article mentions the classification and the rebates they should provide according to that classification so theyre clearly strategically doing things to maximize the profits they can
technology,not_removed,humira is still per pen
technology,not_removed,companies when the government is involved in developing or producing something let the private sector take care of it we will do it so much cheaper without all the red tape and bureaucratic inefficiency it will benefit the people companies when the government hands over control to the private sector we have put so many resources into developing this we deserve all the profit that the market allows our monopoly to earn were not the government weve got a bottom line to think about
technology,not_removed,uh huh pm me when they are actually nationalized
technology,not_removed,so the feds are saying we have no problem with you price gouging the american people but dont gouge us thanks for the help
technology,not_removed,as someone who works in public health cms does not fuck around
technology,not_removed,i bet rwallstreetbets is losing their shit right now
technology,not_removed,i would hope that this would mean that i could finally purchase an epipen at a reasonable price after insurance but we all know that day is a long long way off it is sad that i have to decide between using an expired product that could save my life if needed and spending hundreds of dollars out of pocket epipens are not a luxury or an extravagance they are a medical necessity and holding those that need it hostage with these prices is scummy to say the very least
technology,not_removed,i see stripping patients in the comments a lot and now i wonder what it means is it a legal term what does it mean and how is it done
technology,not_removed,the fda as substances and does not include the mode of delivery if you disagree take it up with the fda in fact it explicitly excludes devices epipens drug is epinephrin under the fda definition of a drug it seems fair to classify the epinephrin in epipens as a noninnovator multiple source drug seeing as epipens themselves cannot be drugs according to the fda definition the real problem to me seems to be the lack of approved competition in this market and the existence of or duration of relatively new patents governing the latest epipens but thats a different issue and two wrongs dont make a right
technology,not_removed,gotta grandstand its an election year
technology,not_removed,would a single payor system have prevented this i was curious
technology,not_removed,i highly recommend reading this post on the subject to get a bit more understanding about what happened to epipens and what is says about the wider healthcare system its always better to get this sort of information from a healthcare professional rather than fellow redditors
technology,not_removed,this is what happens to those companies that bed with the government to extinguish competition serves them good
technology,not_removed,what do you expect to happen when the government granted them a monopoly on selling the stuff
technology,not_removed,as a fan of the show power this headline had a completely different meaning for me
technology,not_removed,either have drug patents or have hikes take your pick already stop trying to use my taxes for your bullshit justice
technology,not_removed,the fbi is a joke anyways
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,ms amiright
technology,not_removed,im confused people thinking they can change anything the financial crisis had no consequences and these guys are little tiny compared to those guys even wells fargo probably wont have any consequences there is only one rule on earth regardless of what country you are in they who have the gold make the rules and are above the law this aint only an american thing at all its in every country no matter if europe africa south america etc its just less visible in the states
technology,not_removed,with a brandname drug such as the epipen which currently has no generic versions and has patent protection mylan was supposed to classify the drug as a single source or brand name drug and then but instead of classifying epipen as a single source drug mylan told regulators that its a noninnovator multiple source or generic drug these ideas are mutually exclusive
technology,not_removed,eyyy
technology,not_removed,if mylan is egregious why not go after pfizer they got busted for marketing off label uses and should have lost their ability to sell to medicare but the government allowed them to create a shell company pass the blame on them and get them banned from medicare instead
technology,not_removed,gasp how about doing something that will actually hurt their pocket book like streamlining approval for generics from other countries to compete in the market place
technology,not_removed,and just how much did salk get for the polio vaccine
technology,not_removed,for every dollar mylan defrauded the government by misclassifying epipen they should pay two can play the price hike game
technology,not_removed,sounds like the ceo needs a new pair of silver bracelets
technology,not_removed,bankrupt the company throw the ceo in jail have the government take over the production deliver epipens to those who need them by unicorn post
technology,not_removed,i think it is great what mylan did they screwed themselves royally this caused many people to innovate new methods of delivering the medicine people need they foolishly took advantage of patients go figure and the patients found a new method to stop paying mylan your greed caused innovation great job mylan
technology,not_removed,i thought republicans passed a law banning medicare from negotiating drug prices are there exceptions
technology,not_removed,heres why they will win the classification the classification is based on the drug epipens are a delivery system you see its not the meds that cost dollars its the pen itself epipens are just epinephrine you can have the doctor prescribe you epinephrine and a syringe but the problem is most people dont know how to give it also what people dont realize is the epipen isnt the only autoinjector out there there is the atk novartis sciele sanofi and the adrenaclick the problem is that mylan holds of the market through aggressive marketing httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiepinephrineautoinjector
technology,not_removed,welp better cut medicaid some more because of all that fraud and waste
technology,not_removed,maybe we should only allow patents on products until a certain profit margin has been made to recoup r d expenses and make a small profit
technology,not_removed,how come pfilzer sell their epipens in the us
technology,not_removed,when this shit happens they should revoke the patent no fine just remove the monopoly theyve been abusing
technology,not_removed,good as someone who works in the medicare business and helping people everyday get the help that they need it really irks me that this company feels the need to steal from a program that helps so many
technology,not_removed,so uh can i get my bucks back
technology,not_removed,the day real criminal charges are brought against these people instead of petty cash level fines we should see some accountability and responsibility improvements on this absurd corrupted system
technology,not_removed,honest question does the military have to pay for epipens isnt that where mylan got the patent from to begin with
technology,not_removed,companies scam and overcharge medicaid and medicare all the time greed has cost the system a lot of money
technology,not_removed,feds should go after medicaid for scamming doctors and passing the cost onto paying americans
technology,not_removed,a special place in hell
technology,not_removed,could the fact they say it is multiple source now be used to remove their patent on the pen
technology,not_removed,so thats why they raised the price it seems that whenever insurance is involved and even more so medicare companies like hospitals pharmaceuticals etc will just jack the price up knowing they will just pay it
technology,not_removed,if santa exists i want my one christmas wish which is to see this bitch in jail by
technology,not_removed,whats wrong to quote mr trump from the debate its called business ignorance and arrogance is going to make great policy
technology,not_removed,arent the people the ones buying it though there are other versions for bucks
technology,not_removed,how about they get court ordered to produce and distribute it for free for the next years
technology,not_removed,what are the worst recent medicaid scams in recent years think about itnylon mylon mylon mylon mylon cause they spit hot fire
technology,not_removed,they should be going after arriva medical for milking medicare for mail order diabetic test strips
technology,not_removed,god damn it
technology,not_removed,i hope that woman rots in haded
technology,not_removed,i do hope this case provokes a deeper look into every facet of the healthcare system not just at the pharmaceutical companies the problem thats not being addressed from manufacturers to hospital billing departments to the affordable care act is that the cost of healthcare in this country is simply too high and were doing nothing to lower it
technology,not_removed,why is this in rtechnology
technology,not_removed,adrenaclick is a spring operated version with generics available as little as per pack
technology,not_removed,while it is unfair what mylan did why do drug companies have to offer rebates to medicaid in the first place medicaid also gets away with reimbursing doctors less for their services compared to private insurance it seems to me that government doesnt have to play by the same set of rules private citizens and companies do as they create laws that only benefit them
technology,not_removed,so what are they being charged with what is illegal about charging whatever you want for your property
technology,not_removed,feds will get bought no more story tomorrow money is power
technology,not_removed,better start looking at the entire medical supply industry theyve been fleecing socialist healthcare programs since johnson thats why a hospital band aid is wouldnt be the case if the government hadnt stepped in
technology,not_removed,trump would say she was a good businesswoman
technology,not_removed,his should also be taken as an example of why we need medicaid reform
technology,not_removed,she should go to jail period
technology,not_removed,mylan ceo heather bresch defending the companys prices at the hearing stood by the classification she noted that epipen was classified as a generic before mylan bought the drug in this is like someone showing up to a bank robbery mid heist stealing stuff and saying it was already being stolen so theres nothing wrong lol holy fuck ceos like this are pure human trash im sorry
technology,not_removed,does anybody else see the hypocrisy in saying we want free markets and capitalism and then turning around and punishing profitmaking companies when they are simply doing what they were made to do we are trying to have it both ways and then pulling the rug out from under these companies whenever we feel like it why not make medical practice and lifesaving services public like schools we all need them
technology,not_removed,this should be under rupliftingnews
technology,not_removed,actually no reagen was probably one of the most patriotic presidents we had since theodor roosevelt yes under reagen the entire insane war on drugs started yes thanks to nancys influence our nations mental health hospitals and care nearly vanished causing an epidemic in late and to a certain extent goes on today which is seen with all the disturbed people on the streets however under reagen the economy was doing well and our enemies were kept well at bay america was the pride of western hemisphere as well
technology,not_removed,patenting something of medical benefit to society for private interest is immoral
technology,not_removed,cost of the epipen raised screwing the people who need it meh stiff the government on some rebate money congressional hearings
technology,not_removed,hows that crony capitalism working out for you folks wave a flagsupport the troops and move alongnothing to see here
technology,not_removed,another example of corporate greed this epipen belongs to the tax payer because it was researched and discovered by the military using tax payers money her dad is a senator using connections to buy the rights to this epipen used her connections to lobby this epipen as a requirement to have in school districts she now turns around and rob our citizens what a bitch
technology,not_removed,what exactly is stopping people from just getting epinephrine and a syringe versus paying a ridiculous amount of money for an auto injector device
technology,not_removed,pay fine much less than profit earned ceo steps down months later reports come out about huge payout golden parachute people forget about all of this epipen rises up in price again company ups its campaign contributions to stay out of the lime light
technology,not_removed,there are free plans for an epipencil which is the same thing and can be made for apparently some doctors are pissed about their patients getting screwed and put this together its really easy to do
technology,not_removed,mylan wants to be martin shkreli so bad
technology,not_removed,fuck you mylan you are a piece of shit
technology,not_removed,is flogging a thing anymore it needs to be a thing
technology,not_removed,how about fixing the system which makes this possible seriously stop allowing a law for which makes companies which are public do everything in their power to make a profit jesus it is infuriating
technology,not_removed,so are we a capitalist nation or what clearly lines cannot be drawn at simply when its just mean and unfair because that dosnt seem to matter anywhere else how do they determine when something should be illegal
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,so the government forces companies to give them a rebate but the companies are the scammers that seems to have it backwards somehow
technology,not_removed,hilary was sick of paying top dollar
technology,not_removed,i defended their right to charge what they wanted for their product but i cant defend this shame on them
technology,not_removed,one other thing the spend their innovation money onadvertising if they didnt spend billions putting ads on tv and in magazines they could use that money elsewhere and lower the price advertise to doctors fine but advertising to the common person is stupid and makes people make stupid health decisions based off of a tv ad
technology,not_removed,bringing the current list price to for a twopack up from about a pen in thats an increase of more than percent its also an increase of more than percent
technology,not_removed,ive always wondered about that person scams gets a fine
technology,not_removed,lets not forget those sacrificial lamb will have a huge pay day coming to them everyone in the company wins people get fucked in the ass
technology,not_removed,yep the dog and pony show only has to continue through election day the congressmen wont need a talking point after that
technology,not_removed,as is tradition
technology,not_removed,this is merely one of the worst examples of a widespread failure of the american healthcare system the real sacrificial lambs are those who suffer and die without their meds or medical procedures which are kept out of their reach due to american worship of a capitalist healthcare system and boughtoff political defense of the abject greed of ceos because we have clear proof of better healthcare options used in other countries its clear we could do better and have consciously chosen not to we might as well be stuffing human sacrifices into the mouth of a giant stone idol during a ceremony worshiping billionaires as gods and celebrating the love of money
technology,not_removed,god bless america
technology,not_removed,and they say white collar crime doesnt pay oh wait no one says that
technology,not_removed,correct
technology,not_removed,but will the price at least go back down
technology,not_removed,also this is just one of dozens of scams they are likely involved in they just got caught here price of doing business
technology,not_removed,i dont think there is a patent it just so happens that their main competitor had a massive recall and they became a monopoly
technology,not_removed,beat the hell out of doing nothing
technology,not_removed,as i walk through the valley scamming people to dead
technology,not_removed,so long as the government gets their cut and are happy
technology,not_removed,well technically scamming is fraud which other than bankers but specifically ceos have gone to prison for
technology,not_removed,i think stripping patents involved in these types of cases is justified you just lost exclusive rightsnow compete with the free market and the innovation that would also likely happen
technology,not_removed,in addition to this fines shouldnt be arbitrary amounts but rather a percentage of reported profits even loss in profits would hurt a company like this badly actually why is this not done at all
technology,not_removed,they should not have a patent because their initial patent already expired they made minor changes and were unjustly granted a new patent abusing the system congress and the federal bureaucrats at the fda are the ones who made this problem and it did not happen on accident they were well paid to rig the game to keep out competitors unfortunately just removing the patent is not going to be enough you need to remove the fda barriers to entering the market and limit lawsuits
technology,not_removed,out of curiosity is there a legal basis for this i agree it is just but often just things arent legal genuine question
technology,not_removed,mylan told regulators that its a noninnovator multiple source or generic drug it sounds like in their filings to cheat medicaid theyve already said that the epipen is a generic makes perfect sense to me that the government should strip the patent and make it so
technology,not_removed,that isnt a terrible idea for when a patent holder abuses their exclusivity it would also provide a great tool against patent trolls who hold valid patents to neuter them without fucking the system
technology,not_removed,youre talking out of your ass how do i know this because the federal government fda only allows epipen to be prescribed and has barred all competitors from being substituted epipen could only jack up prices because they had no competition in the marketplace thats odd given that epinephrine isnt patented and has been synthesized for well over a century in europe there are multiple competitors to epipen but in the united states the fda has prevented competitors from entering the market – and the biggest competitor to epipen adrenaclick is barred from substitution for epipen in prescriptions if you want to blame someone the ones clearly responsible are the federal government
technology,not_removed,the bayh dole act has reserved but to my knowledge never used a right to marchin and take the exclusively of a patent there have been petitions in the past that were declined where patients with orphan illnesses sought intervention when their access to life sustaining treatment was threatened the government has established a history of putting the interests of industry over public health
technology,not_removed,you say its generic ill take you on your word they had time to fix any legacy paperwork errrors especially after the agency told them it was wrong
technology,not_removed,that sounds like a great idea though i admit i dont know enough about patent law or big pharma to say it is for sure regardless though is this even something courts could do of they wanted to
technology,not_removed,they dont have a patent here
technology,not_removed,nah that would mean justice thats not what the justice system is designed for
technology,not_removed,the only reason they would strip them of their patent which i dont think is a punishment legally befitting the alleged injustice would be because they have another option that would make them more money im not saying the company manufacturing epipens is thea good guy here i dont know enough about it to give my opinion yet what i do know is that fee diversion is a sneaky unconstitutional govt cash cow to get or maintain a patent tm or copyright theres a fee the us patent trademark office is funded solely by these fees not by public tax dollars if you have a patent etc you will pay taxes on top of the fees you paid to get it voluntary fees patent office taxes irs all thats cool pretty standard no surprise but for some sketchy reason that i havent found a constitutional explanation for yet the presidentcongress sometimes takes a chunk out of the fees paid to the patent office puts it in the treasury this is a tax loophole but against tax paying patent holders its basically taxation without representation nonprofits charities religious institutions schools and all peopleinstitutions that are eligible to file for tax reductions are not given their right to do so on any fees diverted out the patent office patent copyright fees are the sole funding of the patent office because the presidentcongress might take a chunk out of the patent offices operational budget in any given year the office has to allot for that to remain operational both bush obama have opted to skim the top from patent fees throughout their presidencies our country is so in debt that i cant see this trend skipping a beat anytime soon whats important to our govt is that it appears to be representing the people who elected them whats most important to our govt power money recognition
technology,not_removed,if you are found guilty of defrauding medicare you cannot participate in medicare therefore they company would collapse medicare was one of the reasons why pharma were so happy to shoulder the initial cost of obamacare because the bill expanded the drugs available and it is the lifeblood of many pharma companies
technology,not_removed,totally agree and maybe the fine should be based on an average per user per state and backdated to when they bought the drug
technology,not_removed,the market has tried numerous times to come up with a cheaper alternative to the epipen but patent and fda regulatory rules have stymied every effort thanks to the government it just takes too much money and too much time thus this isnt a problem with a freemarket its a problem with a government run market inasmuch as government regulations are the problem more government regulation seems less like a solution than doubling down on stupid removing the patent protection might or might not be a fair thing to do but trimming the government control over the markets is definitely a good place to start
technology,not_removed,both epinephrine and the delivery system used in the epipen were developed by the government for use in the military so essentially the taxpayers developed the medicine and the delivery system
technology,not_removed,well mylan has spent millions of dollars in lobbying and used its close governmental connections ceo is the daughter of a us senator to prevent the government from funding or approving generic epipens
technology,not_removed,us taxpayers paid for the epipens development at nasa mylan got a patent on it and has been raising its price ever since and the taxpayers rightfully feel royally fucked more backstory httpusuncutcomclasswarepipentaxpayermoney
technology,not_removed,rand paul talking about how the fda has created this monopoly
technology,not_removed,came here to say this im not even sure if its really as fucked up as it sounds they are asked to classify where this drug falls under and there is a generic available the delivery mechanism is the uniqueness but not the drug itself
technology,not_removed,how they justify the high cost they justify it because its fucking legal either have intellectual property rights or have hikes take your pick already stop trying to use my taxes for your rhetorical bs actually just leave everything alone because something bigger is at stake here
technology,not_removed,i know people who keep a bottle and syringe in their purse at all times the medicine isnt that expensive in liquid form and the syringe is just a cheap syringe they would inject it just like an epipen if needed saved them hundreds each year
technology,not_removed,and its not even being packaged as save the children or national security yet
technology,not_removed,interest rate hike coming after the election
technology,not_removed,but oh darn what can actually get accomplished before the election lots of talk and posturing wow senators will barely have time to sell their stock and cancel appointments with lobbyists s
technology,not_removed,its an election year
technology,not_removed,thanks to president obamas department of justice fyi im a registered republican holding those crooked scumbags accountable sadly republicans lately could give two shits theyre more worried about taking rights away from women and keeping minorites and immigrants in the lowest income bracket
technology,not_removed,its obligatory not meaningful there will be no lasting or impressing punishment maybe the pen will come down in price again maybe
technology,not_removed,they arent being punished yet they are just talking about thinking about considering punishing them
technology,not_removed,there are at least two other companies that make epi auto injectors it might take them a while to ramp up production but in months everything would be cool
technology,not_removed,apparently the issue is with the delivery system and not the drug so tons of money poured into delivery system by generics pressure on fda to fast track approval
technology,not_removed,right now people would die the generics have not caught up with the epipen yet so people would have to go back to needlevial which is much riskier and harder to carry around if the patent were to be released and generics got some time to catch up with the tech and gather field data to prove that their solution is effective and safe they could stop and noone would notice
technology,not_removed,it would probably speed up actual government takeover of healthcare in the us
technology,not_removed,im swedish here they would annonser that they would accept competitors to make the pens and then repay the patent holder based on what a boad think they should get
technology,not_removed,theyd get personally sued into oblivion by their shareholders
technology,not_removed,only for poor people you know this
technology,not_removed,what law was broken im not saying there wasnt any illegal activity just dont think throwing out that you want criminal charges without specifics is really fair
technology,not_removed,when the state is involved the market isnt free
technology,not_removed,pfizer actually owns the patents for the epipen mylan just holds distribution and marketing rights for the epipen the patents are owned by meridian medical technologies which is a wholly owned subsidiary of king pharmaceuticals which is a wholly owned subsidiary of pfizer
technology,not_removed,well one of the attributes of the medicaid program is that the government does not negotiate the price of drugs with drug manufacturers
technology,not_removed,you mean like the ceos fathers account
technology,not_removed,its all bullshit we live in a capitalist society and our healthcare system is part of that if we dont want our healthcare system ruled by capitalism then change needs to come from the top down slapping one or two pharmaceutical companies with fines when they get a little too greedy isnt going to solve anything i know its a complicated issue but every other developed nation has figured out how to solve it already
technology,not_removed,greedy democrat cant imagine thanks for pointing that out i havent seen anyone else in this thread mention that
technology,not_removed,good find i didnt know this see already her patents are on shaky ground
technology,not_removed,shes not wrong the epipen was first patented in the the original design is off patent but the modified design that they currently sell is on patent theyre making the case that well we just make one type of autoinjector based on that old design the problem isnt that this much is wrong the problem is that theyve lobbied to stop the other companies from making generic autoinjectors
technology,not_removed,i mean rtechnology is where clueless hiveminders gather to rage and form pitchfork mobs over tech they dont even understand seems like a natural fit to me
technology,not_removed,government has no money this is the left pushing single payer
technology,not_removed,a lot of politicians have families this probably hit them right in the special snowflake
technology,not_removed,i think there would be other problems including the cleanliness of the product if one were to do that
technology,not_removed,breaks its down pretty well if you have any other questions after reading ill be happy to answer
technology,not_removed,medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources if a drug company agrees to certain pricing guidelines then medicaid will prescribe that drug as far as i know which is a limited knowledge the gov does not subsidize the production the government buys the drug
technology,not_removed,nah just one of the hookers
technology,not_removed,the corporate person is such bs theyre enough of a person to get rights so they can buy off government and politicians but not enough of a person to protect them from slavery owning said corporate person or to hold them accountable when doing something illegal such as shutting down the whole company
technology,not_removed,your comment is precisely the problem though right medicine in american mess with my million compensation package and my company will let you die
technology,not_removed,a real dichotomy only way to solve it is with no state
technology,not_removed,off label uses for those that dont know is when you advertise a drug for uses which it hasnt passed clinical tests and been approved lots of drugs are prescribed for off label use please understand that im not condoning or condemning this just defining what it is pfizer was wrong to do that in my opinion but they shouldnt be banned to sell drugs which are approved the legitimace of setting up shell companies for most reasons should be reasons for the ftc to act not the fda
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,then why take the risk on making drugs that might not work if the best possible outcome is a small profit
technology,not_removed,and companies dont play by the same rules we have to shit rolls down hill honestly dont have one ounce of sympathy for these drug companies that charge ridiculous prices for life saving drugs just because they can
technology,not_removed,what specifically do you think should be reformed the drug rebate program id be very interested to hear your thoughts
technology,not_removed,im surprised this is buried this deep in the thread its quite pathetic how the government didnt step in until mylan started ripping them off it was perfectly acceptable when it was just the layperson getting trampled
technology,not_removed,i really dislike people like you you get indignant with your outrage without knowing any of the facts fact cms they run medicare and medicaid something you probably didnt know since you dont seem to know much of anything agreed to classify epipen as a generic in
technology,not_removed,theres a few we see it as what it really is winding up momentum to use for single payer for progress
technology,not_removed,you seem confused allow me to try and illuminate some things for you calling the pharmaceutical market in the united states a free market is quite simply very wrong it is one of the most heavily regulated markets in the world the fda approval process is a slow and cumbersome beast that costs tens of millions of dollars the real problem here is that it simply is not lucrative nor was it really viable though that may have changed now to develop an alternative autoinjector spend the tens upon tens of millions of dollars and half decade to get fda approval only to try and compete against a product with name brand recognition that has market saturation the last company that tried to do this found out their injectors about one in ten million times issued an incorrect dosage so the fda issued a complete recall and that company decided to no longer compete in the epinephrine autoinjector space if mylan had even one competent rival prices would be held in check instead they can do whatever they want because the fda is preventing that from happening you will notice other countries no not third world countried but places like great britain and france have plenty of generic injectors readily available because their drug approval processes arent so bloated so when you say free markets talking about the pharmaceutical market in the united state well thankyou for the laugh
technology,not_removed,wat
technology,not_removed,how so is my work worth less to me just because it benefits you
technology,not_removed,those medical benefits will never be developed if the researchers cant profit from their investment
technology,not_removed,the fact that the pen was developed by the military using tax payers money should make the pen rights patents free use
technology,not_removed,you try fumbling with a syringe and a bottle after you get stung by a bee or something and are having a allergic reaction
technology,not_removed,the company is lead by a woman whos mother or father is in congress using that connection passed a law requiring all schools and various other places to carry epi pens then raised the prices and blocked all competitors from entering the market this isnt capitalism its extortion
technology,not_removed,medicaid and medicare are inherently socialist programs if you as a provider sign on to accept their funds you agree to play by their rules so no capitalism doesnt really play into it when it comes to taxpayer dollars being redistributed to healthcare for the needy
technology,not_removed,if someone pays me to kill you does that mean i dont suffer consequences simply because it was for money its a capitalistic nation after all
technology,not_removed,the government force them to offer a rebate on future price increases that exceed inflation when the government signs on to autobuy their drug for everyone on medicaid seems reasonable enough
technology,not_removed,teenager download music files from napster gets a file
technology,not_removed,we have incentives in this country for rich people to scam people the only exception to this is if the rich person scams other rich people like bernie madoff
technology,not_removed,well if you fine them more for more than they have they couldnt pay for it it wouldnt be fair to have someone in a position were they had to pay for something and then set the price so they could never afford it s
technology,not_removed,govt just taking their cut
technology,not_removed,well yeah anything more would be redistributing their hardearned money to the commoners scams arent easy to run you know
technology,not_removed,theres actually a good reason why the sacrificial lambsceos that go down with the ship get a bonus edit oh shit i forgot this is on rall okay um you know how theres always rumors about companies going out of business before they eventually do well usually the top brass knows about it before anybody else does so you would think theyd jump ship first but that bonus they get is the incentive for the captain to go down with the ship essentially and also theyll have the reputation with them as the ceo that ran company a into the dirt for the rest of their life so the money is like a rider for them until they find another job at company b lather rinse repeat if i spread any misinformation then somebody correct me
technology,not_removed,lube is for pussies
technology,not_removed,except elizabeth warren shell continue to fight because she actually gives a shit about the people
technology,not_removed,sort of depends on perspective from a utilitarian standpoint other systems are certainly better which makes sense from the standpoint of a serious illness and assuming youre insured or if you have something rare andor acute but seemingly non specific requiring extensive testing id certainly rather be here source medical student
technology,not_removed,when do we go all french revolution here i think guillotines need to make a comeback
technology,not_removed,we are special we dont need the pinko socialist medical system that the rest of the world uses free market forces work so much better
technology,not_removed,the feds were the ones that wrote this into law in the first place
technology,not_removed,honestly every single one that gets caught deserves the full bernie madoff treatment seize assets sell yachtsjewelry repay creditors poison the family name lock up those most responsible from wiki bernie madoff years imprisonment and forfeiture of billion peter brother has since been sentenced to years in prison mark son committed suicide by hanging exactly two years after his fathers arrest and andrew son died of lymphoma on september
technology,not_removed,exactly their patent gave them a privilege which allowed them to operate with less competition they abused that privilege to the detriment of society so they should lose it
technology,not_removed,the high price of epinephrine autoinjectors has already caused that innovation though adrenaclick is a thing and ¼ the price
technology,not_removed,but thats not how innovation works in this field patents drive innovation because they prevent you spending millions designing something to have someone else just take the finished product reverse engineer for a fraction of the cost and sell cheaper than you youll never make back your investment and that investment was effectively a gamble anyway meaning youd have to make many times what you invested to recoup other rd losses and then make a profit edit i was responding predominantly to the final part of the above comment and the field in general
technology,not_removed,what so a new top dog can come to the fore front in a couple years and pull the same shit this is where government regulations come in handy we saw what the free market dude to pharmaceuticals we saw why the free market did to the healthcare system hell we saw what the free market did to the prison system and by extension the justice system there are certain things that should be kept very far away from the free market
technology,not_removed,the problem with public patents is that no med company in their right mind will make them because there is little to no returns on it because they have to actually compete which means that no company will make an outofpatent drug and put it out on the market
technology,not_removed,i mean they literally made the claim to the government that it was a generic instead of a brand name product so
technology,not_removed,only fair they love touting the free market as an excuse for price gouging let them actually compete in a proper free market and see how they do
technology,not_removed,wait i thought in the pharma industry this wouldnt even help much even if the patent goes away other companies would need to produce things and have them individually approved by a very long and expensive federal drug approval process once the patent expires there wont suddenly be competition it would still take years
technology,not_removed,you just lost exclusive rightsnow compete with the free market i cant believe this is being upvoted they already are competing with the free market their competitors are twinject for example and adrenaclick and tevas model that failed to meet regulations and others the real reason mylan is the major provider is because the alternative companies just plain suck and removing a patent will not fix that youre just striking out blindly which is a huge reason a lot of people have problems with regulators
technology,not_removed,i think stripping patents involved in these types of cases is justified sois this sop in these sort of cases
technology,not_removed,that happens in canada as a brand name drug product maker you have to provide information on how to make your drug to the generic companies so that they can make it easily and have it ready to go the day your patent expires about five years ago a brand name company didnt do this well enough gave out shitty notes so the generics sued them over it and the government broke the patent years early over it and started letting generics make it early im pretty sure it was pfizer and over candesartan maybe viagra but i cant remember it was awhile ago and i just woke up
technology,not_removed,why is that is the generic just not selling well or are they having trouble producing a generic i dont know much about the differences in generic vs brand name drugs
technology,not_removed,is nothing especially as theyve been doing it for years imo the fines have to be a multiple of what was gained in the crime if they made and only got fined theyre going to do it again if the fine is only dr evil would do it again
technology,not_removed,yeah no a fine of reported profits would be zero as theyd doctor their books to show no profit now a percentage of gross revenue now youre talking
technology,not_removed,fuck of profit charge them of revenue
technology,not_removed,of last years reported profits if it that years or next years whoops look who put a lot into new office remodeling and rd or writing off millions in legal expenses or lost to large bonuses lots of ways to eliminate profit movie studios are famous for this with it called hollywood accounting which is why if you ever become a movie star ask for a of gross not profit
technology,not_removed,i think you mean revenue loss in profits is basically incapable of hurting anyone
technology,not_removed,it should be a percentage of revenue if you made it a percentage of profit youll be stuck in courts forever
technology,not_removed,i agree as it stands companies like this view these fines and penalties as a cost of doing business its not a deterrent its built into their business model
technology,not_removed,what percentage of their profits are from epipens is probably still worth it
technology,not_removed,grass jesus dude that blows i didnt even know you could be allergic to grass is there any kind of physical therapy for it
technology,not_removed,have your doctor prescribe you adreniclick basically the same thing at of the price you have to ask for it specifically though because pharmacists cannot substitute adreniclick for an epipen prescription due to fda prescribing rules
technology,not_removed,cant you ask your doctor for a prescription for one of the alternatives or are they too different
technology,not_removed,epipens are not good forever the drug in them is unstable and needs to be replaced regularly if you can at least but two new ones for the sake of your health
technology,not_removed,i think the date stamped on them is for years im not sure what that means in reality if you use one that is years old it probably is better to keep around than not having one
technology,not_removed,i agree with most of your comment but lower barriers to entry in the drug market are not a good idea the teva generic was rejected due to inconsistent dosing do you really want stuff on the market that might not deliver the correct amount of drug even with the high barriers to entry we get stuff like yaz or vioxx that make it to market but prove to be too dangerous to stay there do you really want the free market to determine which drugs are safe where taking a new drug is a serious gamble no thanks
technology,not_removed,there is a legal basis look into the bayh dole act marchin provision government supported research is subject to marchin if it is necessary for public benefit and the private interests are abusing the patent iirc it has never been used
technology,not_removed,the drug in the epipen is generic i dont see this case having much of a leg to stand on
technology,not_removed,epinephrine is just a synthetic adrenaline and was first synthesized in germany or england depending on who you ask the first auto injector was created by for the military but has been improved upon by the drug companies not defending mylan just pointing out why theyve been legally allowed to profit edit auto injectors were developed by a private company for the military
technology,not_removed,the delivery system used in the epipen were developed by the government for use in the military false maybe developed for the government but not by the government the autoinjector technology used by the epipen was developed by sheldon kaplan while working at survival technology inc survival technology did produce autoinjectors for the dod for nerve agent antidote kits because they were the first company to develop an autoinjector with a glass drug container at the time most autoinjectors used a stainless steel drug container and many drugs would not remain stable when in contact with stainless steel kaplan completely redesigned the existing autoinjectors to accomodate the glass container the main problem was breaking the container which allowed a wider range of drugs to be used
technology,not_removed,source how does mylan own the autoinjector patent
technology,not_removed,oh the joys of atropine injectors
technology,not_removed,drugs work this way tax money gives the university students research grants to develop the tech then taxes are used to give a rebate on the drug there are probably other ways too but by the time youve bought a drug youve already paid for it multiple ways why do companies get to take advantage of taxpayer money to be developed but the taxpayer doesnt reap the profits if the government is giving money to these companies directly or indirectly the government should own shares like any other investor
technology,not_removed,the club is real
technology,not_removed,did you not read the article the epipen was not developed at nasa it was developed at survival technology inc the engineer that helped refine the autoinjector did work at nasa prior to working at survival technology
technology,not_removed,the only way to be successful in this world is to sell your soul and become a piece of shit honest hard working good people can only hope lead modest middleclass lives at best the only consolation is at least those people get to sleep with a clean conscience and will die happily without looking back at their lives with any regret because their focus wasnt on hoarding papers and numbers but rather family and making the world a better place
technology,not_removed,the problem with paul is that he would use this as a reason to deregulate the fda and cut its power and not to change it in favor of fairer competition
technology,not_removed,no this is under the save the children these things are damn expensive and a lot of families with kids who have food allergies go without
technology,not_removed,ofc you can have the stock markets adjust to higher interest rates before the election people might actually realize how big this bubble has grown and vote for someone who isnt an incumbent
technology,not_removed,too bad we didnt have years of this too little too late imo
technology,not_removed,there are already alternatives available this is not a problem with the technology not being available its some weird bullshit with the united states healthcare system in the uk we have different adrenaline auto injectors that can be prescribed epipen is one of them but they are all pretty much the same if there were a similar price hike here the doctors would just click on a different box on their prescription writing computer and thatd be all
technology,not_removed,adrenaclick requires one more step than epipen just an extra cap that needs to be removed youre saying that would cause people to go back to syringe and vial
technology,not_removed,not to mention that she got a degree based on who her family was in in the first place instead of earning one
technology,not_removed,simply make the financial consequences serious enough to render them poor then we can have the criminal consequences
technology,not_removed,just like the wells fargo scandal right
technology,not_removed,youre right about that its so goddamn infuriating that both colleges and healthcare providers pull this bullshit they know full well that since the moneys not coming directly out of the pocket of the person who is receiving the goods or services that person is less likely to question why the cost is what it is add that to the fact that uncle same rarely bounces checks and you have the perfect setup to fleece taxpayers by inflating the costs involved arbitrarily
technology,not_removed,even if medicaid could negotiate prices it would have virtually no negotiating power due to the fact that medicaid cannot not unilaterally drop coverage of a drug making it unable to use walking out of negotiations as leverage basically medicaids position as a governmentfunded social insurance gives it an inherently weak position for negotiating drug prices
technology,not_removed,that would be an interesting conflict of interest if the senate committee that holds the hearings also has joe manchin as a member
technology,not_removed,we live in a capitalist society no actually we live in an oligarchy
technology,not_removed,thats something i didnt think about given that the patented delivery is a simple plastic springtube design i was more thinking about the mechanical side of things but absolutely the sterile needle and medical grade whatever involved is something to take into consideration im not an engineer or doctor im nothing even close but this is exactly why i wanted to try and start a dialog i know theres a ton of variables i havent even thought of which is why there is a monopoly on the device thanks for the input dude
technology,not_removed,the law setup a punishment and pfizer took the risk and when they got caught they were able to avoid the penalty they were in fact found guilty and skirted the ramifications of it the government found they were too big to punish and let them off completely the point is why have a punishment if it does not apply equally
technology,not_removed,because a small profit is better than no profit especially when that profit is still millions of dollars if they want to charge astronomical prices on something they can go sell sneakers but when dealing with peoples lives and a government sponsored monopoly i think millions in profit is more than fair
technology,not_removed,i think in general any time we have guaranteed payment for a service or product the price of the product will increase significantly this applies in almost every market healthcare education farming i agree there need to be safety nets but we could control the out of control pricing if we at limits on what we as a country are willing to pay for some of these services healthcare we all know the price listed is not the price paid by insurance yet we are still responsible to cover that cost at what ever our coinsurance rate ishe interference of the government subsidies int this rices cost higher prior to i paid for millionyear of coverage with a max out of pocket expense of and i paid the first of bills then the government got involved and i was forced off my plan because i was supposed to be covered by my parents insurance now until i was the thing was you had to have been covered prior to the age of and i was not hereford i now had to pay full price or my medical bills due not being allowed coverage due to the aca when i was able to engage in the free market i was able to find a product that was affordable and met my needs student loans are guaranteed up to around a person so schools know they can get about out of you over the course of years farming subsidies keep prices stable i know a guy that was paid to not plant several fields of corn this year to help keep prices per bushel higher in general im not in favor of government subsidies in any shape or form as they distort the market and do not allow prices to reach proper equilibrium
technology,not_removed,ya but you just claimed the arguments moral high ground without citing your sources im impressed
technology,not_removed,whats interesting is you cant even call mylan a monopoly becuase they dont stop other companies from making a competitive product nor try to prevent it the fda is doing a pretty good job themselves error in should be perfectly acceptable risk in my opinion
technology,not_removed,not free but not the same price of an iphone either it should be within a affordable price we dont want kids die because they cant pay for a life saving pen sounds reasonable
technology,not_removed,its her father senator joe manchin of wv she was also awarded an mba from wvu that she did not actually complete when he was governor of the state caused a big scandal around iirc
technology,not_removed,from what i understand they force them to offer a rebate on price increases in addition to a fixed rebate of around i mean your phrase says it all force to offer kinda like the mob forces a restaurant owner to offer some gifts because you know restaurants can burn down and other bad things can happen
technology,not_removed,ill have you know our music company was majorly impacted by this malicious unauthorised access to our creative assets and that this criminal mastermind who accessed our ¢ download cost us at least legal fees s
technology,not_removed,thats an expensive file
technology,not_removed,thanks lars
technology,not_removed,yeah but if he didnt pirate it then he would have bought the cd at the store times at a cd thus the punishment is fair s
technology,not_removed,its never about downloading when there are massive fines its about distribution
technology,not_removed,wealthy people everyone else
technology,not_removed,that file probably has the worst resale value of all time
technology,not_removed,bernie madoff was scamming everyday people retirement pensions etc it wasnt just rich people getting ripped
technology,not_removed,this is the real answer
technology,not_removed,where do i sign up to be the fall guy give me a dozen or so million id take a light jail sentance
technology,not_removed,and also theyll have the reputation with them as the ceo that ran company a into the dirt for the rest of their life i think you mean the rest of the month has there ever been a problem with a shitty ceo getting another job i say shitty only to mean not worth being paid the employees in the company that actually do the work
technology,not_removed,warrens cast herself in with the establishment democrats shell continue to fight as much as the dnc needs to maintain their facade of progressive politics an eternal outlier by design
technology,not_removed,sometimes i feel like she and sanders are the only good human beings in our government
technology,not_removed,warren for president screw clinton we need a real attack dog like warren leading this country
technology,not_removed,riiiiight
technology,not_removed,haha
technology,not_removed,well see
technology,not_removed,from the standpoint of a serious illness and assuming youre insured or if you have something rare andor acute but seemingly non specific requiring extensive testing so if youre poor and have those things youre fucked great system
technology,not_removed,and then broke for the rest of your life much better
technology,not_removed,nothing like seeing your fellow board of directors head fall into a basket to make some life changing decisions
technology,not_removed,yup market forces indeed unconscious and bleeding time to shop around for the best medical care need drug x but theres no generic lets let the market set the price living with an expensive disease your whole life im sure someone will figure out how to make that profitable
technology,not_removed,except they have to my understanding of the market share and the government entities to block competition from forming remind me again how its free
technology,not_removed,what ifthe fedsarethe corporations
technology,not_removed,the only reason he got that was he ripped off other mega rich people similar financial criminals who ripped off regular people got nothing
technology,not_removed,and his daughter is working at a diner for minimum wage oh wait thats just a tv show
technology,not_removed,this is actually one of the few times in my time online the suggested punishment really does fit the crime
technology,not_removed,public domain should be the threat levied and the penalty applied
technology,not_removed,all haters should realize patents are a privilege not a right
technology,not_removed,poetic justice
technology,not_removed,doubt it really could happen any attempt to strip them of their patent would likely be found unconstitutional
technology,not_removed,except thanks to the fda adrenaclick is not an acceptable substitute for script written for an epipen
technology,not_removed,the branded adrenaclick list price is the same as the epipen even with a discount the cost is around there is a generic version of the adrenaclick which when combined with a coupondiscount can be as low as
technology,not_removed,is still times the price of what the pen was selling for in
technology,not_removed,the technology behind the epipen was invented in the mylan bought the rights to sell it almost years ago they purchased a monopoly they didnt have any intention to innovate anything
technology,not_removed,the op wasnt suggesting stripping all patents just in cases where the company has shown abusive pricing practices this would have to be on a case by case basis but jumping the price that high on a drug that saves lives for no other reason than profit is abusive and should be curbed the message is that a patent is a privilege not a right and if used abusively in healthcare you lose it it wont chill innovation either
technology,not_removed,the epipen in question was developed by a different company its research was fully funded by the federal government did i think the only innovation mylan supplied was purchasing someone elses generics division
technology,not_removed,epipen has been on the market since the its no longer driving innovation the investment was covered long ago
technology,not_removed,every time someone spins this nonsense about ip laws i feel obligated to post tldr there is limitedpoor evidence that our current strong ip laws actually drive innovation in any industry despite what the industries defenders say this is super clear in pharma the conjoined issues of the fdas arbitrarily ridiculous clearance process which adds little benefit and effectively prices out small competitors combined with unbelievably stupid ip laws like where you can evergreen a drug by adding nonactive groups to the molecule and calling it a new drug provide zero benefit to anyone but large multinationals and their investors strong ip actually retards innovation and it perversely incentivizes companies to make small and unimportant tweaks to existing products to extend the monopoly without providing new benefits aka your points are completely incorrect
technology,not_removed,free market in healthcare im dying laughing where is my fda approved antilol injector
technology,not_removed,the patent is actually on the delivery system not the drug epinephrine is a cheap common drug the specific type of automatic needle is what they have patented
technology,not_removed,i think in this case theyre having trouble getting the new generic products cleared by the fda
technology,not_removed,the patent isnt the true hurdle and epi is cheap as fuck even with the patent design manufacturing the delivery system guaranteeing the correct dose is dispensed every time maintaining the manufacturing process for tolerance and consistency the fda looks at all of that and it costs a shit ton of money to get approval even if youre just copying an existing product its a huge barrier to entry
technology,not_removed,litigation httpsenwikipediaorgwikiepinephrineautoinjector
technology,not_removed,fda wont approve them
technology,not_removed,because of a combination of fda regulation making it so difficult and costly to bring a new drug to market and congress listening to lobbyists source httpsfeeorgarticlesdontblamecapitalismforyourpriceyepipen edit added source
technology,not_removed,when this is done it is done with last years profits or the average of the last three or five years profits unless they know they are going to get hit there is no cooking that without taking a massive blow to the stock price
technology,not_removed,physical therapy for anaphylaxis
technology,not_removed,had someone bring in a script for adrenaclick insurance doesnt cover it requires epipen so epipen co pay still cheaper than paying for adrenaclick fill price
technology,not_removed,theyre not good forever but a doctor once told me they last longer than what the expiration date states and they only really go bad when the liquid changes color no idea how true it is
technology,not_removed,but in their filings they did not discriminate between the drug and the device
technology,not_removed,but they didnt even improve upon it im pretty sure they bought the company or patent that was making the epipen in the device hasnt changed since then yet theyve made sure to raise prices and lobby fr laws requiring all schools to buy them if a company truly does improve and innovate with new technologies then yes they should be protected by patents to recoup and profit this is not what mylan has done over the past years since acquiring the epipen
technology,not_removed,mylan bought the delivery patent years ago they didnt do shit and the patent was renewed for some reason
technology,not_removed,isnt epinephrine just another name for adrenaline
technology,not_removed,epinephrine is just a synthetic adrenaline epinephrine is the hormone adrenaline is a brand name
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,is a middleclass live that bad
technology,not_removed,the reason people are able to be a piece of shit is because they have no regret dont be delusional there are narcissists and psychopaths that dont have a conscience thats why they are able to make so much money they probably dont sleep because the whole screwing people to get to the top is actually exciting to them ive had terrible leaders that would tell shit story after shit story of how they ruined other peoples lives they were proud of the shit they did and were usually very happy people they would sleep like rocks so much so it was hard to get them up to do their damn jobs
technology,not_removed,butbut deregulating the fda would create fairer competition
technology,not_removed,why are you changing the subject the topic is the epipen and the claim is that the fda caused this problem rand pauls broader goals dont have much to do with that heres a pretty slamdunk case against the government regulation that caused this problem the enemy isnt mylan
technology,not_removed,well the gov came up with these regulations to make the dogs safer i honestly think the gov would fuck up anymore regulation since they are already in bed with big pharma
technology,not_removed,and in this circumstance you can say its for the children without sounding like a pandering asshat
technology,not_removed,come on man didnt you see that mylan is offering discounts that many dont qualify for they are not really trying hard to help fill their pockets rhailcorporate
technology,not_removed,better late than never imo
technology,not_removed,what makes them less easier to use
technology,not_removed,do you have a source for the alternative delivery systems that are or could be in use im not disagreeing with you at all i know the hurdles involved in getting a green light for this kind of delivery system given the nature of it i just havent seen the alternatives anywhere especially because of the circumstances
technology,not_removed,its some weird bullshit with the united states healthcare system you say that like we have a system we dont weve got a bunch of corporate forprofit bullshit patchworked together with enormous gaping holes
technology,not_removed,you are right adrenaclick is a viable alternative it just has a slightly higher failure rate which is why it is not considered a dropin replacement atm
technology,not_removed,capitalism is an economic system and oligarchy is a governing system you might mean plutocracy or oligopoly
technology,not_removed,to be fair no country has a capitalist society since capitalism requires many companies competing against each other
technology,not_removed,oligarchy is what you call it when all the capital winds up in a few hands capitalism is the mechanism oligarchy is the form
technology,not_removed,because a small profit is better than no profit especially when that profit is still millions of dollars researching and developing drugs that dont work out can also be millions of dollars in costs that end up in nothing for every drug you can buy there are tons of other drugs you cant buy because it didnt work out didnt get approved is dangerous etc all those cost money a company could make drugs and have only of them work out that drug has to pay for all the failed research too another company might make drugs and they all fail they wouldnt have tried at all if they only had a chance of getting a small profit
technology,not_removed,edit is that source enough for you googling is hard
technology,not_removed,according to cms they incorrectly classified the drug as a generic not to sound like a jerk but its all there in the article
technology,not_removed,well you dont have to sell your drug to medicaid if you dont want their money
technology,not_removed,well all the money they lobbied to get the fbi to start doing that couldnt go to waste after all
technology,not_removed,well you have to make up for all the lost sales you see because obviously everyone that downloaded the files would have bought the album if not for those sneaky pirates
technology,not_removed,i get that but had it just been everyday people theres a great chance any penalties would have been much lower
technology,not_removed,jail sentence no no no you have this all wrong you just get fired and about million theres no jail time you sillybilly
technology,not_removed,id do it for race to the bottom here we come
technology,not_removed,id happily go to jail for a year for million
technology,not_removed,jail not at all you will get a parachute made out of gold and the finest jewels you also are free to keep working in the industry and since we are all friends you should have no issues picking up a similar position just stay a few months in one of your other mansions until the media finds a celebrity breakup to prattle about
technology,not_removed,okay but outliers like that help us drag the dnc to the direction we want she has more influence than if she left them
technology,not_removed,id add httpsenmwikipediaorgwikitomwheeler to the list
technology,not_removed,hey now dont forget that hillary had plenty of about debbie wasserman schultz after she was exposed and then hired by the clinton campaign
technology,not_removed,sanders for pres warren for vp and she can take over when bernies terms are up
technology,not_removed,just wait until feingold is back in the senate is going to have some solid progressives in it going forward
technology,not_removed,i really hope my state votes russ feingold back in this year
technology,not_removed,i despise clinton the dnc really blew it by force feeding us no choice whereas id vote for bernie or warren ill never vote for clinton
technology,not_removed,im raising money for the awarness that you have a disease a cure no no no silly plebs i just wanted you to be aware of the fact your mother died from the disease not make an actual cure s
technology,not_removed,hey hey hey who told you that its worth keeping everyone alive at cost here if youre dumb enough to get sick you deserve to pay for the rest of your life everyone else has to take time outta their day to care for you and make the meds you so crassly require to live s
technology,not_removed,the idea is that you let the company that develops it get revenue from the drug for x number of years so they can offset the rd cost as well as make a profit then when the patent expires others can make a generic thereby bringing the price down
technology,not_removed,going further than that every socialist health care system takes advantage of the fact that the medicine is almost always developed in america once a drug is approved by the fda they wont let it in their own country unless they cut the price significantly leaving the americans to pay for the drug development cost
technology,not_removed,we should pull out all of their teeth and dump them in the ocean as coral reef bases
technology,not_removed,woah you are right
technology,not_removed,i would suggest that their corporation be dissolved any any ip they have be moved to the public domain
technology,not_removed,are you saying executing everyone wouldnt solve the issue
technology,not_removed,patents are actually a right according to the us constitution
technology,not_removed,are patents protected under the constitution copyright and trademark arent theyre not speech theyre not human rights
technology,not_removed,which sucks however if you ask your provider to write epinephrine injector instead of epipen on the prescription you can fill it with adrenaclick
technology,not_removed,its bucks in mexico
technology,not_removed,and then the fda made it a government approved monopoly by mandating only pens using mylans patented design were allowed to be prescribed by medical professionals for the administration of epinephrine there are dozens of perfectly good autoinjector designs out there by other firms but they cant be used for one of the most common emergency allergy treatments because the government says only this one is allowed
technology,not_removed,and wasnt the development of the technology government sponsored in the first place
technology,not_removed,i was responding to his comment in brackets
technology,not_removed,several patents for the delivery system have expired the problem is that the companies that were making clones of the earlier versions had issues with dosage regulation
technology,not_removed,combination products have to be interchangeable in terms of drug efficacy as well as device safety thats why the auviq was the only interchangeable device to epipen despite being totally different it was more safe and had added compliance features such as an audio instruction so it could be rules as interchangeable all of the other devices such as adrenaclick lack some safety features of the epipen
technology,not_removed,teva producer of israeli sandals and generic epi pens
technology,not_removed,has anyone looked at something like pharmajet for injecting epinephrine not sure how far into the muscle the delivery needs to be made but pharmajet has been used for immunizations i imagine that where it doesnt necessarily go through clothing it would be a difficult comparison
technology,not_removed,shouldnt they stick to making sandals though
technology,not_removed,its not that the fda wont approve them its that fda approvals take a long long time there are applications in from competing companies for competing products and those applications are being reviewed but it can take years its the case for all new drugs
technology,not_removed,thats great
technology,not_removed,its true to a point after a year the effectiveness of the epinephrine starts to decrease but in an actual emergency some epi is better than no epi as long as the liquid isnt cloudy it discolored
technology,not_removed,its possible the law doesnt require to them its gonna come down to technicalities on how the law is written
technology,not_removed,im pretty sure they bought the company or patent that was making the epipen in the device hasnt changed since then a redesigned epipen was introduced in which includes a safety cap that autoretracts the needle after injection to prevent accidentally sticking yourself with the needle after use the needle is never exposed except when its injecting the old version didnt have that feature
technology,not_removed,its that word truly thats the rub who decides that and by what criteria
technology,not_removed,id like to think that all schools having one is a good thing because as someone who utilizes an epipen god forbid i forgot it there was always one with the school nurse
technology,not_removed,mylan actually doesnt own the patent meridian medical technologies inc which is a subsibiary of pfizer does mylan just has the right to market and distribute the epipen
technology,not_removed,the patent covers the autoretract feature of the new version that was released in
technology,not_removed,didnt say they did i said drug companies did and the company mylan obtained the patent from did make changes that apparently qualify for patent protection there are differences between the other epi autoinjectors and epipens namely in the safety features edit not saying epipens are objectively better just that there are differences
technology,not_removed,yep adrenaline is latin epinephrine is greek though some people like to say epinephrine is a special manufactured adrenalin billable its basically the common american word for adrenaline adrenalin isnt a chemical btw its a trade name owned by pfizer inherited from a us based subsidiary
technology,not_removed,i was looking for the source on the delivery system used in the epipen were developed by the government
technology,not_removed,not at all i personally love it my other experience is that to become super wealthy you have to sacrifice a lot of time and family life im happy being middleclass if i stay at my current modest middleclass level the rest of my life ill die a happy man with no regrets
technology,not_removed,pardon me for asking but how would it create fairer competition if the fda was deregulated
technology,not_removed,well the point of the deregulation would be that it comes alongside a loss of power for them that loss of power would include making sure they cant hand out monopolies leaving companies to fight it out in the public space rather than by lobbying
technology,not_removed,and bring in a wave of fake medicine being push as actual medicine great
technology,not_removed,wouldnt that fairer competition be at the cost peoples health fda makes sure that only safe products enter the market if that were taken away companies could just make products that are risky and accept the risks they take also there would probably be significant growth in the number of works against cancer placebos
technology,not_removed,the question you should be asking is why after years is it just happening now the justice department has been working hard in prior years just a quick search shows httpswwwjusticegovagsmartoncrimeagmemotousasandaagcrmretroactivityofdrugpolicypdf etc observation bias that its only in election years
technology,not_removed,as an emt i once got nonepipentm epi on my truck and i picked it up looked at it and was like wtf do i do with this had to ask a supervisor prior to that i had never even been informed different types of autoinjectors existed in years on the job
technology,not_removed,as far as i know their only competitor is httpadrenaclickcom there used to be a vastly superior injector called httpswwwauviqcom that is no longer made due to manufacturing issues
technology,not_removed,in many major industries there is no longer competition cableisp is a good example there are others and its the governments fault they have allowed these industries to merge and acquire each other out of competition and we all suffer for it
technology,not_removed,profit implies that those costs are offset by sales of the other drugs otherwise it would be revenue not profit
technology,not_removed,but you dont even know how many other people downloaded the file so you have to guess make it a good guess a big guess
technology,not_removed,piracy for me is what makes music easy to get into i dont think its wrong to steal an artist thats signed to a huge label looking at you taylor swift but i do try to support the artists however i can i feel like its probably better for everyone if i just steal your discography and then ill go to your show and a buy a t shirt from your merch guy maybe throw a bag on stage
technology,not_removed,ha ha jail time is for pesants am i right
technology,not_removed,at worst youll get a stylish ankle bracelet and a full time home delivery service
technology,not_removed,unless its at and then its pretty much forced summer camp with a loyalty bonus waiting back home
technology,not_removed,and get another high paying job in a year or so
technology,not_removed,if its one of those nice jails ill do it for
technology,not_removed,it would be one of the nice jails too these people never go to any real prisons they go to places that are nicer than how many poor people currently live
technology,not_removed,their female ceo made million last year
technology,not_removed,they go to pablo escobar jails where its basically a getaway resort
technology,not_removed,her job is to make you believe the progressives influence democratic establishment thinking without the establishment having to actually pursue progressive policies in any meaningful way shes not there to influence them shes there to influence us
technology,not_removed,i was very surprised how good wheeler is its weird when a politician actually cares about peoples best interest and actually does something about it
technology,not_removed,i thought given he came out of comcast he would fuck us all he has actually championed for consumers i like and respect him for that
technology,not_removed,oh man that gave me a chuckle fuck schultz so hard
technology,not_removed,i like that s you put on the end of term that all sounds great to me
technology,not_removed,yep im willing to watch it all burn at this point im not voting for her im going third party and praying enough others are as disenfranchised as i am
technology,not_removed,i hope youre not voting for trump hes against everything bernie stands for
technology,not_removed,susan g komen in a nutshell
technology,not_removed,im not sure where i stand on patenting ideas but i do know that our patent system is abused which doesnt help the free market
technology,not_removed,hes just making the point that this is a case where complaining about the free market is irrelevant because its not a product that existsor should exist as part of the free market
technology,not_removed,dont they then change a junk ingredient or something and trademark it again
technology,not_removed,or make hilariously tiny xylophones
technology,not_removed,that escalated quickly
technology,not_removed,settle down there china this isnt the congo
technology,not_removed,and shove bamboo splinters up there nails
technology,not_removed,i dont really believe in execution it costs too much
technology,not_removed,thats true but i thought the point of seeing the doctor was for them to make the right choice for you isnt that why we pay them so much money
technology,not_removed,ive heard most of the other injectors suck
technology,not_removed,shame the auviq got recalled that thing was great
technology,not_removed,dofferent companies teva pronounced tehhva is the worlds largest generic drug manufacturer teva pronounced teeva makes the sandals source have famjly who work for teva lharmaceuticals
technology,not_removed,chaco master race i bet their generic epi pens would cost twice as much but have a little strap on the autoinjector that goes over your thumb
technology,not_removed,depends on a few things since an epi pen comes loaded with a drug does it or does the pharmacist fill it the timeline may be differenthowever the medical device my team developed was approved by the fda days or something like that recent guidance i saw said average turnaround time for first response was days now something injecting medication probably requires more scrutiny and back and forth questions than my product especially since the user is the patient and not a surgeonbut still something like this shouldnt take years in the fda unless there are legitimate problems with it source im a biomedical engineer edit it was pointed out that even though im injection of epinephrine is well known and documentated this is still a medical device combining drugs and a device making it a combo product and therefore subject to different guidelines than a simple and also the numbers above i quoted were for a which is basically any device that has a predicate in the market such as this case
technology,not_removed,no in this case its because fda wont approve them for example teva had a major deficiency in its application that delayed approval until at least
technology,not_removed,my bad so they have redesigned it not sure that the extreme yearly increases in price were really to cover the costs of that needle retraction innovation though seems like theyve covered costs and then some with their pricing strategy
technology,not_removed,pretty much any criteria we come up with will exclude what mylan did though they literally just sat on it raised the price by and used lobbying and nepotism to further profit off of people whose lives were in danger i get your point that it would be hard or near impossible to effectively legislate like this but i do think this is one of those cases where we can definitely do better
technology,not_removed,absolutely i agree but its also brilliant to make sure once schools start buying them that you start jacking up the price
technology,not_removed,so does meridian get some of that kicked back to them or is mylan entirely in control of all sales and profits going forward
technology,not_removed,i like how mylan changed the way the product operates so that they could turn around and argue that the generic versions dont operate the same way as the new one and shouldnt be an approved alternative
technology,not_removed,the person is wrong it was developed by sheldon kaplan while working for survival technologies inc at first the injectors were primarily bought by the government for use in nerve agent antidote kits but at no time did the government own the patents for the device
technology,not_removed,is it that hard to google httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiepinephrineautoinjector autoinjectors were originally developed for the rapid administration of nerve gas antidotes in kits like the mark i naak
technology,not_removed,perhaps the enormous overly obtrusive startup costs of getting pretty much anything approved basically eliminates anyone except big business
technology,not_removed,they wouldnt be able to award exclusivity for certain things which cause massive price hikes in the drug market
technology,not_removed,well you see less red tap which most people dont until a greedy ceo releases a drug that hurts people and then those same people begin crying while the rich corporations have already made their millions and the fines amount to of the revenue generated
technology,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikitypeiandtypeiierrors fda protects against type i errors rejecting medicines that dont work but makes type ii errors worse rejecting medicines that do work there will always be a tradeoff between these two types of errors both errors kill people type i may get you sick from the drug but type ii will delay a life saving drug from reaching the market
technology,not_removed,but do they really wow so many big pharma peeps in here
technology,not_removed,thank you additionally president obama also went after those who abused public trust in their office jobs sure he wasnt perfect and ill go into that later today but as suprised to hear myself say thisi would much rather see another years of president obama even if he failed with foreign policy than a year with either crooked hillbillary or that clown trump
technology,not_removed,purely anecdotal here but the epipen is super easy to use take out of case remove cap and push into thigh goes right through clothing if needed and automatically delivers the dose needed to reverse anaphylaxis in an emergency situation it allows any person the ability to use without any real training even a child im on my phone so i cant locate a study at the moment but my allergist prescribes me the epipen because she uses the best evidence based practice i trust her because you know shes gone to school for like years to be trained in her field all of this being said the epipen is priced ridiculously high epinephrine is not an expensive drug and the auto injector is not an expensive mechanism to produce this is simply price gouging the best way to combat this behavior is by lobbying your representative to encourage congress for a regulation on the prices of pharmaceutical drugs as in canada and europe unfortunately this often is getting lost in background noise in favor of other discussions in america
technology,not_removed,yeah i feel like having a purely foolproof delivery system tested and tested again to where it would be signed off on by the powers that be would take enough trials and time that its the exact reason that some dickhole saw it could be exploited for profit there are alternative systems that either have been or could very soon be developed but because of the ringer that they would have to go through to make sure they are as reliable as the epipen shit takes time and time is being exploited for hard short term gains sorry if these thoughts arent super fluid and hard to piece together its late and ive had a few
technology,not_removed,yes i agree wholeheartedly its not capitalism thats to blame but the lack of it we want competition a freeer market at least those not benefiting from the governmentcreated monopolies want more competition
technology,not_removed,obviously billion people didnt download it because of the pirates
technology,not_removed,jeez i mean they fired him what more do you want jail just adds insult to injury
technology,not_removed,although having some time away from the wife to play tennis could be nice
technology,not_removed,please no what a horrible image
technology,not_removed,you know that with that you dont just wreck your own country but the entire freakin world right you know the role the us plays on the world stage on behalf of the rest of the world we beg of you vote for clinton for the love of god vote for clinton dont subject geopolitics to a trump cabinet dont make the world suffer for your completely legitimate but internal grievances please think of the world
technology,not_removed,some people seem to care more about fucking the system than any specific policy it also always seems to be people that wont be that affected by their choices
technology,not_removed,i was talking about the theory behind it obviously in practice its quite different
technology,not_removed,are they xylophones for ants god no much too large we have begun training pigeons to play however
technology,not_removed,i share your xylophobia
technology,not_removed,some people think aadee goes too far and those people are not the president of the philippines
technology,not_removed,well technically wed have to sink them
technology,not_removed,sure but the right medical decision doesnt always mean the right financial one i havent done any personal research but it could be that epipens are ever so slightly better in some way it might not be enough to justify the financial difference to you but it might be for a doctor thats making the decision purely medically and not considering the costs
technology,not_removed,aside from everyone elses answers doctors do consider the financial cost of treatment it some cases you just have to swallow a bill in other cases if you request a specific brand or alternative medication they will usually understand my dad worked in the it department of a pharmaceutical company growing up so we always asked and did research if there were generics from his company since he got them for free outside of my parents choosing a different brand name adhd meds for my brother its never been an issue
technology,not_removed,fun fact the doctor is generally overridden by pharmacists regarding medication the doctor is there to give you a prognosis and recommend a treatment the pharmacist is there to make sure there are no negative interactions and ok the prescribed treatment also the pharmacist always has the ability to call the doctor and recommend sidegrades so if you were prescribed epipen you could have had your pharmacist call the doctor for a move to adrenaclick if possible not always possible same goes for your brand medications that are not covered also stop using cvsriteaid as your gotos the pharmacists there will never recommend alternative treatment as they quite frankly do not have the time if you notice high copays it may be because the item itself is not covered and you are being charged cash prices for them use independent pharmacies we actually have the fucking time to help you also dont take things lying down if its not covered pester until they find treatment that worksyou can afford source independent pharmacy owner
technology,not_removed,no you pay your insurance company who then tries to find physicians willing to accept their cheap fee reimbursement schedule in return for a steady supply of patients and the cheap fees require more patients to be seenday to cover expenses and therefore you get shorter appts to talk about these issues
technology,not_removed,they suck because there is no reason to innovate on the design why would a company spend money to make the epipen better when someone who needs an epipen can only buy mylans design
technology,not_removed,imagine if government mandated only buying iphones for its citizens will android phones would be as awesome as they are today in this case and most importantly would iphone be as awesome as it is today
technology,not_removed,maybe maybe not the point is that the government deliberately created the conditions that made epipens so expensive and now like the hypocrites they are they are going after mylan for doing what the government allowed them to do in the first place
technology,not_removed,source have famjly pronounced famjilly who work for teva lharmaceuticals pronounced llamasuetickles
technology,not_removed,there are competing delivery mechanisms on the market in the us just not ones that are interchangeable with the epipen so unless it is specified that an alternative can be used it has to be epipen there seem to be good reasons for the alternatives not being interchangeable with the epipen as they have fewer safety features
technology,not_removed,i dont know the terms of the licensing agreement i would assume there is a royalty in place that is renegotiated every few years mylan acquired the distribution rights after acquiring the generics division of merck kgaa for billion euros billion in a subsidiary of merck kgaa named dey held the distribution rights beginning in after they reached a deal with meridian medical technologies meridian medical technologies was formed in after survival technologythe original developer and patent holder of the autoinjector merged with a company called brunswick biomedical
technology,not_removed,kinda like adding acetaminophen to a drug and renewing a drug patent
technology,not_removed,thank you that is what i was getting at when i asked for a source as i knew it was a false statement
technology,not_removed,they were developed by a private company and the product was sold to the government they were not developed by the government as ucladari stated which is exactly what i was questioning when i asked for a source
technology,not_removed,yeah now i can finally market big uncle jims crazy epinephrine pens from my garage dont ask questions about the source of my epinephrine
technology,not_removed,thanks for the insight i guess i never thought of it like that but wouldnt the benefit of having safer drugs after rigorous testing outweigh the benefit of cheaper drugs
technology,not_removed,i dont think i follow drug manufacturers dont see red tape unless they are greedy ceos
technology,not_removed,for medicine type i errors are way worse than type ii errors type ii only cause problems when all alternatives are rejected where as type i errors cause problems when even one drug is allowed if you kick out regulation youll move from type ii errors to type i thats not really an improvement
technology,not_removed,here is a video demonstration of an alternative to the epipen how is this harder than the epipen
technology,not_removed,right their reputation will be in tatters and theyll never have to work again
technology,not_removed,oh no trump is going to end the world and i am not even being remotely unreasonable with my doomsday fearing rabble clintonites when trying to get people to vote for clinton
technology,not_removed,they need to be at least three times as big
technology,not_removed,they work well with piano playing seagulls obscure flight of the concords shout out
technology,not_removed,hey fuck your mother whore dont question how i run my country ill take my friendship bracelets to russia and china then well see whos laughing
technology,not_removed,i think aadee doesnt go too far enough
technology,not_removed,independent pharmacies are a nearmythical thing that barely exists anymore source chain retail pharmd wage slave wishing there was something better
technology,not_removed,actually people from mylan lobbied the fda to make that change its worse than you think
technology,not_removed,its actually an important point if the other injectors arent safe then that explains why the government would prohibit them from being sold
technology,not_removed,ah i thought that may be the case but since the the epinephrine is well known and it is being injected im i didnt know if it might be a special case where the drug wasnt considered i mean we arent talking about drug elution from a novel material where elution speed and interaction is in question
technology,not_removed,yeah there is a lot of misinformation in this thread the best part is the mylan doesnt even own the patents for epipen pfizer does through its subsidiaries king pharmaceuticals which owns meridian medical technologies which is the listed patent owner mylan only has marketing and distribution rights
technology,not_removed,consumers who survived would always ask questions or go elsewhere consumers who buy things without asking questions well ya know
technology,not_removed,but getting new drugs a year earlier and at half the price would also save people you have to balance drug safety with availability and many think that the current system puts too much weight on the safety side then there is the fact that anything dealing with government bureaucracy is slow and expensive
technology,not_removed,for medicine type i errors are way worse than type ii errors not really how many people died in the worst incident you can think of where a drug was approved when it shouldnt have been the numbers are typically in the hundreds on the other hand as recently as the fda delayed a cancer treatment drug with an estimated effect of killing people there are so many safe ways that the fda could make drug approval easier without making it more dangerous but they do none of it they could start with reciprocal drug approval with europe and other first world nations
technology,not_removed,so its just like the atropinepralodoxime chloride injectors in nerve agent antidote kits that shit is super easy
technology,not_removed,it looks harder to use to me epipen pull off cap stab self adrenaclick pull off cap pull off other cap stab self press button neither are exactly complicated but the epipen looks simpler to me
technology,not_removed,this should be the top post and its why this whole thing is so ridiculous epipen is popular because it is the easiest to use and mainly because they spent a ton on marketing the whole argument about having to get a new prescription is dumb too ive gotten vicodin and xanax prescribed to me by calling my doctor on the phone since doctors know the price of epipens went up i imagine thats all it would take for most people to be able to get adrenaclick
technology,not_removed,hasnt been failuretested as extensively as epipen in order for these to be approved by the fda they have to be reliable
technology,not_removed,its gotten to the point that when i see the fear mongering in these posts i stop reading and move on out of all of the hillaristas ive run into in the last month or two ive had positivenonfearbased interactions with maybe of them the best was when i called one of them out for lack of substance and fear mongering and their response was just more fear mongering
technology,not_removed,the xylophone just got teeth taller
technology,not_removed,okay well take the middle ground xylophones for mice
technology,not_removed,i read that as adele doesnt go far enough
technology,not_removed,thats awful philadelphia has a few of us around were almost entirely niche based meaning ltc compounding hiv focused etc pure retail can succeed but its way harder
technology,not_removed,then people shouldnt complain when the government actively stifles competition and the price goes through the roof
technology,not_removed,with an estimated effect of killing people not accurate lost life years not lost lives your question does not make sense fdas task involves blocking drugs right now there are very few type i errors because thats the type of error fda prevents when the fda would stop preventing those wed see an increase of type i errors and a decrease of type ii errors all else being equal i prefer type ii errors as in many cases alternatives are available for the record i dont argue that the fda is good the way it is i cant see that from this side of the ocean im arguing against those stating it should not exist or have no significant role approving drugs is a hard and costly business doing it right involves audits drug trials research and much more cooperation with other regulators such as the european ones you suggest would definitely be a good thing
technology,not_removed,they are approved by the fda i mean these are already prescribable they just wont let them prescribe them if the scrip is for an epipen because they think people could get confused if theyre used to using one and then get the other
technology,not_removed,give a mouse an instrument
technology,not_removed,giving them expanded powers hasnt helped much even prior to them having their current day powers the worst type i incident killed people which is still possibly an order of magnitude less than the lives lost during the delay i posted about above and companies have an existing reason to avoid type i errors we have a tort system in the united states that is designed for these kinds of problems no one has an incentive to lessen type ii errors in the current system the fda would get in more trouble from congress if they let a drug through that kills one person than all the trouble they got in for losing life years for the record i dont argue that the fda is good the way it is i cant see that from this side of the ocean im arguing against those stating it should not exist or have no significant role approving drugs is a hard and costly business doing it right involves audits drug trials research and much more cooperation with other regulators such as the european ones you suggest would definitely be a good thing ill just say that regulations tend to have secondary unintended consequences there is no such thing as a free lunch in this world whether type i medical error or type ii medical errors are worse is actually an empirically testable fact and we can know the current levels of that tradeoff none of these things are easy and we should not blindly trust government regulators to get that tradeoff correct just like we dont blindly trust private companies to get that tradeoff correct and insisting without evidence that one type of error that kills people is always worse than another type of error that kills people is the kind of blind trust that makes these systems worse not better
technology,not_removed,er hmm maybe im thinking of a different product i stand corrected
technology,not_removed,everyone needs to be on board for this upcoming attack on net neutrality
technology,not_removed,thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed for the following reasons rule this submission violates the sidebar guidelines in being not primarily news or developments in technology not within the context of technology if a self post not a positive contribution fostering reasonable discussion if you have any questions please and include the link to the submission we apologize for the inconvenience
technology,not_removed,updating the drivers for my graphics card through after driver update system might checked other drivers statuses causing usb ports to turn off and on does your camera act the same way when you connect it
technology,not_removed,you may have been hit by a driveby worm or something from the nsa or other groups web cam access is actually pretty damn easy for any group with decent resources especially through consumer routers and on windows machines most people just put some tape over their webcams but they can also activate your mic i personally dont care if my laptop gets compromised because i never do anything on it or in front of that could be used against me but a lot of people are paranoid and will even physically unplug their laptops mic and camera
technology,not_removed,what os what hardware what webcam are you fully patched if it was a hack it wasnt great webcam leds are often software controlled meaning the camera can be turned on without the led coming on some hardware provides physical switches for cam mic etc eg purism
technology,not_removed,how likely is this though i know its a possibility but is it reasonable for me to assume that it can be nothing other than a hacker trying to watch me
technology,not_removed,yeah it could be but it seems very unlikely
technology,not_removed,do you have antivirus firewall or any program that watches and kills suspicious processes if not than it could be a chance or more that your network was randomly breeched and your laptop compromised even if only as an exploratory hack in reality its more like a chance that is what occurred and some other process probably something stupid on windows that caused it to turn on
technology,not_removed,i have microsoft security essentials but thats it i ran a full virus scan immediately after this happened and nothing showed up
technology,not_removed,i would keep an eye on it and see if it happens again msse will not catch something like this if it is coming from a competent group like the nsa but most likely something else in windows triggered it if it had been an attempt from the nsa or other big group they should have disabled the led so it was probably windows if you notice it coming on randomly i would considered wiping the machine and doing a fresh install
technology,not_removed,thanks a lot for the help
technology,not_removed,i agree with bob its extremely unlikely it was hacked probably just windows acting up
technology,not_removed,by no means am i suggesting an endorsement of hillary clinton rather im posting this article because ive heard no other presidential candidate discuss some of the various points of her plan
technology,not_removed,are you kidding me she had her own server in her house s yeah im not sure what trump could talk about regarding tech other than it would be the greatest because he knows all about greatness and people think he is great therefore his tech plan is great lol
technology,not_removed,ive only posted it twice need help counting on rapple and rtech because i believe it would interest those subs most enjoy
technology,not_removed,i dont need help counting thanks oh but you do obviously i posted the appleinsider link in rtechnology right because apple fans frequent this sub i posted the appleinsider link in rapple right because this is an article from an apple site and i thought they would enjoy my other posts in rprivacy rpolitics and rtechnology are not the same appleinsider link as you incoherently pointed out the other posts were of hillary clintons website so people could read more in depth i thought rtechnology would enjoy seeing the more specific article from her website i also thought rpolitics would enjoy seeing more the specific article from her website and lastly i thought rprivacy would enjoy tearing up some of hillarys dubious points as i did in my post see appleinsider articles not official hillary clinton articles not now i will give you kudos for counting edit link
technology,not_removed,some information why it should not gain traction not my blog tldr no one is allowed to save the adress database the adresses belong to the company and you need to use their api to get adresses the algorithm is patented you cant reimplement it for something like offline smartphone apps to look up adresses edit see below seems like you can do that now how is this supposed to work in developing countries when the company shuts down the countries adresses are lost from one day to another when someone is sitting in an area with no internet or the company is having technical problems they cant use the api to look up adresses
technology,not_removed,yankedhotelfoxtrot
technology,not_removed,this is absolutely incredible i hope it gains real traction its like a human global positioning system if i directed you to the address of my workplace thats a huge site but if i told you to come to monkeypuzzleclub not my real address im pretty sure you could precisely find me if you cant locate something within a square youve probably got bigger problems it seems like it would be an instantly better addressing system for almost anything humanrelated
technology,not_removed,and yet here is information about how to use the data offline and some further reading we understand that organisations who integrate need assurances about the longterm viability of the technology if we ltd are ever unable to maintain the technology or make arrangements for it to be maintained by a thirdparty with that thirdparty being willing to make this same commitment then we will release our source code into the public domain we will do this in such a way and with suitable licences and documentation to ensure that any and all users of whether they are individuals businesses charitable organisations aid agencies governments or anyone else can continue to rely on the system edit and a bit more info for building your own offline app
technology,not_removed,yeah that part of it is pretty damn cool all you need is those three words and you can find anybody
technology,not_removed,two quick and easy examples calling the police help im at stophammeritem i just saw someone get shot and in the printed lonely planet guide when youre traveling through goa come visit our amazing cafe at fabricrefunddiagnose
technology,not_removed,how is this better than gps coordinates if you dont like that why not us mgrs httpsenwikipediaorgwikimilitarygridreferencesystem if you have the ability to see which square you are in then you have the ability to write down your gps coordinates since the square is derived from gps just give people your gps coordinates it mentions that because of gps location error it might be possible that youre showing up in the wrong square and that when you tell people where you are you should use their map to figure out which square is correct not the square that is reported from your device if thats the case why not just right click on a googlemap and get the coordinate that way think it over itll come to you hint mnemonic
technology,not_removed,theres literally nothing there thats the eastern russian wasteland
technology,not_removed,its proprietary bullshit id wait until some proper open source software that works offline comes out for the same task its got one of those bullshit software patents that should have never existed copyright is enough for software patents arent needed
technology,not_removed,it does work offline so you can develop your own app as a counter argument they need to retain control to ensure that multiple and incompatible dictionaries dont crop up their spells it out in what i think is a very fair manner we understand that organisations who integrate need assurances about the longterm viability of the technology our goal is for to become a global standard for communicating location at the moment the core algorithms and data are not in the public domain in the future we may release some or all of our source code – we will continually evaluate the business case for doing this in the meantime we commit to the following if we ltd are ever unable to maintain the technology or make arrangements for it to be maintained by a thirdparty with that thirdparty being willing to make this same commitment then we will release our source code into the public domain we will do this in such a way and with suitable licences and documentation to ensure that any and all users of whether they are individuals businesses charitable organisations aid agencies governments or anyone else can continue to rely on the system
technology,not_removed,just send the coordinates modern devices can copypaste why would you need to memorize it maybe for the plus of the world that doesnt have access to modern devices maybe coordinates need to be relayed by radio due to a communications situationlook youre not going to argue that easiertoremember is worse than hardtoremember even if you can prove we dont need to remember things that often
technology,not_removed,maybe for the plus of the world that doesnt have access to modern devices so you understand the problem but dont understand the underlying problem this whole website is designed to work on technology for people who dont have technology
technology,not_removed,what good is a gps pseudonym without a gps what good are coordinates wout a gps
technology,not_removed,so you understand the problem but dont understand the underlying problem this whole website is designed to work on technology for people who dont have technology they dont need to use the website they just need to use the words that are given them to them by somebody who does this would be easier to remember and communicate than gps coordinates
technology,not_removed,if they dont use the website how are they getting the words if their country and community is so poor who is using the tech to look up what words equal what since the words dont have a logical pattern they dont help someone who doesnt have the map
technology,not_removed,if you need to describe your location and you dont have access to a gps or computer how are you going to know your location in the first place we just got down talking about memorization and mnemonics
technology,not_removed,if they dont use the website how are they getting the words gubmint or ngos if their country and community is so poor who is using the tech to look up what words equal what gubmnet and ngos
technology,not_removed,its already huge in mongolia
technology,not_removed,beep boop i have reduced this to of the original words less photo daniel lealolivas afpgetty images san francisco the european union ruling that apple must pay billion in what it says are unpaid back taxes could be just the start of protracted tax battles between the eu and multinationals say tax experts tech heavyweights google microsoft and facebook all of whom enjoy highly favorable tax deals in ireland luxembourg and elsewhere are absolutely on the radar of the eu says brad badertscher professor of accountancy in the university of notre dames mendoza college of business the eu set off on its threeyear probe of tax practices because it says tax deals like the one apple experienced in ireland put other companies at an unfair disadvantage harming eu taxpayers and violating the economic unions rules on state aid ireland has disputed the eus findings and says it hasnt done tax deals top key phrases brad badertscher tech heavyweights google tax experts eu taxpayers tax deals
technology,not_removed,our long national nightmare will soon be over
technology,not_removed,in my opinion it is more of a downgrade
technology,not_removed,probably because it is
technology,not_removed,ah why is it called artificial intelligence if it cant learn
technology,not_removed,the article in full there are many companies working on artificial intelligence the vast majority of these are looking at how artificial intelligence systems can recognize things and tell them apart – differentiate between an apple and a mango for example but what do these artificial intelligence systems do with that information once theyve perfected a method of gathering and defining it this is where decision trees come in decision trees are used to map various consequences and possible actions an artificial intelligence system can take for example in an autonomous driving system if sensors were to recognise an object in the road ahead a decision tree could include options such as slow down emergency stop or swerve one of these would then be chosen based on the information gathered and the perceived outcomes and while many companies are looking at the best ways to gather that kind of information noone else – as far as can be determined – is currently looking at ways to instil machine learning and automation into the decision making process through the introduction of machine learning algorithms prowlerio a new uk startup launched earlier this year believes it is the first to do so the company recently closed a £ million seed funding round supported by noted tech venture capitalists such as amadeus capital prowlerio will use that money to develop a platform that can improve artificial intelligence decisionmaking systems if successful it could develop a solution worth billions to the tech industry currently companies in all areas linked to decision marking spend £ £ billion creating decisions trees says vishal chatrath cofounder and chief executive officer ceo of prowlerio simplifying the process even by could save billions he adds the startup is initially planning to work in the area of game development but chatrath sees the base platform as something that could easily be used by a wide variety of sectors prowlerio is already working with three partners on an early stage proof of concept he expects it to be ready by march a decision tree in any vertical can be replaced by our technology he says anything that comes down to a fundamental decision making problem we see near limitless use cases for nextgeneration machine and reinforcement learning to revolutionise industries says eileen burbidge partner at passion capital one of the venture capital firms investing in prowlerio from smart city infrastructure to agriculture to drones in the very near future powerful artificial intelligence is going to change the world we live in for the better
technology,not_removed,fair enough suppose it could be designed in such a way that it would a be useful reusable for the consumer andor b at the very least be recyclable which of course all productspackaging should be
technology,not_removed,waiting to hear they both committed suicide by shooting themselves in the head twice oily footprints left at the scene
technology,not_removed,so how efficient is it in actual terms
technology,not_removed,i swear i read about this same thing in japan like years ago however the catalyst was difficult to make
technology,not_removed,im sure there will still be some reason we need a carbon tax
technology,not_removed,ive read this article and few others but i dont completely understand wouldnt the by product or pollution from these fuels made from just be more how is that effective just recycling pollution into more pollution to keep it at the level its already at can someone explain this to me
technology,not_removed,imagine if in years we can reprocess a substantial portion of the we produce it really could be a new day dawning for renewables and atmospheric preservation for our planet big question though is tungsten rare
technology,not_removed,very interesting stuff but im not sure i understand what happens to the co in the other side of the equation what happens to it again does it get embedded into the diesel by product otherwisenifty
technology,not_removed,those who sell oil will have something to say about that
technology,not_removed,quite if of the reddit karmabait articles about this kinda shit were real wed have solved global warming and all our energy problems decades ago
technology,not_removed,it would be carbon neutral you wouldnt be having to pull oil from the ground to burn youd pull from the air and burn it back into the air
technology,not_removed,tungsten isnt that rare bucks a kilo is cheap co co can further be processed into methane or methanol both of which are very useful as fuels the main thing to remember is that its a closed cycle at best and this is still a pretty huge benefit it would mean not making our atmospheric problems any worse a long term fix would still be to sequester back into the ground natures way is to bury plant matter permanently eg peat bog without letting it decompose
technology,not_removed,not that rare but were using more and more of it so its growing demand and you still have the china problem there are deposits of it around the world but china has large deposits so if they decide to choke or open the market it makes it volatile for companies to invest in current mines in peru and canada
technology,not_removed,if theyre smart theyll invest heavily in this technology and the machinery it would help divorce themselves oil while still having a product they can sell using existing infrastructure
technology,not_removed,so basically recycling the carbon and never really reducing the amount just not adding anymore
technology,not_removed,china has tungsten sounds like they need some freedom meme of the future
technology,not_removed,i wonder if consumption is on the decline i dont know what else its used for but it was used to make light bulb filaments
technology,not_removed,you are much less cynical than me my friend its easier and cheaper to block any tech that endangers fossil fuels
technology,not_removed,its not its actually heavily on the rise with the price increasing a year its properties make it one of the densest metals we have with a melting point of °c it is the most heat resistant metal available as for its uses its used in construction high end tools bullets missiles rocket engines welding used heavily in electronics heating elements etc
technology,not_removed,such qualities making it suitable for filaments i guess til
technology,not_removed,thatis a very shadowruny law
technology,not_removed,so wait stereotypes have a basis in reality and big data is important because its a magic machine which enables you to do what youve always done dont get me wrong but the idea that this data is racist because it makes african americans look bad is insane the collective can be as awful as it likes if white people were literally just man eating oppressors fresh out the caves with the blood fo innocent childrenanimals stuck to their nether regions collectively well cassandra from apartment c could still be a nice woman who never hurt a soul its essentailly if a human does it its racist and so we make a machine do it which judges collectives and applies it to the individual which is far worse than someone who merely hates most black people
technology,not_removed,internet of things
technology,not_removed,lookout chaturbate here i cum wait
technology,not_removed,is it legal
technology,not_removed,why does this remind me of the movie storks
technology,not_removed,get smooth solution with facebook password recovery is very helpful for me as it involve the best technicians team to deal with the outstanding support
technology,not_removed,considering the prevalence of the trump murals appearance often uncensored around pretty much every corner of instagram this actually does seem rather biased
technology,not_removed,i dont support donald trump but i cant call him a fascist and then censor his supporters that makes me the fascist to paraphrase the famous quote i may not agree with your stripper hillary clinton mural but ill defend to the death your right to post it on instagram
technology,not_removed,those you arent allowed to ridicule are your true masters
technology,not_removed,itt people complaining yet again about things they know nothing about this shit happens all the time for this reason or that due to people abusing the report feature his account is active again btw
technology,not_removed,ffs this is just getting disgusting now
technology,not_removed,it can be anyone who reports abuse on that user its not some vast conspiracy to stifle free speech
technology,not_removed,here is his
technology,not_removed,go against the party and you will find yourself a nonperson
technology,not_removed,does hillary just have the entirety of the internet in her pocket or something seems like every day theres a different platform censoring antihillary or protrump stuff
technology,not_removed,come on people what do you think america is a country that actually values freedom of speech
technology,not_removed,please people just abused the report feature and his account was temporarily banned its back this happens all the time because these big sites dont have a sane oversight of the report feature

technology,not_removed,can someone link me with the trump art he mentioned doing previously
technology,not_removed,from the images included in the artice it doesnt seem like the hillary and trump murals are very similar it sounds a lot morecently like his most recent one just caught the eyes of the instagram no sexual imagry police and got his account banned
technology,not_removed,instagram myspace facebookthese are all run by outspoken dnc supporters are you really surprised that theyre not platforms of free speech if someone came into your home and started insulting your parents furniture and beliefs you would probably kick them out
technology,not_removed,can i at least mention hes not a very good artist also who isnt aware that facebook owner of instagram is a leftist company theyve banned posts critical of jihadism for offending some muslims its a private company they can do what they like in this regard if that fool wants to join a rightist social media company he is free to do so in the meantime hes just getting publicity for crummy art with a crummy message
technology,not_removed,twitter is for profit so you cant do whatever you want there is no free speech here you are lucky your isp is still connecting you at your house in the us hrc could pay fios to cancel you without reason and refuse service
technology,not_removed,why the fuck does a person from melbourne care enough about the american presidential race to paint that awful thing on an australian street
technology,not_removed,just wait for john olivers famous double standard he loooooves the nude paintings of trump with his micropenis i wonder if this gets even a passing mention
technology,not_removed,guys this was on the front page but they removed it minutes ago
technology,not_removed,its not fascism when they do it
technology,not_removed,is trumps package hanging out in those murals sorta thats the real problem not politics
technology,not_removed,this story is bullshit
technology,not_removed,you have no first amendment right on instagram or with any other nongovernment actor or agent of the government if were gonna get specific nowif someone in the executive branch is directing viewpoint suppression we may be onto something
technology,not_removed,how do you feel about instagrams right to conduct business as they see fit
technology,not_removed,you can call him a fascist all you want edit the downvotes are confusing me
technology,not_removed,mechastriesand banished to a remote atoll stirs upon the sensing of a foe trying to rid the internet of content mecha striesand wades into the surf and instinctively heads toward attempts to tame the wilds of the internet the internet shows us again and again that wishing content away is the folly of men godzillamecha striesand
technology,not_removed,my true masters are children with terminal illnesses
technology,not_removed,can you link i dont know instagram
technology,not_removed,nope its back but flagged as private httpswwwinstagramcomlushsuxhlen
technology,not_removed,its the dirty tricks the elite play like this and the snobbish liberals in these trendy social media platforms that force even the most rational of voters to go out and vote against this dishonest manipulation the brexit campaign in britain was horrendous the names that remain voters called leave voters was uncalled for disrespectful and this was done in the absence of a positive message for their cause the strategy of attacking your political opponents is a losing strategy if you cant fight a fair fight for your cause then youre going to lose thats what modern times are all about if youre going to censor the majority opinion the majority will vote to punish you
technology,not_removed,but no trump supporters had flagged any of the trump images because they believe in free speech either instagram deleted it or the trump ones were flagged as well but still decided they could stay its not really a conspiracy instagram is owned by facebook and theyve shown who they support but now we also see how they are choosing to show that support
technology,not_removed,ah but being reasonable would compromise the sanders echo chamber that is reddit
technology,not_removed,what does that mean since when was instagram a private company the arbiter of personhood
technology,not_removed,facebook supports her facebook owns instagramso maybe
technology,not_removed,google and facebook are only two companies and they influence a huge part of what consider to be the internet two companies two executive teams not that hard to get in your pocket
technology,not_removed,i think you mean australia
technology,not_removed,what are you talking about are we talking the story or are you now talking politics since it was mentioned
technology,not_removed,have you seen some of the trump murals on instagram not just the ones posted in this article
technology,not_removed,seriously youre saying it violated the no sexy imagery clause but all of these are ok seems like it might be something else httpswwwinstagramcomexploretagssex
technology,not_removed,it violated rtechnology s rules of course it was removed its not a fucking conspiracy
technology,not_removed,twitter and instagram are different companies
technology,not_removed,that sums up her oppositions intellect
technology,not_removed,us policy greatly affects australia they end up supporting all of the us wars and military action for example australia has soldiers in afghanistan
technology,not_removed,its oliver jon s and colbert never fully challenged the establishment left in the same way the media draws a line as to what is acceptable liberalism
technology,not_removed,fuck john oliver
technology,not_removed,they removed it because the article violated the subreddits rules
technology,not_removed,i mean you do you cant be prosecuted and jailed for posting pictures with obvious exceptions but instagram also has the right to do whatever they feel necessary all of which im sure is covered in the terms agreements you agree to while using the website
technology,not_removed,no shit but thats not the damn point
technology,not_removed,i mean fair point they have as much a right to delete a users account as the user has to post a picture of a mural and they may suffer for it if it gets over publicized and conservatives by that i mean trump supporters which isnt always the same thing these days decide to abandon instagram however id point out that it becomes more and more unsettling with each passing year how much power social media has over free expression again i dont like that mural but just because i dont like something doesnt mean it shouldnt be communicated what if instagram was pronazi in the and it turned out that in fact hillary was the fascist and ol donny t was in fact the great white hope itd be a shame if a few executives and publicists who were on the wrong side of history had the power to influence the collective consciencewhich has definitely happened in the past and will more than likely happen again
technology,not_removed,by that logic can bakers deny service to gay couples
technology,not_removed,i think this shows that regulation is needed much like other forms of communications technology are regulated imagine if the phone company would just bleep out certain conversations they didnt agree with would you be ok with that because verizon is a private company free to conduct its business
technology,not_removed,i totaly defend that but social media centers are all located in very liberal areas sf palo alto ect most of the workers are pretty liberal you kind of have to be a closeted conservative in the bay area i dont mind bias everyone has it but admit it just like reddit admitted it bias toward trump they completely got rid of a subs ability to dominate the front page not a problem for bernies sub to do it but trumps sub fuck that
technology,not_removed,can and should are different things
technology,not_removed,a christian baker wasnt allowed to
technology,not_removed,not if he wins he wants to be able to sue media outlets that criticize him
technology,not_removed,yes but at least they wont be your masters for long
technology,not_removed,and gay babies never forget the gay babies
technology,not_removed,httpswwwinstagramcomlushsuxhlen it happens to artists all the time usually for nudity but no not on reddit everything that involves clinton is a god damn conspiracy
technology,not_removed,httpswwwinstagramcomlushsuxhlen is the instagram page its private though
technology,not_removed,and i would assume he set it to private himself helps keep from being shut down in the future when posting stuff that ruffles peoples feathers
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,i lived in te uk during brexit and while i wish your point was true its just not a good example the entire campaign from both sides had almost nothing to do with facts and real effects it was all rhetoric and insults from both sides it was just like any election in the modern west neither side actually cared about facts and thus neither did the voters it all just panders to emotions there are a lot of reasons that leave won but their opponents being dicks is most definitely not a major one
technology,not_removed,absence of a positive message for their cause you mean like how clinton has almost nothing to say about why you should vote for her only why you shouldnt vote for trump
technology,not_removed,it also helps that you probably never look at right wing media right wing forums if youre constantly on left wing reddit of course youre going to see more mud slinging from the left
technology,not_removed,exactly if anything the brexit vote demonstrated that people are waking up to this nonsense
technology,not_removed,maybe the account got flagged so many times from all the different pictures that instagram just ended up deleting it automatically
technology,not_removed,well some of us are aware that correct the record exists
technology,not_removed,i believe it was a reference to
technology,not_removed,not so sure facebook supports hillary her accepting and getting the nomination hasnt been in their trending news at all which we now know is human curated
technology,not_removed,but i think instagram is an american company however i might be mistaken there
technology,not_removed,american company censoring his account though
technology,not_removed,i find nothing sexy about that mural
technology,not_removed,youve offered nothing but to say i have low intelligence we can disagree but i wont assume anything about you other than that your sense of humor is a bit stale
technology,not_removed,sorry i misread and was confused im old
technology,not_removed,have you been watching colbert lately he is definitely open showing his distaste for hillary being the nominee
technology,not_removed,i am a biased j stewart fan boy so take what i say with a grain of salt but i felt jon actually kept himself and his viewers informed he would at least lay out his reasoning for his position with cititations and quotes so you could see where he was coming from also trump was nothing more than a distant bad dream when he still hosted the daily show colbert was less serious and more of a very entertaining character seeing him on his current show just confirmed for me he is a great actor but not so much a critic
technology,not_removed,im a bit out of the loop why do we not like john oliver anymore
technology,not_removed,youre right but some people have a misunderstanding instagram is a private company the first amendment prevents government suppression of speech amongst other things instagram is not a government agency you can say whatever you want without fear of government intervention but you have no argument against instagram arbitrarily deleting your content
technology,not_removed,then what is that we should nationalize certain pervasive social media networks
technology,not_removed,or just admit that they are on the democratic teet and have zero shame in admitting that oh side note dnc picks who ever they want dem voters have to deal with it gop admits they screwed up and gave trump too much room to work
technology,not_removed,if i can try no they cant refuse to serve the couple but they can refuse to make the cake in the shape of two dicks kissing it seems the difference is instagram will let anyone have an account but they decide what gets taken down
technology,not_removed,i think these people who are censoring dont realize that doing so only furthers the narrative that the establishment doesnt want trump fb and google both are in bed with dc democrats and when people see that it makes the electorate angrier than they already are
technology,not_removed,look what happened to the inventor of javascript for just one example of proof
technology,not_removed,thank you
technology,not_removed,thanks
technology,not_removed,im just glad i dont live in the us i dont get to hassle with shitty isps and shitty politicians i mean our politicians are also shitty but they are peanuts compared to the american shit show going on right now
technology,not_removed,runitedkingdom was full of labels and insults like racist stupid xenophobe and bans if you voiced support for leave you were banned from the subreddit ordinary people are sick of that namecalling bullshit from elitist types and it shows at the polling booth for some reason the left continue to indulge in hatelabelling their opposition its a proven losing strategy but they keep trying like fools
technology,not_removed,i argued with someone on reddit about brexit they gave a couple points that they said they werent sure if were actually true about the outcome but ended their argument literally saying that if millenials academics economists and london were against leaving then he had to vote to leave because he hates them im not kidding that was literally his main argument
technology,not_removed,right trump goes on and on about what hes gonna do it pisses off those who dont like his plans but he puts his cards on the table hilary err apart from slogans and claiming she broke a glass ceiling that her husband led her through i mean cmon an independent woman making it on her own thats to celebrate but being dragged by the hand there by your husband thats not woman power its actually derogatory to women
technology,not_removed,you might have a point if i was innundated with right wing bullshit i might vote against them
technology,not_removed,considering lush is really ah how do i say this abrasive i mean the guy quite regularly sprays cunt on buildings im not surprised his account been marked as a possible problem by an american owned company
technology,not_removed,but with the millions of people on instagram you dont think there would also be a high number of trump supporters flagging the trump pictures why didnt those get automatically deleted
technology,not_removed,and some of you assume that every single hillary supporter is a paid shill listen we all have opinions and thats a good thing its a really important thing but dont act for a second like reddit has an even remotely unbiased or objective view of hrc
technology,not_removed,a wrongly interpreted quote from to support a hyperbolic point on reddit well i never
technology,not_removed,its actually a reference to the communist chinese practice of the state denying you normal rights of citizenship a nonperson cannot enter public schools or university cannot stay at a hotel cannot open a bank account cannot marry or legally hold a job they are also denied travel
technology,not_removed,thats the thing were talking about private company choosing who to do business with but this person pulled out a totalitarian government comparison im reminded of high school debate wed just accuse the opponent of totalitarianism rather than thinking seriously
technology,not_removed,yeah youre right i wasnt thinking about instagram
technology,not_removed,have you heard of donald trump if you havent seen the subreddit his fans have created that may also be instructive it looks practically identical to satire calling him literally god emperor daddy
technology,not_removed,hes always been openly showing his distaste for her he shits on her in the beginning of his show whenever they go over politics he was especially brutal with his coverage of the dnc edit dnc piece i mentioned hilarious and brutal all at once eat my butt bonus hungry for power games
technology,not_removed,why arent colbert and the likes shinning a light on the actual left the us clearly is not being represented by its two party system there is an actual popular progressive left that gets zero attention from these guys i find that interesting
technology,not_removed,why arent colbert and the likes shinning a light on the actual left the us clearly is not being represented by its two party system there is an actual popular progressive left that gets zero attention from these guys i find that interesting
technology,not_removed,you are absolutely right honestly john olivers shoe on hbo is better than the daily show was simply because it can be
technology,not_removed,colbert can give just as good arguments as stewart he just doesnt take it anywhere near as seriously
technology,not_removed,trust me the comedy circuit loved to pull the we arent really news excuse whenever they got accused of editorializing that made fox news seem like it was living up to its slogan you can read about a couple of people who were straight up lied to about the interview process in order to get them to look stupid on air
technology,not_removed,im with you there total fan boy of these guys and their writing staff and producers the us has a very interesting establishment left that is actually considerably right of where its citizens are this has been observed academically for decades statistically people register differently than the way congress votes and the two platforms tldr the producers of these comedy shows are right of centre
technology,not_removed,seems like every episode is about trump lately ive yet to hear a word about hillary from the guy
technology,not_removed,he always go for the low hanging fruit in terms of political humor and wont do anything that isnt absolutely safe i dont think hes bad overall i like him but i dont watch the show anymore i dont need to watch a show to understand that trump probably wont be a good president and racism is wrong so if that is all youre going to talk about im not going to watch your show he should be using this platform to draw attention to issues that need it like for example hillarys poor record on honesty and how all evidence indicates she plans to go back on several of her campaign promises or her msm collusion
technology,not_removed,i thought he was a great correspondent for the daily show but his character gets stretched very thin when its hour of him
technology,not_removed,who doesnt love john oliver hes hilarious and on point most of the time
technology,not_removed,fundamentally misunderstands the federalist system
technology,not_removed,people still like him rtd just showed up to the thread
technology,not_removed,because we are cool and alternative we only like things that only some people like when that group of people gets too big then that thing suuucks and we bow out like gentlemen to the next thing some people like i hope this makes sense as i have other matters to attend to mom where are the pizza pockets i asked for
technology,not_removed,ive never liked the guy its intellectually dishonest to present your oppositions case satirically when you know youre being treated as a source of information as a comedian hes not my style but i respect his talent as a news and information source hes unbelievably biased same goes for every satirical almost news show if people treated it like comedy fine but i hear people saying comedians are the only news source i trust these days way too much for my liking and far far too much for it to be accidental on the comedians part
technology,not_removed,because he makes fun of the things reddit loves like racism sexism and being middle class middlebrow white dudes
technology,not_removed,im pretty sure it started when he did a show vaguely sympathetic to a feminist topic and we all know how much reddit hates that edit the expected downvotes are really only proving my point people
technology,not_removed,here are the guidelines submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology self posts must contribute positively to rtechnology and foster reasonable discussion submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world this post really doesnt do any of those things also look at the ops post history and tell me that he doesnt have an agenda
technology,not_removed,not defending the dems but the gop has been screwing up for almost two solid decades at this point
technology,not_removed,hillary won the fucking primary sure there was some sketchy stuff but not enough that without it she wouldnt have won america is still too backwards for bernie most older democrats voted for hillary and more of them vote than of younger people just because you disagree with their choice doesnt mean that their votes shouldnt count for the record i was a huge bernie supporter and now i support hillary since i expect her to preserve the status quo which while bad isnt as bad as trump actively working to enact changes that will destroy livelyhoods hurt diplomatic relations and attack millions of innocent muslims hispanics and immigrants
technology,not_removed,no they terminated the account refusing support because of artistic expression
technology,not_removed,spot on by censoring theyre bringing the streisand effect into play
technology,not_removed,then butter my butt and call me a biscuit because i actually agree with the establishment on something then
technology,not_removed,he used the term lie in reference to things that are true but make him look bad
technology,not_removed,ordinary people are sick of that namecalling bullshit from elitist types but they keep trying like fools dude you cant even avoid calling them elitists and fools in the very comment about how terrible the left are for insulting their opponents
technology,not_removed,i was there bruh i saw that just as much as i saw lazy millenials filthy immigrants european overlords unpatriotic idiotic and naive its politics this is sadly what politics is nowadays im not denying that leave said stupid things but to claim that they were the only ones flinging shit is ridiculous so little real discussion was had that i know a significant amount of people on both sides who hardly even knew what the vote was really about runitedkingdom is on reddit meaning that it skews heavily towards the young of course youre going to see more leave shitslinging there that demographic voted overwhelmingly in favor of staying
technology,not_removed,that subreddit does not represent the entirety of the uk either
technology,not_removed,well most leave voters were old racists so i cant really blame the mods for that
technology,not_removed,about what hes gonna do i mean if you consider i have the best ideas the best plans im going to do all the good things and take away all the bad things and make them better putting his cards on the table the mans straightup refused to give solid information of his plans until hes elected because he wants to keep them secret
technology,not_removed,trump goes on and on about what hes gonna do it pisses off those who dont like his plans but he puts his cards on the table has he explained how he is going to pay for the wall and deport million illegal immigrants i bet he has mentioned doing it but not mentioned how
technology,not_removed,trump goes on and on about what hes gonna do it pisses off those who dont like his plans but he puts his cards on the table of the plans he lays out is actually just meaningless bluster another is pure garbage the last is everything else hilary err apart from slogans has years in the senate and pretty detailed plans on most of her issues and claiming she broke a glass ceiling that her husband led her through i mean cmon an independent woman making it on her own thats to celebrate but being dragged by the hand there by your husband thats not woman power its actually derogatory to women theres a pretty good chance shed have been the democratic nominee even if her husband was a nobody shes been climbing the political ladder from the age of to the goal of president she has put forth a very large amount of effort to do things on her own outside of bills shadow back before bill ran for president he ran on the slogan of two for one remember edit not that i endorse criminal clinton
technology,not_removed,i dont know anything about instagrams algorithms but perhaps there was some kind of threshold of total complaints against the account as in not just complaints against a single picture alone or a combination of all the complaints against every picture that were accumulated that resulted in an automatic ban
technology,not_removed,sorry my english is fluent im not one for insults that can throw some people off on reddit i dont have a translator handy what part of my two sentences didnt you understand i will gladly explain
technology,not_removed,even the recent episode with the werd he all but said i dont like her but shes better than trump i think he literally said you need to vote and you might have to vote for someone you dont like but its better than someone you really dont like with the lesser of two evils written hes not hiding his feelings at all
technology,not_removed,just when i though i couldnt love colbert more
technology,not_removed,agreed he just blatantly says that trump is far worse would he prefer a different nominee yeah but we cant do anything now
technology,not_removed,they dont want actual progress theyre part of the media and the media is owned by big money they want things to stay the same they want hillary
technology,not_removed,like bernie who colbert has had on his show multiple times and has openly supported this entire election do you watch the show or are you saying theres an even further left
technology,not_removed,im less a fan of his hbo show but i have to admit the guy does have nice shoes
technology,not_removed,watch the latest one but trump does deserve a bit more credit on account of the fact that he is a pro torturefacist
technology,not_removed,plus he openly lies like the recent shit about music licensing as if the venue did not pay bmiascap if you make a living on tv you know how that shit works edit wow reddit double digit negatives for pointing out that oliver blatantly lied that bmiascap fees werent being paid for the use of songs at the rnc etc this topic comes up every election cycle if the bmiascap fees werent being paid artists wouldnt even need to sue because bmiascap would
technology,not_removed,because trump is that much of a fucking shitshow you cant even compare the two its disingenuous to say both candidates are terrible because of how much worse one is he is actually concerned that we might elect trump and isnt taking chances
technology,not_removed,hes been doing that a lot in the third season from specific abortion regulation to to explaining how campaign finance works i agreed with your statement until the third season came around hes a bit better now i recommend him over any other comedicnoncomedic political pundit
technology,not_removed,he should be using this platform to draw attention to issues that need it like the one on the deplorable amount of food waste in the us
technology,not_removed,from his viewpoint addressing hillarys issues does nothing but cost her support and she has been the presumptive nominee now she is the nominee and she is going against trump hes doing what he believes is best for america
technology,not_removed,hillarys poor record on honesty he doesnt have a show on this because it isnt a story as for her statements on issues politifact a pulitzer prizewinning factchecking organization gives clinton the best truthtelling record of any of the presidential candidates she beats sanders and kasich and crushes cruz and trump who has the biggest pants on fire rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president i think there is a lot of shows that can be done on the mainstream media and the alternative media and the disregard for basic fact checking and objective reporting that both seem to do i recently got into a debate with someone who was pushing an article they wrote as a researched editorial even though they did none of the basic research we assume journalists do such as interviewing other people finding out objective facts etc and their response was well im a blogger the lack of objectivity is a key factor in the insanity that is this election
technology,not_removed,i mean look at the ops post history
technology,not_removed,my understanding is that the account is already back up and running correct me if i am wrong i am no longer following the story closely but also the artist could start another account and that account would only be removed if he again violated their rules they are still serving him but only in the way they serve everyone to go back to the serving gay people cake the instagram bakery would serve everyone but wouldnt serve anyone gay cake only regular cake this could look like discrimination because gay people would ask for gay cake more often and be refused service and now i want cake
technology,not_removed,you agree that they should censor what they dont approve of kind of a slippery slope no
technology,not_removed,not really disagreeing with any content of this post but is european overlords really in the same category as everything else i meanyou did have a nonsovereign body overseeing certain aspects of your government sorry i realize this is nitpicking
technology,not_removed,it certainly doesnt and its a problem with reddit that a natural monopoly like the name of a nation can be hijacked by agendasetting moderators
technology,not_removed,his campaign website surprisingly goes into a lot more detail than what he says at his rallies
technology,not_removed,if you dont understand that donald hillary are the only two choices in this election you need more education than i can offer here thats not an insult i just mean you deserve a better understanding of the situation
technology,not_removed,hes not hiding his feelings at all he can have personal feelings yet still be unbiased in a professional sense see jon stewart for this and pretty much every person with a sense of professionalism
technology,not_removed,thats where i dont get it sure trump isnt the best but hillary isnt better and is more dangerous since she knows the system and how to fuck with it to get what she wants
technology,not_removed,yup pretty much
technology,not_removed,i sound like a asshole hipster but its fairly accurate that the economics and statistics of bernie s arecloser to jill steins platform not the dnc the dnc party platform is center right i listen to a lot of richard wolf and chris hedges and robert riche
technology,not_removed,have you really given it a shot because thats what i thought at first until i started really watching and paying attention he is fantastic at what he does its like watching jon stewart say everything he wanted to say
technology,not_removed,oh look another person that doesnt know what fascism is
technology,not_removed,do you even know what facism is cause its not something you just throw around left and right regardless of what the news does hes more of the case of what happens when you get pure capitalism added with a deluded sense of grandeur fascism is completely different than that
technology,not_removed,i dont think you know what fascism actually is
technology,not_removed,also not actually a politician i would never vote for romney mccain ron paul etc etcbut at least they were actually politicians and qualified to an extent donald trump is literally just a celebrity
technology,not_removed,your right hillary has the good sense to lie about her lies
technology,not_removed,so hillary hasnt lied
technology,not_removed,yes like that too bad a good segment like that hasnt been shown in the past several weeks
technology,not_removed,such effort
technology,not_removed,i meant that i also dont want trump
technology,not_removed,im not an expert and i wont pretend to be but i know for a fact that things arent as simple as a bunch of people in brussels telling the uk what to do calling someone an overlord only appeals to that image thats all j can say while being sure im not misleading sorry
technology,not_removed,true it at least goes into some detail about his campaigns broader goals if not the specifics he refuses to reveal from what i can tell he has advisors and staffers handle all the concrete policy mumbojumbo so that he can just go out and put on a show without worrying about it look all i know is whats on the internet
technology,not_removed,i dont actually know what youre talking about i talk with loads of people on here unless youre talking about something other than score counting i might not understand this is such an instance
technology,not_removed,i know im agreeing with you this was more in response to that other guy saying how he jon never criticise the democrats
technology,not_removed,but she is better you can argue that shell help wall street and herself but all her policies are rational and more liberal than our current policies if we can liberalize the house and senate so that her plans pass then i dont have a clue how anyone can say she is as bad as trump
technology,not_removed,yeah i agree but you asked why colbert wasnt shining light on the actual left he was a lot he was very much pushing bernie while he was in the race and is openly lamenting that bernie isnt the candidate
technology,not_removed,yep been watching since episode im finding it more of a chore to watch it than a pleasure lately otoh i feel tevor noah is actually starting to get a grip on the daily show now if only we can get him some decent guests
technology,not_removed,cnn and the nyt both have articles calling him a protofascist he certainly isnt trying not to be fascist
technology,not_removed,umm yes i do know what facism is and a man who uses a race as an economic scapegoat to rise to power on a wave of blind nationalism sounds rather facist to me
technology,not_removed,hes a businessman first celebrity second zero part politician but maybe hes wanting that to change hes not really great at anything except for talking loud and pointing now reagan was a celebrity but at least he went into politics a couple decades before presidency
technology,not_removed,i think another delineation is professionalism and to an extent temperment a president on a global scale represents the people of that country and i want a motherfucker that keeps his cool or her cool and also not be a cunt
technology,not_removed,fun fact both of them are uniquely qualified to lead the empire now ask me if i think we should be and empire
technology,not_removed,right but censorship in order to stop him is that ok with you
technology,not_removed,if voting for gary means you wont be voting for donald ie donald is your choice you have my support i want you to convince all of your conservative friends to also vote for gary
technology,not_removed,oh i read that as the opposite way carry on
technology,not_removed,the republicans should be rebelling against the state of their party as opposed to the dnc where people were actively rebelling
technology,not_removed,she does everything for her own selfish gain and benefit of her donors after all the shit shes been proven to have done for her own gain and to cover her ass how can you even say shes not equally bad or worse trump was motivated by greed that i can understand even if i dont condone it hillary is motivated by lust for power which is something ill never understand defending her is just as moronic as people saying trump is a good choice oh and thinking more liberal is better is something you really need to educate yourself about because more liberal does not make it better
technology,not_removed,i would have agreed with you a year ago but now looking back we see bsanders rhetoric is really the green party platform richard d wolf thomas pickity chris hedges jill steins bernie worked super hard for years campaigning for the dnc policies clinton etc but the dnc is not a socialist party they are a neoliberal party to the bone
technology,not_removed,this isnt an endorsement of trump at all and i absolutely will not vote for him but what he is doing is much closer to the political model in japan its not uncommon at all for someone to enter politics after spending a majority of their career in the private sector
technology,not_removed,reagan was a piece of shit terrible president
technology,not_removed,global scale doesnt matter when the person youre talking about is anti globalism
technology,not_removed,no i think he should be shot
technology,not_removed,woot that means were friends again
technology,not_removed,more liberal doesnt make it worse either her plans are better than trumps though i didnt say she was a great nominee but shes deffinitely the better candidate of the
technology,not_removed,trickle downvoteanomics
technology,not_removed,but pro cunt apparently
technology,not_removed,haha alright hillary should be shot in my opinion
technology,not_removed,did you know that jill gary have quite drastically different views on economics
technology,not_removed,you are right its all pretty crazy right now
technology,not_removed,wtf are you talking about we are pissed about inside party corruption end of story htc is a shake and we got her shoved down our throats by agenda driven
technology,not_removed,well then you are an idiot who sucks at hyperbolic strawman arguments stick to the subject at hand please
technology,not_removed,i too hate being called out
technology,not_removed,well theres a fucking idea its depressing that it even needs to be said
technology,not_removed,before these bills even get voted on every state senator or representative should have a required meeting with their states ctopres has their own cto they should be required to meet with as well some might but most wont because they prefer not talk with them technology is something that should not be shackled by ignorant politicians who only know how to look up porn do email and browse if they think opening encryption up more is a good thing they are really wrong they will understand the error of their ways when all their personal ip money assets and identity is more easily stolen by hacker groups sure you give the nsa more power over the people but you give the enemy even greater power because the enemy does not care about any other than stealing your money or attacking you because they are bored and can
technology,not_removed,encryption is mathematics rather than technology so they may as well try and regulate long division
technology,not_removed,no fucking shit the obama administration and other antisecurity policy pushers have been trying to break encryption which would simply take the power from developers and consumers and give it to anybody amoral enough to learn how to exploit builtin government vulnerabilities
technology,not_removed,never stopped them before and likely will not stop them in the future politicians for the most party are only concerned with staying in power and delivering on their private promises so they keep getting money understanding anything else is not required
technology,not_removed,sorry but getting republicans to learn about science or technology doesnt work they still deny humancaused climate change
technology,not_removed,so youre saying that letting letting my grandma who can barely use email set our national tech policy is a bad thing the hell you say
technology,not_removed,epa warning that water may be wet more at
technology,not_removed,i really hope if they learn more they dont try to use their new knowledge for the same shitty goals
technology,not_removed,thank the stars kneels down cries a little
technology,not_removed,this is obvious to anyone that has the slightest inkling as to what encryption is and what it actually does i am not going to tell someone how to build a house because i dont know how to build a fucking house
technology,not_removed,if they are too dumb to listen to cryptography experts why would they be smart enough to listen to this report or do we need another report from even lesser experts telling them to listen to such reports
technology,not_removed,its a shame they didnt come to that conclusion before doing the obamacare thing the sheer amount of bitching my dad a physician does about obamacare borders on comical its like they didnt ask for input from actual practicing doctors
technology,not_removed,unfortunately most congressmen dont know anything about most of the bills they vote on the majority of their time is spent trying to get money for their next campaign
technology,not_removed,can we make that rule for everything technology guns cars etc
technology,not_removed,lawmakers need to to learn more about technology before trying to regulate it is it just me or did i hear a few million voices all yell out duh at the same time
technology,not_removed,what was your first clue sherlock
technology,not_removed,what no no learning only regulate
technology,not_removed,maybe congress should have an office of technology assessment which could give congress advice on highly complicated issues of science and technology oh wait we had one of those and newt gingrich destroyed it
technology,not_removed,its not just republicans that need to learn things i agree they need to learn about climate change liberals are also against encryption and could stand to learn a lot too
technology,not_removed,this report was written by republican staffers who apparently took the time to learn about encryption
technology,not_removed,deny are paid to say otherwiseftfy
technology,not_removed,is the sun bright find out at
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,who runs bartertown
technology,not_removed,the saddest part is they are so stupid they still think it was a good idea
technology,not_removed,but a manhattan project against encryption sounds so muscular dont be such an antifeminist
technology,not_removed,well this is about the time i remind people that there was one party that completely gutted the staffing of the us congress because that function supposedly could be outsourced to lobbyists like for instance the office of technology assessment ill just mention the name newt gingrich and as for the report the committees report does perpetuate a few oversimplifications of the encryption debate for instance in the first line of the report says that public interest in encryption has surged once it was revealed that terrorists behind the paris and san bernardino attacks used encrypted communications to evade detection
technology,not_removed,trick question its dark then
technology,not_removed,didnt the paris attacks involve non encrypted cell phones
technology,not_removed,yep they just used burners
technology,not_removed,dont be hatin on them theyre just like us they are just people enjoying their lives just like you do he said theres no reason to be full of hate because they have something and you dont have it
technology,not_removed,wow that article certainly wont be biased at all s that said i actually agree with fox on this one allowing more candidates and therefore more viewpoints in a debate should be a good thing regardless of who pays for it
technology,not_removed,i like how the article barely explains why the democrat commissioners voted the way they did or what the rule was and how it was violated so until i am told the details im just going to safely assume this is more typical fear mongering from the gop media machine
technology,not_removed,haha the democrats are terrified about having to include jill stein in the debates
technology,not_removed,so you read the clearly biased article and decided to form an opinion on the subject anyway and what do you know you side with fox news just as the author planned
technology,not_removed,yep i know i was surprised too
technology,not_removed,is there anything else down insert ops mom jokes here
technology,not_removed,the internets license ran out were shutting down
technology,not_removed,us handed over the internet to furriners
technology,not_removed,so basically the uk is a cyber terrorist group that the world has to actively defend against
technology,not_removed,they dont need charters laws to snooper on people because lets face it whos watching the watcher
technology,not_removed,plot twist everywhere is overseas from somewhere
technology,not_removed,lets ignore the emotions we feel as humans entitled to privacy and be rational for a second this is exactly what these agencies are built for thats their mission whether it be nsa or gchq or whoever why are we surprised we want them to have that ability should the need arise thats why we give them a bunch of money after all its not exactly a secret
technology,not_removed,when we do it its fine when the chinese do it it is an act of war
technology,not_removed,yeah its totally irrational to fear abusive overreach by extremely powerful intelligence agencies thats something that has never ever happened before at any time in history and theres no need for any costbenefit considerations when discussing how much power these agencies should have s
technology,not_removed,cool to have my own personal satellite sign me up ill buy one as soon as i can
technology,not_removed,cool
technology,not_removed,one in five smartphone users or almost million people worldwide blocking advertising when browsing the web on cellphones credit data caps who wants to waste their data allotment on ads especially when they can possibly mask malware
technology,not_removed,anyone got advice for what adblock to use i have a samsung galaxy
technology,not_removed,to watch a sec video on utube i have to watch a second ad you fucking bet i am blocking ads
technology,not_removed,i have a really hard time believing one of every smartphone users is ad blocking the general public just isnt that smart i know i used to work in wireless and the average cell user is utterly clueless
technology,not_removed,is there an adblocker for ios
technology,not_removed,no objection to them making a living if its not killing my data but that flashing
technology,not_removed,the adification of the mobile experience was truly much worse than desktop users between the limited screen real estate low relative bandwidth and caps its a terribly experience for those that use phones as their primary source of computing
technology,not_removed,the ads are out of control period people are offended angry and when all your ads load but not the content i originally clicked on a page for i want to shoot someone in the facenot buy your crap
technology,not_removed,the bbc reported that german millennial males an important demographic for europe are blocking at sites like the guardian have a real issue providing important investigative journalism when people believe that they should just get content out of the goodness of other peoples hearts
technology,not_removed,for the people saying that we should be forced to look at ads do you consider it equally as wrong to refuse to buy any product that you see annoying ads for online
technology,not_removed,ads that arent computer viruses are mind viruses anyway block them all
technology,not_removed,thats actually a much larger percentage than i thought
technology,not_removed,thank you based samsung for adblocking capabilities
technology,not_removed,so whats a good ad blocker for android
technology,not_removed,everyone one wants to block ads no one wants to pay for content this doesnt work out well for anyone
technology,not_removed,absolutely in a world of metered data ads are totally unacceptable
technology,not_removed,its not even malware or datacaps that is the problem its that some ads are so outrageous that they deserve to be blocked fully screen ads with a small x in the corner deserve to be blocked
technology,not_removed,i remember switching to adsl after years of having dial up at home unmetered and fast internet whenever i wanted to learn about reproduction that was the future for any young kid back then mobile data caps are annoying and reminds me of the era before when i had to figure out how to block images and load texts only for speed and i had to restrict myself to certain hours for cheaper bills adblocking is a natural way of dealing with the present restriction funny that american companies want their customers to relive that era at home now
technology,not_removed,firefox with ublock origin if your phone isnt rooted
technology,not_removed,ublock origin for firefox works great
technology,not_removed,adguard doesnt need root
technology,not_removed,i block at the router and use adblock browser which is based on chrome
technology,not_removed,where are you according to the report the number of smartphone users in the us and europe that are blocking ads on their phones is quite small its in asia where the numbers are quite high
technology,not_removed,yes i use adblock and weblock by futuremind and a safari inline blocker as well focus by mozilla combined they actually make ios palatable
technology,not_removed,not for apps but safari supports add blockers which you can download from the app store for example i use purify although i havent really kept up to date about which are the best since they were added
technology,not_removed,honestly i basically dont browse web on my mobile like i actively do anything i can to avoid it it isnt the datacap for me its the frustration of ridiculous load times the delay in having a popup appear just after the page loads when im starting to interact with it or the page just flat out crashing under the strain of different javascript files all trying to track me and sell my second visit to what was probably an article that in my heart of hearts i really dont give a single fuck about anyway im just waiting for the goddamn bus i just surf reddit and have given up on the rest of the web on mobile
technology,not_removed,what if its not rooted
technology,not_removed,well there was a time when that was a reality at one time word traveled a little less efficiently and not everyone got paid for spreading the word it wasnt until the corruption by money that all information was held behind a paywall do you honestly think that ads are saving these companies that provide content seriously they are paid pennies on the thousands of dollars made on providing ads ad companies have gotten aggressive since the as well not only do they provide ads but have you even seen some pages without an adblocker it looks like a fucking web page from the with all the moving images that are trying to sell you something and they arent gifs of sparkling part content parts adsand that is only part of what is pissing people off enough to use adblockers to top this off lots of isps globally have bandwidth caps with heavy overage charges and ad providers fucking love video ads to get your attention another thing lately is in the ad provider greed they dont even quality check ads they just let malicious code in malicious sites in and peoples computers are compromised as a direct result of their lack of qc
technology,not_removed,its not that they dont deserve to be paid or whatever its just that after so many years of being blasted with ads i no longer wish to be subjected to them no matter the cost
technology,not_removed,how do you enable it
technology,not_removed,wrong ads have gotten out of control which made ad blocking mandatory it is no coincidence that mobile ad blocking is increasing one only has to look at the increasing obnoxiousness of mobile ads
technology,not_removed,we are going to force them to change from an annoying useless for consumers system of advertising to something more imaginative there is too much money to be made they will make it they will find a way we for the first time ever have the power to say no we dont want ads and we wont stand for it anymore they can come up with something new or they can die
technology,not_removed,they are but what is the alternative are we prepared to pay for every site we visit because the sites have to have revenue somehow
technology,not_removed,adaway if you are rooted
technology,not_removed,ahh that would explain it ok in those terms i can accept that
technology,not_removed,either you have a bad phone or a bad wireless carrier
technology,not_removed,theres an app that acts as a vpn that only filters the ads for android
technology,not_removed,it only works with certain samsung phones httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomsecandroidappsbrowser or you could just download firefox for android and install the ublock origin add on inside firefox this will work with nearly all android phones not just certain samsung phones
technology,not_removed,even if ads become better most of the people who got used to adblockers wont switch them off
technology,not_removed,youre carting before the horse every site on the net is dealing with the precedence of being free most businesses cannot operate on that model without significant ads google has only done well because they are synonymous with search people having developed expectations that things remain free repeatedly move on once service fees are introduced the byproduct of this has been massive ads to draw more attention to them its the only way to pay for things as adblockers are introduced and people continuing to be unwilling to pay for things the ads get worse if youve ever paid for a service like a harvard business review or spotify you notice the experience is mostly adfree and the quality is way higher
technology,not_removed,we are going to force them to change from an annoying useless for consumers system of advertising to something more imaginative like what i mean where can they get the money if we dont want to pay directly and we wont allow them to sell us to advertisers who else is even willing to pay them anything
technology,not_removed,there were sites on the internet back when it started free and payed dont believe people who say free sites in general would vanish without ads
technology,not_removed,no when there was less advertising there were plenty of good web sites they were easier to find too
technology,not_removed,ive seen studies that peg the average user as being worth id happily portion that out to the sites i visit
technology,not_removed,this solution has the added advantage of blocking many ads in apps other than the browser which is pretty much essential in my eyes
technology,not_removed,how do one do such a magical thing
technology,not_removed,httpsfdroidorgrepositorybrowsefdideufaircodenetguard is a good opensource option it does a clever trick where its both a vpn client and vpn server in one app thus being able to control all traffic automatically without needing root its normally used as a kind of app firewall but it can also mimic hostsfile blocking functionality like adaway does the downside is that its more resourceintensive than adaway and afwall the usual two rooted options some lowend tablets and phones might not be able to handle it my zenpad is noticeably slower with netguard running than it is with the adawayafwall combo running
technology,not_removed,wouldnt that only work for inside the browser though instead of across all applications
technology,not_removed,well never know because we all know that the ad industry will only make ads worse they have no self control and ads will only become more obnoxious deceptive dangerous misleading etc even if it means destroying their own industry blaming the end user will never be a good solution
technology,not_removed,youve in a befuddled way explained it all in chasing dollars many have given up content quality and standards and will do anything for revenue they plaster ads everywhere will use the most obnoxious ad techniques and wont lift a finger to avoid dangerous ads then blame the end users for blocking all that bullshit the mobile web has been fairly as block free instead of encouraging that the mobile web has become a cesspool of shit advertising and will only encourage the use of adblockers on mobile too no cart before the horse at all all youve done is attempt to shift the blame to end users and excuse the abuses of the truly guilty
technology,not_removed,i dont know its up to them to find something
technology,not_removed,some people simply dont care im one of them advertising is shoved in peoples faces so much that it literally changes the way we think think back to do you know anyone who would have paid dollars a month for a tv package that is and ads i dont think so the ads have just been creeping up on everyone at a pace to get the whole world used to them i could not care less if a bunch of websites get shut down because of this i just dont want ads in my face all day every day everywhere i look
technology,not_removed,any site with traffic worth mentioning is going to cost money to run the internet as we know it can not possibly exist without either ads or paywalls free sites in general would definitely vanish if they dont generate income in some way comparing the modern internet with early internet are you joking or what
technology,not_removed,they wont vanish completely but diversity will decrease big free sites will only be able to exist if a company sponsors them for example this will bring fewer independent opinions because free sites will have to follow the agenda of their sponsors without independent sponsoring like ads where multiple companies provide the revenue stream the editorial independence of sites will diminish
technology,not_removed,because i visit a lot of sites
technology,not_removed,yes but thats what users are worth not what they cost the site owner
technology,not_removed,just inside the browser
technology,not_removed,im not even talking about something im talking about someone forget the specifics of how it works who will pay advertisers are out readers are out politicians that wont work business leaders nope bad idea whats left taxes
technology,not_removed,without adblockers many pages with their blinking ads look like in the anyway and the internet is not only webpages there are lots of other services there that dont have to be payed that can be run yourself or that are cheap and immensely powerful the internet has not changed so much since the except for making its way forward the rest is still the same the web well thats another question but its not all better while in the nineties ads where used to get some money to pay for the cost of a webservice webservices are now built to shift ads to users the focus has changed a lot while we are here on reddit have a look at this
technology,not_removed,comparing the modern internet with early internet are you joking or what yeah things are a lot cheaper now it would be even easier to stay free without ads then it was then
technology,not_removed,nah just a kiddie that thinks because his parents support him everything should be free for the entitled kiddies no matter that it costs someone else i have seen what a fair sized site costs to operate it aint cheap
technology,not_removed,not sure what your point is the number i quoted is allegedly what a user is worth in terms of ad revenue thats the number we should be concerned with replacing if we want a world without online ads
technology,not_removed,capitalism will solve it consumers are saying we dont want ads enterprising smart people will come with the solutions we will force that to happen by blocking ads
technology,not_removed,news sites video sites search engines porn sites social media etc would all disappear if there wouldnt be any ads or paywalls the internet is not only webpages sure but without them the internet would be drastically different
technology,not_removed,or we could return to a web where people werent seen as the product and exploited in the form of obnoxious ads and behavioral tracking
technology,not_removed,the internet would be drastically different absolutely the claim news and video sites and search engines and social media would vanish is heard often but has not once been proven i can however prove the opposite most of my communication runs over nonprofit or even free community driven servers communication does not cost so much cpu power its preparing the user data for sales which does video sites well for most sites i couldnt care less if they vanished they might be fun to have around but absolutely not necessary social media there are enough alternatives you can use them especially the open source ones where you can setup your own server if you want or simply join one of the free a bonus is that these projects are probably not filtering your message stream to influence others like facebook did and does same for video audio calls use xmpp jabber and you are good to go or tox or all free search engines might be a thing but there are a few good one around that are publicly financed might be university research projects but are ready to jump in a good transparent search engine project might even be something i would give some money to the same for wikipedia one question that you have to ask yourself is what would you really miss and how much would you pay for it if your answer is very much and zero money you are being sold by other people for their own benefit if it is not much and some money you would survive just fine if it is very much and much money you are probably already paying a lot of money without realising it amazon affiliate links and similar
technology,not_removed,if you dont pay with ads then youll pay for access like in case of tv you have free channels with ads or you have paid channels
technology,not_removed,video sites well for most sites i couldnt care less if they vanished they might be fun to have around but absolutely not necessary video sites are very important for citizen journalism you dont have to go to a tv channel to have your content accepted to air because anyone can publish videos on youtube and similar sites whistleblowing etc currently we take youtubelike sites for granted and it would be a great loss if they stopped being freely available
technology,not_removed,thing is im not really paying with ads im paying with my privacy the number of third parties profiling you for everything youre worth if you dont block everything is just mind boggling the whole but they need revenue argument will fall flat on me until these extreme invasions are dealt with but of course they never will be
technology,not_removed,that is true but if it was for the information itself we might read a bit more that worked before whistleblowing never happened on youtube as far as i know the information was published elsewhere and then people started making videos on the topics
technology,not_removed,whistleblowing happened on liveleak so by youtube i generally meant all free video streaming sites also whistleblowing is only one example there are videos of police brutality captured with phone cameras or even just some big event terrorist attack natural catastrophe etc where now you can find hundreds of eyewitness video captures of the event showing different perspectives instead of only the short clips shown by news channels and there are the countless educational content on video sites which anyone can access freely with only an internet connection also artisan videos showing solutions for everyday problems home improvement cooking etc so there is lots of free useful content which you would have to pay for and therefore less available for poorer people if these sites stopped being free
technology,not_removed,why have oversight its not like all the major voting machine companies are owned by one partys leadershipooops

technology,not_removed,will we get better ping in games how can i test the new cable
technology,not_removed,the specific cable being talked about here is faster for anyone who didnt read the article but is curious
technology,not_removed,its a google cable i think
technology,not_removed,it looks like google will only use of the available they did say this though dedicated bandwidth to this region results in faster data transfers and reduced latency as gcp customers deliver their applications and information to customers around the globe which seems to indicate that it will improve throughput and latency
technology,not_removed,the newer tech in fiber has way better throughput and far better latency
technology,not_removed,i had more sympathy for itman than for the author at the end of this article that level of service is hard to come by way to skip on the bill ars
technology,not_removed,i let them in a vm of mine and recorded it all was hoping they would login somewhere so i could steal their creds
technology,not_removed,itman is a real bro he doesnt want to fuck your shit up he just wants to give you a pirated copy of office for
technology,not_removed,i guess they need to find some use for all that money they have overseas
technology,not_removed,thats literally a drop in the bucket small potatoes compared to the billions they have parked
technology,not_removed,for the love of god why doesnt blackberry make a keyboard attachment for android and iphones they could get away with charging a pop and people would buy them
technology,not_removed,the only reason i bought a priv was a hardware keyboard on android its by no means a powerhouse it gets whipped by the latest samsungs and oneplus still its a very nice mature experience if bb take the specs of the oneplus and slap a hardware keyboard on it game over
technology,not_removed,theyll take release a phone with flagship specs in just be patient
technology,not_removed,capacitive touchscreen keyboards are neither more accurate nor more reliable they are accurate and reliable enough to serve but the true benefits are customisation more screen real estate and less moving parts
technology,not_removed,good enough to be worth the tradeoffs for most people certainly but not everyone most of what i do on my phone is type and its technical messages laden with acronyms and other things not suited to autocompleteautocorrect im not particularly unique among people who use their phones for work more than play i dont care if its small sleek or has the highest res screen it might be a niche but theres no one else selling modern android phones in the us with a keyboard so its their niche
technology,not_removed,capacitive touchscreen device keyboards are more accurate and more reliable than any keyboard idk about that man it really comes down to preference and voice to text smokes either solution
technology,not_removed,which is still not as bad as apple
technology,not_removed,what do you mean apples spanks the shit out of any snapdragon apples camera is constantly at the top with samsung apple phones last longer than android phones without rootingcustom roms what are you trying to say
technology,not_removed,the spanks the shit out of any snapdragon you mean the phone that came out weeks ago beats phones out much longer well damn waterproofing has been in phones for years their screens are shit their speakers are shit no wireless charging no fast charging
technology,not_removed,i have a iphone and a iphone personal and work phones respectively and for me the screen and speakers suit my needs amply i dont need the wireless charging and i find they charge pretty quickly too not gunna lie id love a bigger battery as i play hearthstone on it and that tends to chew up the battery something fierce but excluding hearthstone game time i can get days usage out of the phone with regular textingmailspotifyredditimgur usage yeah waterproofing is nice but im sensible enough so as to not leave my device in a place where it is susceptible to getting submerged in water im not a swimmer and i dont put my phone on the edge of the sink either the jack disappearing in the however
technology,not_removed,i mean you are fine with subpar specs and missing features thats great man i am not my current phone suits me better than any iphone could amoled screen fast charging i cant expect much more from a phone
technology,not_removed,genuinely i cant say at this moment i really need a screen for my mobile personal preference though hardware specs alone ios suits me really well it isnt perfect but it is simply just easy to use i find android os are just overzealous with the customisation they offer when i really just need a platform for my apps to run smoothly in its also a huge positive with work as it staff having a device that a year old can use to a certain degree bodes well when dealing with staff members of very limited it knowledge
technology,not_removed,hey man tech is about choice you dont need the customization and cutting edge features and tech of android that is fine
technology,not_removed,i find android os are just overzealous with the customisation they offer what how can customization be bad
technology,not_removed,this is why i turned away from android people like you mate not a single clueless fuck what youre going on about
technology,not_removed,i dont think customisation is bad some people really like it and i completely get that i just dont want it ive tried android lollipop before and whilst its not that bad i just liked the layout and convenience of ios better
technology,not_removed,why should i give a fuck about you leaving android go for subpar specs and missingoutdated features you do you man
technology,not_removed,you stopped using a product because you dont like the user base thats weird i dont give a fuck who like or dislikes anything i use
technology,not_removed,alright man dont cry just because my phone doesnt need a quadcore processor and of ram just to watch youtube doesnt mean you gotta get upset
technology,not_removed,it was the deciding vote but it was a factor
technology,not_removed,yep i am crying i watch youtube videos on my super amoled display and i cry i long for a nice nonamoled screen
technology,not_removed,if youre crying you might want to consider switching phones
technology,not_removed,yea thinking about getting an iphone for a screen seems like a great deal to me
technology,not_removed,yeah they seem to be good phones that processor is very powerful as well of course you could always just save a little money and pick up the if youre not too worried about doing anything intensive on it ios is very well optimized for the hardware it runs on isnt that great im a blackberry user myself but i own a and i think its a great device
technology,not_removed,downvote for cnbc autoplay hard to mute and cares that i have an adblocker
technology,not_removed,competing with uber is a moral imperative says uber competitor
technology,not_removed,then lets talk about how you want to legally bar people from using their own car in any rideshare program other than your own elon
technology,not_removed,butuber is made out of people
technology,not_removed,and there goes any hope of me ever buying his things when i own something i get to decide how its used not someone else
technology,not_removed,oh go sit in a simulation musk
technology,not_removed,no one cares
technology,not_removed,lets talk about how rideshare companies are copouts
technology,not_removed,he doesnt want to own the cars he wants you to so that you make money that would be extremely beneficial for the economyy he has enough money and he knows it
technology,not_removed,or we could talk about his hyperloop scam
technology,not_removed,so you dont opt in
technology,not_removed,did you not read the fucking article
technology,not_removed,the site cares read
technology,not_removed,do you have a source for that as none of the links you posted appear to be relevant to the matter at hand because ive seen a lot of drivers that drive for uber and lyft not to mention even if such a clause did exist if someone else was offering a better rate to drivers they could just quit uber and go drive for that other company with a tesla youd need to sell your car before you could use it in a ridesharing program that wasnt teslas
technology,not_removed,lets talk about how mcdonalds and co lobied to keep minimum wages low
technology,not_removed,he wants to prevent you from using the car you own in any rideshare program not owned by him
technology,not_removed,elon musk wants to fund the colonization of mars he does not have enough money for those dreams and he definitely knows it he is not a man that thinks or dreams small and he is literally looking to shoot past the moon and into the greater solar system and very possibly beyond within his life time technology permitting i would not be surprised if elon musk is the first elderly gentlemen in decades in the future to pass away of old age on mars
technology,not_removed,how is it a scam he hasnt asked anyone for any money for it
technology,not_removed,yeah he wants to limit what people who buy the car can do
technology,not_removed,thats not true at all and i dont know where people are getting this information from tesla is in no way planning to block people from driving their car for a ride share program they are blocking people from using their car in self driving mode for other ride sharing programs if you want to put in the work yourself and manually drive the car you can do whatever you want but if you want to just sit back and let your car make money for you then you will have to do it through teslas official program now we can have a debate on whether or not tesla should handle their self driving capabilities this way i think as long as tesla gives the owner the lions share its perfectly reasonable but at least stop spreading the lie that tesla is trying to stop you from using all other ride share programs
technology,not_removed,what does that have to do with uber uber is a fake company it costs a lot more to be a driver than people realize and the gig economy is a scam its a cash grab and nothing more and the goal is to replace those people with automation too that is the only correlation mcdonalds actually creates products and soon their robots will be putting those products together so who cares about their low wages that wont exist in the future
technology,not_removed,thats not true they arent stopping you from using other ride share programs they are stopping you from using other ride share programs via self driving see my reply to the comment above
technology,not_removed,not whatsoever you have to optin
technology,not_removed,they are blocking people from using their car in self driving mode for other ride sharing programs thats just as bad once they sell it they should have zero input on how the owners of it can use it
technology,not_removed,ok i get it if you want to allow your car to self drive and make you money then you can only do it through tesla thats still bullshit
technology,not_removed,absolutely try living on what you can make with uber and then try living on what you make at mcdonalds same deal its crap the relevance is in the compensation both receive its shit and this problem is systemic unless you have a job that requires years of education or has other protections in place few do these days the trend is towards reducing compensation packages one way or another inevitably this happens in the form of visas and similar mcdonalds actually creates products and soon their robots will be putting those products together so who cares about their low wages that wont exist in the future i hope you arent in logistics because automation is coming for that and more automation is the future but what we have to worry about is now and if you want to talk copout companies every bloody company has a single goal maximize profits everything else is done as a means to that end
technology,not_removed,which is still your car not theirs one reason i wont ever own a tesla they think they control the car and not you they can lock you out if they want to update software on a whim remove functionality and then just say terms of service lol
technology,not_removed,if they wanted other ride sharing programs to work with it then they would need to write an api that went through teslas servers to tell the car where to go
technology,not_removed,its more complicated then that as soon as we get into autonomous vehicles without an active driver and this is what we are inevitably talking about who is to blame when a car working for abc ride sharing limited kills someone or otherwise causes damage tesla motors they wrote the driving software responsible for the vehicles actions abc ride sharing limited they were using the vehicle for commercial purpose the teslas owner is the least likely is the most likely so all tesla is doing is hedging against a scenario of taking the blame of a collision while not gaining the profit from operating the vehicle in a ride share fleet and that is just good business
technology,not_removed,its a software use license issue youre not purchasing a tangible object like a car youre purchasing the software use licenses are generally legal
technology,not_removed,no the liability is still with tesla for the selfdriving portion if you legally transferred that liability to the owner of the vehicle it would make sense but youd have to be a complete moron to accept liability for source code that you dont even have and have never inspected because of this legal hurdle it makes sense for tesla to try and limit their liability
technology,not_removed,try living on what you can make with uber and then try living on what you make at mcdonalds same deal its crap they place food items on other food items theres a reason why they dont make a lot and if you want to talk copout companies every bloody company has a single goal maximize profits everything else is done as a means to that end its easy to say that because its the main goal but it casts a blanket over a lot of good companies that take care of their employees and the company and dont want to just grab the first dollar they can see in front of them
technology,not_removed,you dont own the car you are merely leasing the software and hardware for an unlimited amount of time welcome to the futuretm
technology,not_removed,correct it is your car unless you are leasing and tesla has always acted as such theyve never locked anyone out of their car theyve never removed functionality and since when is free software updates that improve efficiency patch security issues and add features a bad thing tesla is the only car manufacturer that i know of that improves your car over time for free and with very little hassle what we are talking about is tesla initiating a clause on their self driving software for liability reasons no other car on the planet has this feature or potential feature since the software isnt there yet for tesla so there is nothing else to compare this to but i imagine any other self driving cars will have similar clauses if not forcing you to stick to a proprietary service at least absolving them from any responsibility while using such services just look at how recklessly people are using their current autopilot software ignoring warnings from tesla and using autopilot outside of its intended usage and then trying to blame tesla when something goes wrong having all tesla owners use teslas official service is the easiest way to make sure the software is used correctly and maintenance is up to date i dont like the idea of tesla limiting their products either but we arent talking about limiting features on a laptop or a video game we are talking about software controlling a ton vehicle shuttling live people around safety is of the highest importance and i think this is the best way for tesla to ensure proper usage elon has said that owners would get the majority of the income from the service and as long as this comes to be i think its a fine solution if tesla starts taking large cuts from their service then we can complain as of now people are complaining about being limited in the ways they can have their car make money for them by doing literally nothing i understand why people would be frustrated by this but i dont think tesla is unreasonable for doing it
technology,not_removed,are you taking full liability if anything goes wrong with the autopilot if not no its not your option to do so and what this tos does is probides tesla a way out of paying for liability of something they were not part of the loop save for providing the tool unless legal precident sets forth that only the opperator of the vehicle at the time of collission is held responsible for any and all infractions then tesla must protect itself in any way it can through the legal process and in this case telling you you may not use the autopilot service for commercial purpose save for through our own network
technology,not_removed,good business yes something that should be legal no
technology,not_removed,they can try to limit it all they want until they try to tell people what they cant or cant do with items they paid for wouldnt they still be liable if it wasnt uber but you or me that was using it at accident time they got their money from the car they dont need to try to put drm crap in cars if ford gm etc had an issue with a car they made and it caused a death theyd rightfully be the ones in trouble tesla should too
technology,not_removed,they place food items on other food items theres a reason why they dont make a lot informing the consequent form of your argument falls under if a then b but im glad you buy into mcdonalds marketing campaign from decades ago still but you havent actually followed mcdonalds have you and the corporate lobbying they support and partake in or the lawsuits against the company or other problems such as it legally attempting to shelter the corperation against individual franchisees abusing employees etc but really could you at least agree that they should be paid the same rate as janitors after all they have to clean up after your mess when you leave and unlike janitors have to deal with routinely rude crude and otherwise disrespectful assholes who walk through the doors for their mcburgers and mcfries and super sized mcsodas it casts a blanket over a lot of good companies that take care of their employees taking care of employees can often result in reduced operational costs never presume a company does something out of the goodness of its heart without some form of cost benefit analysis behind it but let us be clear being ubers primary source of labor comes from contracting with individuals these individuals do not add to training costs etc and with sufficient supply of potential contractors looking to make an extra or so dollars a day well not exactly a great incentive for compensating well so lets just go ahead and realize that everyone deserves a right to a decent living while trying to pay for school or otherwise improve themselves and not everyone can work as ceos etc there simply needs to be someone who ends up doing the things that no one else wants to
technology,not_removed,once battery tech maturesdoubles in density halves the recharge time halves the cost the retrofitting of old cars to electric will be a huge market
technology,not_removed,should be legal no what even does that mean maybe you missed a comma indicating that it shouldnt be legal of what tesla is doing well the unfortunate truth for you is their is legal precident and justifiable reasoning for teslas stance and that stance is inevitably going to be entrenched unless legeslation is set in place that promotes interconnectedness of ride share services to promote transportation at the lowest cost which simply isnt going to happen and this means liability claims must be mitigated vs profitability otherwise every owner of a tesla will share in increased cost of ownership as a result of a handful of ugly lawsuits that are near inevitable to occur we are looking at a new time and a very big change in the line between what you own and what you lease or in this case lease access to
technology,not_removed,taking care of employees can often result in reduced operational costs never presume a company does something out of the goodness of its heart without some form of cost benefit analysis behind it truly blind i see
technology,not_removed,but im glad you buy into mcdonalds marketing campaign from decades ago still but you havent actually followed mcdonalds have you and the corporate lobbying they support and partake in or the lawsuits against the company or other problems such as it legally attempting to shelter the corperation against individual franchisees abusing employees etc marketing campaign no its because i understand the economics of cheap fast food but really could you at least agree that they should be paid the same rate as janitors after all they have to clean up after your mess when you leave and unlike janitors have to deal with routinely rude crude and otherwise disrespectful assholes who walk through the doors for their mcburgers and mcfries and super sized mcsodas no i dont agree and if i find myself in one of their locations i dont leave some mess that their employees need to clean up many patrons clean up after themselves assholes that do are simply that its rare youll improve that person they work for a company that is very templated they dont do much and to even argue they should be worth more is mind blogging you dont force companies to pay their employees more simply because you believe they should be paid more the money just isnt there and in good time those jobs wont exist deserves a right to a decent living while trying to pay for school or otherwise improve themselves your pretty much pushing for universal basic jobs which isnt a solution its more of the same crap these jobs need to go away you dont prop them up with higher wages
technology,not_removed,i doubt it would be cheap enough to be worthwhile theres a lot of bureaucracy surrounding car safety some of it for very good reasons that make conversions costly as hell
technology,not_removed,yeah forgot a comma and if thats the future we have i can only pray we fight it tooth an nail otherwise they shouldnt be selling us something we cant own if they make bad software and someone gets hurt thats their fault i hope uber lawers up big time
technology,not_removed,your pretty much pushing for universal basic jobs which isnt a solution its more of the same crap these jobs need to go away you dont prop them up with higher wages they need to go away sure but until such a time that we change the mentality of society to accept that not everyone will be constantly and conistently gainfully employed within society do to a combination that includes a large level of automation we must look at ways of enabling people to better themselves whenever and wherever they can one of the biggest problems in the us is student load debt and the low paying jobs they are able to find given their schedules etc is one issue relating to this problem they work for a company that is very templated they dont do much and to even argue they should be worth more is mind blogging how you have student load debt a degree that turns out other people have and there are possitions open for you need to start paying your debt and you need a job the job you have is low paying but it pays the bills if you argue or fight for higher wages you get replaced by the next smuck in line that needs the job this is the reality many people live in not most but enough and it is a problem a problem mostly born of go get an education to get a good job in a time when private education is for profit instead of for education the system isnt honest about prospects and realities of the job market and if you looked at what we actually need in our society its not more employees its more innovative risk taking entrepreneurs but society doesnt teach you how to become one our education system is based on the roots founded in the era of the industrial revolution which has a main goal of producing what amounts to drones we need some pretty massive societal changes within the next decade or things are going to get really rough
technology,not_removed,not really when it comes to aftermarket modifications theres not that much some state inspection laws might be applicable but most of those are more concerned with tiresbrakes and emissions
technology,not_removed,how you have student load debt a degree that turns out other people have and there are possitions open for you need to start paying your debt and you need a job just because they decided to put themselves in debt does not give them a right to a higher paying job or wage your logic is completely flawed leverage is based in reality at a fast food place thats how it works its in no way a skilled position and does not warrant special training and unique skills hence their low wage this is the reality many people live in not most but enough and it is a problem a problem mostly born of go get an education to get a good job in a time when private education is for profit instead of for education no it isnt many kids that go to school pay themselves and supplement a lot with financial aid in terms of the for profit schools people need to do more research before they get involved with these technical schools but their time seems to be coming to an end finally with regulatory bodies finally policing them we dont need massive societal changes education costs will be reduced with ai and automation we will be able to lower the costs and create software that drives learning farther than whats being done today these are things that are happening now the idea that we need more risk takers is flawed too you cant make entrepreneurs and you can barely create opportunity but the one thing we do have control over is research and development you cant just try and inspire people talkers get people in line builders change the world
technology,not_removed,its in no way a skilled position and does not warrant special training and unique skills hence their low wage no its not and im not saying pay them a million dollar sallery im saying just maybe minimum wage should have some semblance to the rate of inflation over the past years and it most definitely does not just because they decided to put themselves in debt does not give them a right to a higher paying job or wage on the contrary we have to look at why and its usually the source of information or encouragement to go to school that lacks the knowledge to push them to really consider what they want what will be a good prospect and inevitably we go to school for things we inevitably hate its why a lot of people drop out in the first year or people never learn to study because of the my kid is special it must be your fault they failed not bill bob and sallies job generation of parents and yes kids need to take ownership of their time energy and goals but we also have to look at the underlying cause when i say there needs to be a systematic change in society i mean it you cant just try and inspire people talkers get people in line builders change the world the builder content to build a home can be inspired to build a collesium it takes a visionary to see it through though we need the mom and pop shops we need the independant coffee shops we need the private niche law firms we need the local bakers and butchers and figuring out how to compete with the giant companies that takes entreupeners and im not saying everyone needs to become one encouraged to be one but our education system needs to be geared towards big thinking and the big picture it needs to be geared towards problem solving and active participation instead of bare minimum effort to pass because lets face it change is coming hard and fast and our society isnt ready its not even close to being ready
technology,not_removed,go live in your dream world but watch out because the mom and pop shops running it will end up closing shop in the end the whole idea that independent means they are better has never held up there is good and bad on both sides and there are more small businesses that are barely able to operate and pay their employees that have plagued this country than big companies big companies have done a lot of good even if its hard for you to admit too many people thinking they can when they really cant cut it in the small business world our system needs to be built on better education not dreams
technology,not_removed,big companies do good on the principle that it makes them money in some way or another i dont believe we should need charities a sufficiently enlightened society would not need wellfare old age pension food stamps make work programs and so on these are patch work solutions for larger problems created by the system of economics that drive our society more smaller companies in any industry that may support it benefits everyone the big reason is you have less vertical distance between the top boss and lowest employee its difficult to turn someone into raw numbers when you know them personally and this means overall there is less crap that goes on and when i say more business owners and small buisness i dont mean to imply that any idiot can run a company efficiently and well most cant but more people can then do and that spirit that idea that anyone can have a job that pays the bills and build something on the side that is real and that is the type of small business start ups im interested in seeing more of
technology,not_removed,buried at the bottom fortunately for the security researchers netsweeper has chosen to drop its lawsuit entirely possibly because pursuing the questionable defamation claims would have put it up against ontarioss version of antislapp laws the protection of public participation act
technology,not_removed,this is rtitlegore in its finest though im not terribly sure why techdirt decided to use this awkward phrasing from the youremakinguslookbadsaidcompanycaughtlookingbad dept
technology,not_removed,if people actually faced consequences for things like this it wouldnt happen you have more legal accountability as a truck driver than as an executive
technology,not_removed,i think that title just gave me an aneurysm
technology,not_removed,wow that had to be the most awkward title in the history of reddit
technology,not_removed,yep this is why we have antislapp laws in some areas good to see these laws stopped this lawsuit
technology,not_removed,supreme fudge would not approve of such laws
technology,not_removed,well thats not a version of anti slapp it is anti slapp but thats a good thing the idea that big companies and wealthy people can cause overly burdensome litigation to prevent things from being published is anathema to democracy the writing in the article was obviously sloppy because the story was that a corporation was forced to drop a frivolous lawsuit against a group exposing the corporations questionable support of repression in a foreign nation but maybe we forgave the bad writing because at least we got to hear the story
technology,not_removed,slashdotesque

technology,not_removed,thats fair but i dont really like their title either i guess that they dont want to give the pr departmentwhich isnt doing a very good job right now the dignity which the typical means of referring to it would provide to it
technology,not_removed,non parlo italiano
technology,not_removed,ive been casually watching the explosion of battery technologies over the last several years to my mind the biggest risk for teslas factory is if it was built too closely adapted to a particular battery type and one of these new types has a major breakthrough that they cant adapt to for some reason
technology,not_removed,as an american its pretty exciting to read hoping it goes well
technology,not_removed,then it is doomed because the gigafactory is guaranteed to be a failure if they only produce batteries
technology,not_removed,he would be better off if he set up a bitcoin mining facility
technology,not_removed,i think the biggest risk will be if the economies of giga scale arent that much greater than the economies of regular scale unless they are saving a lot on logistics it may not even be significantly better than having local factories it doesnt really take that much to build a battery factory lg chem has built large factories in under a year
technology,not_removed,musk has talked about being flexible and accounting for technological advances
technology,not_removed,when i was reading this the first time i thought you were talking about the explosive nature of liion batteries
technology,not_removed,this is not a problem at all unless batteries are made from black holes and you need a cern type of device to create them i dont see how a building cant just change what is in it to make the new type of battery
technology,not_removed,why
technology,not_removed,the material cost for li ion is much lower than the finished product cost this usual means that giga scale can reduce costs further
technology,not_removed,musk talks about a lot of things
technology,not_removed,the building may easily be converted but making batteries involves doing exacting repeatable chemistry and physics in toxic solutions with miles of plumbing thats the main cost of the plant not the building and even minor differences in battery technology might mean ripping up of the processing system and replacing it this is analogous to houses as my daddy a contractor liked to say the cost of a house is not the building but the doorknobs and bathtubs this is much more true in manufacturing just for a very distantly related example a friend of mine who is now long retired was a fabrication guy he worked with sheet metal but his idea of sheet metal might by nickel plate three inches thick or titanium or steel of course one project he worked on was a plant to process corn syrup it turns out that hot corn syrup is quite corrosive and all the plumbing is made of solid nickel an inch or so thick with pipes a foot or more in diameter and big hoppers and tanks feet tall and feet in diameter now ponder the cost of solid nickel they used to make nickels out of it but it became too expensive then ponder the cost of welding nickel plumbing together a single joint might take a day to weld and one of those big tanks might cost more than the entire empty building
technology,not_removed,the gigafactory doubles the global lithium ion output the demand will be just about the same due to most of the cost of the cell being in research and rare elements this will make producing anything but the most superior cells like samsung or lg chem can make uneconomical unless you want to literally go fuck chiner dogs go us there is no purpose in it
technology,not_removed,do you have a source on the material cost being much lower than finished product cost paper seems to suggest that total cost to make just the cells is after material cost and labor with material cost being of that
technology,not_removed,has musk talked about lowering the debt of the united states
technology,not_removed,you are talking to someone who has worked in an intel fabrication plant every time a new chip comes out the ingredients change and the entire plant needs to be replumed there is a cost to this but its only a small part of what it takes to make a chip most of the other equipment just needs to be tweaked setup differently and off you go making cpus again this is a routine well oiled process that is ongoing at every intel cpu plant
technology,not_removed,are you willing to bet against tesla and short them because im not
technology,not_removed,well creating thousands of us jobs should help a little bit and exporting products too
technology,not_removed,here lies the crux of the matter the value of a company has nothing to do with its economical performance and everything with the trust of share holders even if you just read das kapital youd know this shit is a bad idea much less got a proper economical education id be willing to short if i could get a study made released on social media and found by the ais running the market like when pretended steve jobs was dead thats what id have to do and also farm it out to socmed manipulators
technology,not_removed,i doubt instagram is going to be better than youtube for fair use

technology,not_removed,wait did they just invent a tree
technology,not_removed,alright guys tell me why this wont work
technology,not_removed,potentially dumb question does burning the produced fuel do a release of the captured or is it cleaner or dirtier
technology,not_removed,this will disappear i guarantee it
technology,not_removed,the limitation is always the catalyst
technology,not_removed,its about time we make our own trees nature comes along and steals all of our trees we need to build a tree its gonna be a beautiful tree i make the best trees definitely and natures gonna pay for it
technology,not_removed,heres a link to the paper on scihub
technology,not_removed,meter should be tad higher what is the conversion efficiency once we figure the correct power input
technology,not_removed,the bigger thing here could be the type of energy produced not pure electricity which is a bitch to store efficiently but a mix of hydrocarbons which is easy to store efficiently you could already just have a solar cell powering a simple hydrocarbon plant pulling and water from the atomsphere but thats expensive and not efficient if you can make the process all in one then you could build giant cheap farms in the deserts store and pipe the fuel out ready to be shipped round the world
technology,not_removed,even better build a ton of these things in a field somewhere have them produce syngas and then dump the syngas back into the ground
technology,not_removed,it still runs on a pv cell which means that it would be more efficient to just hook the solar cell to a battery than this electrolysis system so unless they build this in the desert far from the electrical grid
technology,not_removed,and this will be in production at a normal affordable cost in years
technology,not_removed,why not use it to make a generatorthe solar cell can burn the hydrocarbons right away to makestore electricity
technology,not_removed,while plants produce fuel in the form of sugar the artificial leaf delivers syngas or synthesis gas a mixture of hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide syngas can be burned directly or converted into diesel or other hydrocarbon fuels so it doesnt turn directly into hydrocarbons then bummer well at least we get hydrogen
technology,not_removed,just keep it away from the oil industry and their lobbyists
technology,not_removed,ive been waiting for this to appear it has seemed inevitable glad to hear it
technology,not_removed,the good news is this could generate fuel using sunlight the bad news is burning hydrocarbon fuels exacerbate global warming theres no free lunch
technology,not_removed,government sponsored research to reduce climate changedone by immigrants lead author is a guy named mohammedmake america great again
technology,not_removed,a tree
technology,not_removed,so it absorbs the carbon so you can burn it which releases the carbon that you just absorbed thats like recycling trash and putting it straight back in the dump i thought the whole point was to stop using fossil fuels in other words burning things how is this a breakthrough technology and a viable option over regular solar
technology,not_removed,which in turn releases greenhouse gas and heat just what the world needs more of
technology,not_removed,its great and all that the cells take out of the atmosphere but shouldnt we work on not burning things for fuel
technology,not_removed,soon well have digital forest fires
technology,not_removed,the article basically said they did but instead of the tree producing sugar this produces a fuel we can use
technology,not_removed,you wouldnt download a tree
technology,not_removed,about time clear out that land in the rainforest to make room for these
technology,not_removed,you wouldnt download a tree
technology,not_removed,and rtrees just went full silicon
technology,not_removed,woodnt you like that
technology,not_removed,one way it wont work its too inefficient the efficiency is around which is quite low this will have to be improved before it can be used at scale
technology,not_removed,a couple of reasons ionic liquids and selenides are prone to oxidation while you can be really careful in excluding oxygen in lab or pilot setups its much harder in real conditions thats why oxide supported noble metals are so far the only industrially developed catalysts they last in real environments while its true that selenides are cheaper than noble metals in a typical catalyst the noble metal content is very low as its supported on very cheap oxides also ionic liquids are expensive the usual production scale argument only partially holds in this case as they are inherently expensive chemicals a couple more considerations efficiency is relatively a factor this wont suck out of air this would be coupled to a relatively pure exhaust like a cement factory to convert a fraction of the feed into still pretty cool though
technology,not_removed,i like how you think
technology,not_removed,it is based on triple junction silicon cells which cost bucks
technology,not_removed,its a net zero which is better than burning fossil fuels which is a net release of into the atmosphere
technology,not_removed,should be carbon neutral just like trees are tree takes in sequesters it for some time dies and releases back again
technology,not_removed,clean carbon in sunlight in carbon out heat out no net carbon gain to the atmosphere cleaner than burning oil because petroleum still has a lot of sulfur contamination even when they remove most of it burning wood is also carbon neutral all the carbon wood released during burning was originally carbon dioxide that was captured by that tree and incorporated into its wood
technology,not_removed,possibly dirtier if its possible to produco carbon monoxide
technology,not_removed,just like those two instances of young brown girl geniuses making second rechargeable batteries wtf happened to them huh gone and this will be too almost time for another kardashian episode to help us forget
technology,not_removed,meter should be tad higher its comparable to my solar panel mine has slightly more than and produces watts
technology,not_removed,i believe the wattssq m is them averaging solar radiation over the whole year so winter and overnight and clouds obviously take a big chunk off the watts of direct sunlight
technology,not_removed,or you could plant a forest for a fraction of the effort and use the resulting fixed carbon wood in a useful way
technology,not_removed,burying carbon doesnt make any sense until we completely stop digging it up it would be better to use this and then use less fossil fuels for the exact same result and greater simplicity
technology,not_removed,if its already in the atmosphere and converted using solar power then the system is carbon neutral
technology,not_removed,why bother when the israeli do a great job of this
technology,not_removed,the normal carbon cycle is not pollution plants take carbon out of the air and then put it back when they burn or rot then they do it again this is quite natural and not a problem this system emulates that it doesnt remove carbon from the air permanently but neither does it add to it
technology,not_removed,way better than fetching new carbon from deep down inside the earth and putting that carbon in the air this method doesnt increse the levels at all
technology,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with burning things for fuel if said burning is carbon neutral
technology,not_removed,my godwho will prevent them
technology,not_removed,controlled burns will be as simple as a defrag
technology,not_removed,they rooted your box
technology,not_removed,digital style
technology,not_removed,now if only they would invent a tree that produces maple syrup we could have waffles
technology,not_removed,wood
technology,not_removed,we can use wood as a fuel
technology,not_removed,what we need is a plant solar panel that will keep multiplying until we have enough then dedicate itself to producing fuel
technology,not_removed,and can be scaled up with less labour doesnt take years to mature and can work in arid conditions or on concrete
technology,not_removed,i would i would download all the trees then i would install them on my roof you think im joking but im not
technology,not_removed,does that matter if it is cheap enough to install at that efficiency
technology,not_removed,still amazing photovoltaic cellssolar panels started out with extremely low efficiencies and look where they are now a single breakthrough like this is all it takes
technology,not_removed,efficiency isnt really the question its whether the cell will produce more value over its lifespan than what it took to build and maintain it its not that efficiency doesnt matter but the costbenefit is whats important
technology,not_removed,sheesh this is always the answer every single time
technology,not_removed,thats still times more efficient than plants
technology,not_removed,so solar cells have been getting increasingly efficient in the last decades might happen with this as well
technology,not_removed,letting sunlight be wasted is efficient
technology,not_removed,technically the in fossil fuels was captured in the same way the difference is only how long the solar energy was stored its all fusion power
technology,not_removed,burning wood is not necessarily carbon neutral a huge portion of the earths carbon is stored in forests burning them would significantly raise the atmospheres level
technology,not_removed,burning wood is also carbon neutral pyrolysis is carbon negative i dont understand why it isnt used more
technology,not_removed,yeah italians in the house
technology,not_removed,this is a valid concern it is carbon neutral in the sense that the same amount of carbon is in the atmosphere from us doing this than as if we burnedmade nothing the form that carbon takes is another matter though i do not see why this would produce more carbon monoxide than fossil fuels as i understand it producing carbon monoxide is most common in a bad furnace that is burning fuel inefficiently and has more to do with having enough oxygen than the type of fuel though that could be wrong it is certainly cleaner in that it doesnt release other contaminants like sulfur that are in fossil fuels
technology,not_removed,i dont like being the conspiracy theorist but it happens all the time
technology,not_removed,we have one its called httpsenwikipediaorgwikirubisco and its the most abundant protein on earth
technology,not_removed,your panel is not efficient
technology,not_removed,forests do fix carbon but not as much as you would hope plus when the wood decomposes it releases the carbon back into the atmosphere you have to keep the wood from ever burning or decomposing to lock away the carbon
technology,not_removed,good point that makes it better than i thought i guess im a bit addled after furiously bailing out inches of water from my basement i hope the power comes back on soon
technology,not_removed,ill agree to the idea of campfires i enjoy the outdoors and log burning fireplaces and the like if the carbon can be trapped at the exit but the whole idea of burning for energy has been ingrained in our psyche by our experiences in the last years this needs to be changed so that energy is no longer associated with the burning of fuel but with the natural production of the climate and the sun i do agree that should perfect no waste nuclear be acheived or that fusion is either nuclear has an important and possibly era altering possibility

technology,not_removed,my chevy gets miles per log
technology,not_removed,hope your roof is sturdy
technology,not_removed,no no i believe you
technology,not_removed,cost efficiency is often the thing that matters most dont know about this case though
technology,not_removed,no but this will be very expensive and it will also require a massive physical footprint to do anything worthwhile
technology,not_removed,absolutely at todays pv silicon prices less than half the total installed cost of a home solar panel is the cost of the actual silicon silicon solar cells have efficiencies of over if you have to install over times the number of panels to get the same amount of electricity you do the cost math these numbers will vary for commercial installations favorably for the cheaper cells but a delta in efficiency is way too big to overcome
technology,not_removed,photovoltaic cellssolar panels started out with extremely low efficiencies and look where they are now yes i think as a society we should look at where they are now they arent on all our roofs they arent well most places there are a few problems legislation there are just enough obstacles and incentives in place that keep it from being a good investment people most people think solar panels are more efficient than they are and assume legislators are willing to go for them activists know better saying most people we need so so so many of them to make a difference in a real meaningful way that if its going to happen each of us should be able to rattle off programs that are helping to get solar panels where they would need to be we would all know how much converting our houses to solar would cost we would know about nearby solar farms going up because theyd be huge and a big deal we would see how business are using solar office parks etc we dont solar hasnt really come yet still waiting you mean efficiencywise how far theyve come and cost per watt i know but its a good jumping off point im a little irritated with solar wind not because i dont like them but because theyre being used as an excuse to invest more in other fossil like natural gasfracking
technology,not_removed,where are they now an expensive novelty that cant begin to power a modern grid
technology,not_removed,the chances of something that was just invented and is novel enough to warrant a paper increasing in efficiency is about if anyone puts much effort into it its a question of who wants to pay for that improvement
technology,not_removed,fine net zero on a human timescale
technology,not_removed,my understanding is that there are a lot of studies making it uncertain if that is true also wood burning is very inefficient and wood smoke is a toxin
technology,not_removed,its not even conspiracy its blatant fact i like reading articles and i distinctively remember two instances of young brown girls making second fully rechargeable batteries and poof gone
technology,not_removed,i think no panel is
technology,not_removed,if only the earth naturally did this
technology,not_removed,on a slightly related note theres an idea first proposed by james lovelock to burn wood in a low oxygen enviroment to maximize carbon rentention the resulting material charcoal is then buried effectively removing carbon from the air if we continously plant new trees while charcoalizing old ones we can make a serious dent in the carbon content of the atmosphere
technology,not_removed,so that sounds like a strange problem to offhandedly mention in a comment also how would power keep your basement from flooding i live in florida and have no idea what basements are like

technology,not_removed,you just live in the wrong place there are parts of australia where there are more houses with rooftop solar than houses without there are some suburbs that generate more power than they use made possible with many government grants and subsidies also the high cost of electricity in australia makes solar more attractive granted australia is noted for being particularly sunny but so are most southern us states the problem aside from lack of funding is that energy in the us is really very cheap and has been for a long time hard to justify the upfront cost of solar when you only pay for electricity
technology,not_removed,solar needs to pass a certain price point before it becomes ubiquitous and it is quite close to it now wind is currently the cheapest power production in many areas where there is a good wind resource solar is a couple of years from there for areas where there is high solar incidence once we pass a certain price point any south facing sloped roof being replaced roofing lasts about years on average becomes an obvious candidate to be replaced by a solar collector material at that stage solars contribution to most countries power generation will skyrocket
technology,not_removed,i ran the math one day on how many panels it would take to continue living comfortably in my sq foot townhouse i keep the thermostat at in summer in winter in arkansas mostly mild winters but the ac is on for almost months straight fridge mini fridge computers monitors external hard drive tvs electric stove washerdryer lights hair dryer sometimes a fanand probably other stuffi dont have a microwave atm solar panels thats just not feasible at my current lifestyle
technology,not_removed,tesla giga factory its possible and can be cost efficient the question is why isnt everyone adapting this
technology,not_removed,its not efficient but we need to start somewhere
technology,not_removed,we also need good energy storage solutions solutions that work at grid scale batteries dont really cut it for this
technology,not_removed,when your feedstock gets turned into solid chunks of carbon that can be used as a soil amendment thats seems carbon negative to me you bury it in solid form and then you can use it to aid growing more carbon that you can eat and pyrolyse the leftovers of and your poo if so inclined combustion and pyrolysis are two different processes the primary issues with pyrolysis are things like tars anything dodgy from the feedstock that survives pyrolysis etc nothing is truly clean theres always some waste product somewhere in the chain efficiency is always a matter of comparison the chief value of gasifiers is that they are low tech and can run on pretty much any feedstock there are clearly downsides to the technology too but that can be said of any
technology,not_removed,im not arguing im just saying that people are going to call both of us conspiracy nuts i even upvoted all your comments
technology,not_removed,if only there would be a naturally abundant chemical that automatically filters itself out using suns radiation and absorbs lots and lots of while its in its liquid form
technology,not_removed,the gas produced from making charcoal is also a usable fuel you can even power a car off of it
technology,not_removed,or just plant trees and then turn them into lumber for homes and furniture sounds pretty carbon negative to me
technology,not_removed,he probably has a sump pump to remove water from his basement but its not running because his power is out
technology,not_removed,he could have a sump pump or they could be unrelated sump pumps have a colection basin for water that leaks into a basement when enough water collects in the basin the electric pump kicks into bail out the water
technology,not_removed,power wont keep it from flooding but helps in the cleanup and dry out we bailed out the water by hand with buckets

technology,not_removed,you just live in the wrong place oh yeah dude i dont deny that there are some suburbs that generate more power than they use made possible with many government grants and subsidies this is what i mean by if solar were working it would be obvious to everyone its working there and its obvious to you its not working here and people assume it is somehow wtf we in the us think were shifting to solar we were sold of renewable by and were not as a people freaked out by how low is or how far away was when they picked it this was years ago they set the bar really very low it feels like were moving at a snails pace and celebrating how awesome we are every once in a while fucking mind boggling im in about as sunny of an area as you can get in the us and i cant think of one residence in the city i live in that has solar i could probably locate one but id have to ask around and theyd be rich to afford it and theyd be environmentalists because who else would lose that much money for this guess how many rich environmentalists there are in the us the main problem is legislation the problem is that oil makes people money and those people are pretty much running the show the way it is now its just not economically feasible on an individual basis its not even a matter of being cheap its considering for solar panels to in batteries i mean if you want to use a good of the power you capture what net metering we have isnt a good enough deal in my area and knowing that youll replace the batteries before you recoup the cost of the batteries and that will never be recouped the problem aside from lack of funding is that energy in the us is really very cheap and has been for a long time i can see how it comes across that way were cheap with things like this flint michigan is the poster child for this attitude its not really about being cheap its about people wanting to get richer i assure you that when it comes to contracts about the right topics other things that make the right people more rich like war were plenty spendy hard to justify the upfront cost of solar when you only pay for electricity fracking for natural gas may have been around for a long time but i dont know it it really seems like it was invented to make us feel like were leaving oilcoal without actually leaving fossil ive probably already said enough keywords to get a paid fracking defender to come in and tell me im wrong im not joking when i say this has happened to me on plenty of occasions
technology,not_removed,wow in germany we pay €
technology,not_removed,solar needs to pass a certain price point before it becomes ubiquitous bingo once it makes economic sense it wont take government to make it happen
technology,not_removed,you dont need to replace all of your demand to make it worth while a better calculation is the payback period how long before the panels pay for themselves and they start producing free power for you even if some is still coming from the grid
technology,not_removed,ive done similar math to similar conclusions i didnt flinch so much at the cost of the panels keep in mind you dont really need from panels from the getgo and thats hard to do anyway since your use in the summer is different than your use in the winter for example plus is an impossible number to figure out since the suns not where it needs to be of the time where i run into the problem is batteries and how long batteries last at that point the math is obvious that solar on my house means im essentially agreeing to replace them every so many years so im basically renting expensive batteries and not only am i saving money im spending quite a bit to keep it going every time i do the math i come to the conclusion that i really wish the grid would act as my battery the programs that exist for net metering have largely been legislated out of usefulness at least in my area and id be surprised to hear anyone elses area is different and frankly batteries are essential cloudy for a week or a rainy month better have a lot most of us wont untie from the grid our demands are just too high i honestly believe the success in us moving to solar depends upon all of us deciding to bite the bullet together and make legislation that causes the grid to act as our battery i say it simply for discussion i know there are lots of implications to this challenges i want us as a society to confront we need to look at this simply though were just not moving to solar were just not if we were wed all know it as it is some people assume we are and thats just not cutting it
technology,not_removed,solar panels probably are not where you should spend you money to be honestlook at the efficiency of your heating and appliances replacing some of them with a rated kit will both save you money and energy at no cost to your lifestyle put some thermostats on individual radiators why heat empty rooms once you have cut your current energy needs it might be more doable to replace some of that generation with solar
technology,not_removed,move to socal and it is i live in about a give or take sq foot house i run everything you run plus a pool got kids so they are constantly running game consoles as well as me standard fridges multiple fans run daily during the summer ac runs from am when it starts to heat up till pm daily i am paying a month in the summer winter
technology,not_removed,thats some serious bullshit
technology,not_removed,most people heat their homes with gas not electric edit also you use a disgusting amount of energy even when i lived with my son and his mother we could have covered our electric usage with one tenth of the number of panels you would need
technology,not_removed,cost efficient compared to what the question is why isnt everyone adapting this its more expensive than other options is why
technology,not_removed,im sad that its newsworthy that one place in the world converted to solar
technology,not_removed,i agree
technology,not_removed,stop with that nonsense how are we supposed to panic people into handing over their wallets and freedom to a world government if people like you keep spouting off truths like that
technology,not_removed,i upvoted you as well my bad if my tone came off as argumentative im actually just agreeing with you because this is happening right in front of us and we seem to be some of the few clicking in and seeing it all of our phones should literally take seconds to charge right now and this breakthrough solar cell gone its scary man

technology,not_removed,no you have to run source binsmokey
technology,not_removed,i live in michigan that said the solar calculators i found years ago showed a year break even while also stating a year average lifespan for solar panels now with federal tax credit its a hair over years but im still looking at an initial cost of id essentailly save on average for the life of the panels if financed the install and thats with federal incentives its getting there but its not there yet
technology,not_removed,man fracking both awesome and horrible awesome because natural gas is so damn useful compared to other fossil fuels just pipe that stuff directly into your house cheapest way to heat up hell get a natural gas grill and never worry about forgetting to get charcoal or propane before a grilling weekend then theres fracking companies that are unscrupulous as fuck and dont follow proper procedures because they want money money money so they pollute water supplies and no one understands and local governments are probably paid off to keep from real oversight from occurring
technology,not_removed,unless you live in the middle of nowhere batteries are not necessary for solar power grid connection and a smart meter is the technology we should be aiming for if you produce more power then you need dump it into the grid if it is a cloudy winter day get your power from the grid it generally needs the power companies to be forced to cooperate but it is definitely doable
technology,not_removed,you dont need batteries to have grid tie in solar which are the vast majority of systems like this
technology,not_removed,i think the best solution would be to use the excess energy to extract hydrogen from water store said hydrogen and then use it in a fuel cell when the sun isnt cooperating
technology,not_removed,omg i am getting ripped off then your bill is for my stuff and its only for summer my last bill was
technology,not_removed,i have adult daughters and grandkids that wander in and out of my house dailyone of my daughters live with me full time plus the ac bill is worse this year because we dont have neighbors my ac has to work twice as hard to stay cool
technology,not_removed,you use a disgusting amount of energy selfrighteous twat much
technology,not_removed,speaking long term paying no electricity bills over years will pay for the installations and after a certain time period youre paying no electricity bills not to mention green
technology,not_removed,we are totally gravy mang you did not come off as anything i just wanted to clarify that i was in total agreement this kind of thing has been showing up for years and years and then the next thing i know poof its gone cant find a thing mentioning it its terrifying how they squash developments like this because theyd destroy the status quo peace mah brotha
technology,not_removed,only su can prevent forest fires
technology,not_removed,environmentally fracking is awful even if it was pulled out of the earth cleanly its still burning carbon my wifes family lost their house because the plumbing was totaled they lived in the country and had well water and were fine for years until a company mining natural gas ruined their plumbing made their water undrinkable replacement cost cost to hook up to city water was astronomically high they had a lawyer that would take the case but after some time the lawyer came back and said heres how its going to go down theyre going to make this extremely expensive for our side if we wish to pursue it and theyre going to say that we cant prove it was their activity that caused this problem thats how theyre operating but like i said even if it were pulled out cleanly its still burning a fossil fuel and im not in denial about climate change and how carbon heats up the atmosphere
technology,not_removed,grid connection and a smart meter is the technology we should be aiming for i agree i said as much elsewhere it generally needs the power companies to be forced to cooperate this is the problem the net metering plans in my area have gotten not better but worse in recent years its going in the wrong direction and in my area worse to the tune of not really an option
technology,not_removed,i dont disagree that its true but the vast majority implies a lot of people are doing it but its such a small community my problem with this is that my community doesnt have net metering they did but it was taken away so choosing an appropriately sized system is difficult for a lot of reasons my power consumption triples in the summer which would be fine because thats when the sunac use is but the rest of the year theres no reason to have enough solar panels to run anything close to the ac during the day and im running all my equipment after the suns gone down i mean its and im still up using electricity
technology,not_removed,ive thought a bunch about this in the past and in conversations like this in other threads excess solar power is so far the only way ive come up with hydrogen storage makes sense mostly people talk about how inefficient storing as hydrogen is but in this case it may really be dealing with an excess of a clean energy so it makes us able to take another look at it
technology,not_removed,plus the ac bill is worse this year because we dont have neighbors my ac has to work twice as hard to stay cool huh
technology,not_removed,wow unconcerned to the point of causing a global catastrophe much this guy uses as much energy in a month as some households in some industrialized nations use in an entire year he should be ashamed of himself
technology,not_removed,paying no electricity bills over years will pay for the installations but the cost for other things go up how long do you think batteries last how much do you think batteries cost when you replace them interesting that the company who thinks its cost effective is a battery company isnt it i encourage you to take a serious look at how much it would cost in your situation and decide for yourself if it were really a good investment you would know many people who have solar panels on their house if you do know many people who have solar panels on their house it may be a good investment where you live if you live in the of the us where its not a good investment you probably dont know anyone whose done it money wise its not there not even in years poor net metering and a high price and frequent replacement of batteries ensures this not to mention green people tend not to
technology,not_removed,there is no mother nature there is no god there is life and death on a big blue marble that does not give a fuck about anyone or anything on top of that the big blue marble is an insignificant spec in a tiny solar system within a smallish galaxy one of an uncountable number of galaxies in the known universe people often ask what happens after you die a lot you are just not around to see it
technology,not_removed,i like you roont should we ever meet up in real life for whatever reason ill buy you a bagel or something
technology,not_removed,httpsyoutubedekyobxxchk
technology,not_removed,omg that got awesome quick
technology,not_removed,yea shit like that is ruining people and it shouldnt be possible if they were fracking right but they arent and are digging too close to where the water is because they are greedy as fuck and of course states dont tax them like they should to support environmental recovery and do the investigation when people have their sell water suspiciously ruined when fracking moves into town as for carbon output certainly its not ideal its better than than most other fossil fuels but non fossil fuel alternatives arent there yet nuclear is the best current bet but people are afraid of meltdowns perhaps in years solar will get good enough to become more prolific but even then we are going to need better battery technology
technology,not_removed,its a common issue part of the problem is that solar has become cheaper so the uptake of net metering has been high there is also an issue that you cant just plug in the equivelent amount of solar to fosil fuel generation and have it just work the economics of the power producers and the design of the power grid also need to be modified to allow this to work they make money selling consumers power and use that to maintain the grid if noone is buying power any more someone has to take over that job our current system will need some major changes to enable this and that will need to be paid for somehow
technology,not_removed,mostly people talk about how inefficient storing as hydrogen is who says this theyre probably talking about high pressure storage in cars and this is mostly a talking point by people irrationally against hydrogen pressurized hydrogen can be formed under pressure only incurring extra cost lower pressurized hydrogen tanks lose less from leakage than than liion does from selfdischarge the problem with hydrogen is pretty much entirely in creating hydrogen gas and in turning it back into electricity turning it into heat is not a problem of course
technology,not_removed,condo or townhouse probably
technology,not_removed,the building is townhouses in a row when i dont have a neighbor that is cooling his side i take on heat from his side i have to keep the closet doors closed cause it gets so hot on their side it will raise my side by degrees
technology,not_removed,global catastrophe selfrighteous and histrionic ill bet youre all kinds of fun at parties should be ashamed of himself thats what some people tell my gay friends or those who smoke unapproved plants etc its none of your goddamned business if he wants to live in a comfortable house you miserable misanthropic guiltpeddling asshole
technology,not_removed,im working through this now on my own home my initial apprehension to solar was the cost and longevity of the power inverter and they have now come up with a fix for that and the parts have year warranties at current electricity costs it will take me years to see a return on my investment and will see a minimum of years of power savings until a malfunction in the system might dip into my wallet assuming the manufacturer is still in business and i still live at the home this involves taking a loan and including the interest in the cost but they say that power prices will continue to increase as they have historically so there will be additional savings in the future i agree there is certainly room for improvement but things are headed in the right direction i feel if return on investments were more in the to year range i think it would be more practical since people do move a lot
technology,not_removed,i accept your gracious offer drop me a line if youre ever in las vegas
technology,not_removed,turning it into heat is not a problem of course the trick is to not turn it all into heat at once

technology,not_removed,selfrighteous and histrionic ill bet youre all kinds of fun at parties and youre obviously blissfully ignorant climate change has caused mass extinctions on earth before and it will again and we will be the cause this time around its none of your goddamned business if he wants to live in a temperature controlled house you guiltpeddling asshole it is my business because his actions affect my life and everyone elses life on this planet
technology,not_removed,great im glad youre finding math that looks suitable or is about where id consider it heavily years and id do it immediately my numbers are much more grim than that maybe ill run them again soon and see if i come to the same conclusions i did are there people in your area who have taken the plunge already i used to worry about hail our year roofs dont make it years but shatter proof panels are pretty impressive now but not all panels are equal here well get baseball sized hail every few years and i imagine being a few years into panels and losing someall so new wrinkles there re insurance etc
technology,not_removed,youre obviously blissfully ignorant thats what the westboro baptist church tells me too see a pattern here go hug a tree and fuck yourself
technology,not_removed,right because theyre known for following science closely s its not the trees im worried about its human beings and youre fucking yourself with your own ignorance so theres nothing i could say that would be a bigger insult than you already are to yourself
technology,not_removed,youre fucking yourself with your own ignorance that sounds just like someone telling me im bound for hell if i dont comply with their demands now fuck off
technology,not_removed,ok antivaxxer whatever you want to believe
technology,not_removed,antivaxxer do you imagine that pulling a random smear out of your ass makes you look clever or something
technology,not_removed,youre obviously antiscience why wouldnt you be an antivaxxer
technology,not_removed,youre obviously antiscience guess again guiltpeddler science is a wonderful thing its why we dont have to freeze in the dark like you want us to
technology,not_removed,like i said antiscience nuclear energy solar and wind with battery storage evs hybrids fueled with lowcarbon fuels efficiency improvements all tools that science has given us to avert climate change without giving up anything in fact our quality of life would improve considerably if we took advantage of those technologies
technology,not_removed,like i said antiscience you need to work on your reading comprehension you mendacious little asshole you tossed off a smear i rejected it you repeated it just like one of l ron hubbards minions would in fact our quality of life would improve considerably if we took advantage of those technologies how about you try advocating technologies instead of bitching at people and pulling baseless insults out of your ass it might make you less of a cunt

technology,not_removed,microsoft edge thats the program that windows keeps popping up and telling me is far superior too chrome right next to all the ads for xbox games in the tiles on the start menu on my work pc for the xbox i dont own
technology,not_removed,looks like they thought this would get fixed i will not make any further comments on exploitability at least not until the bug is fixed the report has too much info on that as it is i really didnt expect this one to miss the deadline worth mentioning that goes public implies there was a human who pulled the trigger it was a bot this bug is subject to a day disclosure deadline if days elapse without a broadly available patch then the bug report will automatically become visible to the public deadline exceeded automatically derestricting
technology,not_removed,microsoft is a billion dollar company and they cant get off their lazy asses and fix this some big wigs better fire some edge staff and replace them
technology,not_removed,but guys didnt you know that microsoft edge is safer than google chrome and safer than firefox
technology,not_removed,this is like the time microsoft has failed to patch their shit one time they even complained that days for critical vulnerabilities was not enough with the following quote todays disclosure by google puts customers at potential risk a microsoft spokesperson said we recommend customers use windows and the microsoft edge browser for the best protection even their best is proven meaningless given this new exploit was left unpatched for days
technology,not_removed,looks like you still have to get around nts control flow guard cfg to exploit it dev wont say whether they found a way to do it if so from my understanding this allows an attacker to use the css exploit to swap control flow to a pointer in memory they control not sure how maybe with a cleverly constructed javascript payload you could then perhaps reverse engineer edges memory space to steal data possibly inject malware etc
technology,not_removed,obligatory what ads i dont see any ads post disclaimer i used windows for a wile and once i started seeing ads to try office for a month i decided that enough was enough people actually pay for this thing this one will not only come up again and again in the notifications area but each time that it does it will make a sound making you think that something actually important has happened shameful microsoft shameful but what i cant figure out is what triggers this thing i ran multiple windows installations at one point and only one started doing this to me why regardless once is enough
technology,not_removed,right next to all the adds for xbox games in the tiles on the start menu on my work pc for the xbox i dont own are you talking about the live tile for the store those are games for pc you can turn the store live tile off and you can also completely unpin it
technology,not_removed,you forgot the s
technology,not_removed,yeah im going to call bullshit and insist that its at least the time microsoft has failed to patch a critical flaw in a reasonable timeframe but thats not really a big deal since most critical vulnerabilities require one hell of a setup to exploit even this referenced issue wasnt reproducible by most of the devs for edge so it would seem microsofts recommendation is the safer alternative despite being a joke that you should upgrade your os to fix a bug i suspect if there were easyreliable means of exploiting the two separate cfg checks that microsoft would have patched it sooner even still days for a behemoth software team to turn around a fix without breaking other shit is a fair request thats why i use on windows vista security through obscurity s
technology,not_removed,to be fair even if scientists discovered a moonsized comet coming to destroy the earth microsoft would still be trotting out that tired old line we recommend customers use windows and the microsoft edge browser for the best protection

technology,not_removed,i couldnt disagree more with this guy while apple products are on the decline its important to note that the reason behind it is saturation theyve already sold millions or billions of iphones apple will continue to sell these products as they remain profitable apple doesnt build hardware or services or software apple sells its ecosystem which is allencompassing sure apple might lose people here and there that have only an iphone but those people who buy in fully remain with apple through thick and thin i myself have become an unknowing apple fanboy without realizing it first i got an ipad then when work gave me a phone i got an iphone i bought my wife an apple tv for her birthday then got her a macbook air without realizing it ive got apple everything why because it all works together seemlessly i have zero reason or ability to ever escape their ecosystem because the transition would be too painful thats why this puff piece is so wrong apple like a black hole has sucked in millions of people that will be a customer for life the broader their offerings the more of their core will buy them up the same cannot be said of samsung lg or any other manufacturer the closest rival is google whos ecosystem stickiness is still nowhere near apple though it is improving

technology,not_removed,so is the displayport also via usbc alternate mode because running both protocols through usbc ports really brings into question why we still use hdmi
technology,not_removed,hdmi via usbc adapter hahahahahaha we want less adapters makes cutting edge next gen device that requires nothing but adapters for the next few years
technology,not_removed,oops radeon pro my bad
technology,not_removed,because most tvs have it and most tvs dont have dpusb cdvi yet probably legacy connector nowdays

technology,not_removed,this article only discusses usage based billing as its currently implemented with fixed rates and insanely low data caps with high overages but why isnt there more talk of fair usagebased billing i would have no problem paying per gigabyte like other utilities power water gas if i was billed for it at actual cost i dont mean paying per gigabyte i mean that it actually costs isps there would still have to be a flat base delivery fee for everyone regardless of usage as there is with every utility for network maintenance id expect something around to be fair and at the high end but with fair billing id think everyone would save on their monthly bills at per gb light users who use only in a month would be billed while the heavy users who use would actually pay morea whopping bringing their monthly bill to assuming a network maintenance fee
technology,not_removed,if they want to continue doing the metered billing they need to be reclassified as a title utility so the meter is fair
technology,not_removed,maybe do not advertise speeds that you can not handle from all connected customers
technology,not_removed,yeah but isps say yes so
technology,not_removed,thats funny the isps are now trying to twist the reason for data caps to be for labor costs what a load of shit one persons usage of over of data doesnt require of labor comcast data caps all while paying a bill not promotion based pricing for they keep crying about how expensive running a company is while rolling in their billions of profits as internet use increases twc techs engineers and executives need to make adjustments such as docsis upgrades at the cable company headend or node splits that divide a shared cable loop in two when bandwidth use hits certain metrics paying all of these people costs money and those costs increase as the network is more heavily used
technology,not_removed,this is a republication of a very interesting article originally published in i didnt read it then so im delighted to see now still very much on point
technology,not_removed,while you are technically correct you are significantly underestimating what a fair usagebased billing would be there are federal taxes etc that are out of the control of isps that would also need to be added in i also believe that the current cost per gb is they also need to make a profit so lets double that and say that theyre going to bill us at per gb lets say youre a heavy user using tb per month download speed of x gb modem rental fee which you can and should avoid base managementdelivery charges taxes assuming a tax rate ymmv the usual bullshit taxes and fees that isps love to backdoor that you cant usually avoid total bill if you rent your modem this is already lower than a significant number of customers are paying now many simply use the internet for facebook and email and will probably use this would lower their bill by roughly bringing them down to those who opt for lower speeds would see their bills drop even further based on the prices between the different tiers of course the problem with this is that well never see isps offering usagebased billing at fair prices they would make sure to jack up the costs per gb so that most people are paying slightly more than theyre paying now and heavy users get bent over and buttfucked and when customers complain theyd blame government regulation or other such nonsense claiming that the that theyd charge is a fair market price
technology,not_removed,bandwidth is not a commodity that you can price per unit it is more like an hotel room or an airplane seat priced offpeak at marginal cost but extremely expensive when there is contention network planning is calculated for a given peak capacity offpeak doesnt matter for pricing too peak demand is all that matters
technology,not_removed,this is what it should be forever more
technology,not_removed,bandwidth is only part if it though how about speed sure you get a cent a gb but if it takes hours to download that gb its not worth it if we have to double meter or tier speed and meter bandwidth things area gonna get much more complicated then other utility meter systems
technology,not_removed,that would cost a fortune and it would almost never happen there should be data capacity to support normal busy hour usage without slowdown the same as old telcos but this is a lot less capacity than everyone running flat out during the peak hour
technology,not_removed,in response to yesterdays house vote to allow internet service providers to sell users browsing data heres an option for throwing grit into the mill
technology,not_removed,my lenovo carbon has had a touch bar for years changes based on the program i am in and customizable dont get me wrong i love apple but man they can repackage shit that has been out for years and have people drooling thats salesmanship right there
technology,not_removed,in general the touch bar shouldnt include controls for tasks such as find select all deselect copy cut paste undo redo new save close print and quit i get that they dont want it to just be a word processors toolbar moved off screen or a panel of function keys thats slightly more expensive to make seems capricious though
technology,not_removed,apple has never been that good at letting people completely configure their interfaces they are continuing in that vein i would love for the touch bar to include alerts as well as be an extension of the keyboard i am very interested to see what developers will come up with
technology,not_removed,this seems entirely fair enough they want the screen be the primary device for visual input and the touch bar to be an input device they are only guidelines
technology,not_removed,sooooo basically any proprietary hardware maker ever
technology,not_removed,razer also had a pretty cool implementation in the trackpad and they put tiny lcds under keys i like approach much much more its about in i first saw it here and really wish this technology progressed faster itll be really cool when this becomes ubiquitous
technology,not_removed,so i took a look at the adaptive keys i have to say its not really in the same class
technology,not_removed,i would have thought that they would have wanted developers to find exciting uses for this rather than just have some programmable buttons
technology,not_removed,no doubt they upped the game a bit they always do but dynamic bars are not new or unique
technology,not_removed,well there you go theres nothing to stop developers of course but apples advice is dont distract users eyes away from the screen
technology,not_removed,a bit is an understatement but apple never really claims they are first to do anything they just pump out great hardware being first to the party isnt much when implementation is slipshod
technology,not_removed,i agree i work with a military system which uses a touch screen panel which is used as a programmable input panel which augments the keyboard and trackball when i first saw their concept i was surprised that they would want to limit it but i should not have been as they always seem to really want to control the user experience even to the detriment of the platform
technology,not_removed,being the first or new to something doesnt say much if its not implemented well
technology,not_removed,theres nothing to stop developers of course not so fast remember by default os x requires all programs to be signed that is a pretty big stick it would be too bad if your developer signing cert no longer worked maybe you should tone down those touch bar colors and get rid of that stock ticker i wouldnt want there to be any delays in the apps store approval process wink wink nudge nudge sinister smile
technology,not_removed,remember by default os x requires all programs to be signed i cant find any cases so far where apple has revoked a developers cert can you
technology,not_removed,nope not yet but i have heard of multiple cases that app store approval took weeks and no reason was communicated
technology,not_removed,and by tears up you mean makes fun of her face
technology,not_removed,amazing my daughter has retinitis pigmentosis which will rob her of her sight by the time she is an adult she is also profoundly deaf we are getting her cochlear implants in a couple of months to allow her to hear and we are hopeful that technology will someday allow her to see her story is here httpsmemoriesforbeccacom
technology,not_removed,he tears up is there another video showing this because the video provided in the article shows nothing of the sort is this a clickbate title or am i wrong if the latter please forgive me for not seeing the part where he tears up if the former please find something else to do with your time and please dont waste ours
technology,not_removed,i call shenanigans read bullshit
technology,not_removed,reported the title is clickbait bullshit and violates rule
technology,not_removed,had a student in the same graduating class with this condition its frustrating in how it robs you
technology,not_removed,the video doesnt show the crying but it was a postinterview the article states it though i didnt post it because of the video that would violate a rule i believe as well the title is straight from the article i didnt change it to be honest i never even noticed the title mentioned crying as a parent to me its a no brainer that they all cried what parent wouldnt in that situation to be its not clickbait or editorialized if a title states the obvious thats my opinion at least
technology,not_removed,this is from the cbc which is one of the major news organizations in canada while no media organization is perfect the cbc is legit in that it has a lot of factchecking
technology,not_removed,for the record the title came straight from the news article i didnt change it and the cbc is one of the major news organization in canada the article does mention they were crying and as a parent myself if my kid was in this situation of course i would tear up that is such a no brainer that any parent or child would would cry in this situation its no different than he title saying that they breathed violate the rule thats ridiculous edit added or child missed that in the original
technology,not_removed,ok cool thanks for replying and explaining your pov cheers

technology,not_removed,youtube comments are vile
technology,not_removed,the new layout will make it easy to navigate and you will not have to scroll down to see the long list of comments
technology,not_removed,as a side comment on this the members of congress who added their signatures to this letter also requested a response back within two weeks of the date of the letter to get responses to their concerns thus a response from the ag should if she responds timely be sent back to the members of congress by thursday november the proposed amendments to rule go into effect unless halted by congressional action on dec eff has httpsnoglobalwarrantsorgtakeaction even if youve already done it httpsnoglobalwarrantsorgtakeaction and mention that members of congress are now concerned about this issue and ask your representative to deal with this issue promptly as well
technology,not_removed,im surprised that as many as members of congress even know what hacking is
technology,not_removed,heres the httpswwwfccgovconsumersguideshowprotectyourselfonline recommending the use of a vpn when connecting to a public wifi if you use public wifi hotspots on a regular basis consider using a virtual private network which will encrypt all transmissions between your device and the internet many companies offer vpns to their employees for work purposes and individuals may subscribe to vpns on their own and the recommending the use of a vpn on public wifi if you regularly access online accounts through wifi hotspots use a virtual private network vpn vpns encrypt traffic between your computer and the internet even on unsecured networks you can get a personal vpn account from a vpn service provider in addition some organizations create vpns to provide secure remote access for their employees whats more vpn options are available for mobile devices they can encrypt information you send through mobile apps connecting to a public wifi without a vpn leaves you wide open to a man in the middle attack its ridiculous that a law would allow local law enforcement to hack you because you took measures to secure your communications on public wifi
technology,not_removed,what is so hard to understand that a persons computer and its contents are no different from other personal property that needs a warrant and probable cause to justify search

technology,not_removed,for defenders of proposed rule amendment unconstitutional surveillance methods and other defenders of government surveillance such as nsa surveillance its easy to figure out their real underlying motivations which arent natsec or security as they claim
technology,not_removed,yep human lives are just a cost of doing business on the government level
technology,not_removed,human lives are the cost of doing business on the corporate level as well dont find solace in a false dichotomy make no mistake the only people that can stop this type of behavior are the citizens of the country that is attempting to kill them
technology,not_removed,i didnt say it doesnt happen at the corporate level that being said i no longer see corporate and government as separate entities they seem to only differ in that corporate gives the order government pulls the trigger
technology,not_removed,agreed ruminating on this it also occurred to me that the administration may be just maybe be a little bit sorry that it proposed and defended these rule amendments which would allow use of general warrants for expanded governmental activities including remote access aka hacking of computers the reason i say this is because this very power they are proposing to give to the fbi creates for example how can the state possibly claim that the fbi shouldnt be able to use a warrant to get whatever it wants on candidates such as clinton and associates regardless of the jurisdiction that the persons or devices are in that they seek under warrant if the administration state actors are essentially doing this to many persons already and if the corporationstate has essentially signed off on this practice im not saying there isnt a fourth amendment problem here there is and i disagree with the proposed rule amendment which will take effect on dec absent congressional or court action im also not suggesting that information about politicians should be kept secret as i think we need to know more about them and in general our society is too secretive what i am suggesting is that there is obvious blowback from the widespread practice of allowing threeletter agencies to do whatever they want perhaps some people in government thought that these practices would only be used against ordinary citizens and now they are finding out that the arguably illegal unconstitutional practices are being used now as well as being proposed to be used under rule as proposed against members of the elite class including electeds and appointeds the elites use these tools against each other as the wars of corporationstates continue
technology,not_removed,rule amendments which would allow use of general warrants cant read your entire screed when you start off with a blatant lie
technology,not_removed,so to be clear the proposed rule amendment which would take effect on dec does allow for what could be described as a general warrant and thus would violate the fourth amendment if it is allowed to go into effect i have no doubt that it will go to court and i would be completely unsurprised if the eff would be the lead plaintiff in the case against the government and it would also be no surprise to me if the case would hinge on fourth amendment issues including case law relating to that a general warrant httpdefinitionsuslegalcomggeneralwarrant a general warrant lacks a sufficiently particularized description of the person or thing to be seized or the place to be searched under the as you can see it today october there are clear limits on warrants that are outside the jurisdiction of the court see the new proposed rule which would take effect on dec wipes away many of those restrictions by adding an entirely new form of warrants for remote access to search electronic storage media as was aptly summed up the doj leaves out that the new rules also effectively wipe out the requirement to give a copy of the warrant to the person whose computers are being hacked yes the new rules require a receipt but they switch to a reasonable efforts standard rather than the current standard which is that they must give it to the person or leave a copy where the property was taken that pretty much guarantees that some of the people who are hacked following this wont even know about it this allows one judge in one jurisdiction to issue a warrant that would allow the fbi for example to invade the privacy of numerous persons devices across state lines and in the process such activities would be conducted without the persons whose devices have been so compromised even being noticed as stated above a general warrant lacks a sufficiently particularized description of the person or thing to be seized or the place to be searched in the case of the proposed amendment to rule this means in five or more districts which means the search could be directed across the entire united states or possibly even beyond that at tens of thousands of innocent persons to say that this does not have the effect of a general warrant is surely to deny reality
technology,not_removed,the proposed rule amendment which would take effect on dec does allow for what could be described as a general warrant and thus would violate the fourth amendment this is wrong a general warrant refers to a warrant providing a lawenforcement officer with broad discretion or authority to search and seize unspecified places or persons a general warrant lacks a sufficiently particularized description of the person or thing to be seized or the place to be searched and the particularity requirement is unchanged by the rule amendment under the existing rule as you can see it today october there are clear limits on warrants that are outside the jurisdiction of the court see the new proposed rule which would take effect on dec wipes away many of those restrictions by adding an entirely new form of warrants for remote access to search electronic storage media as we can see from your own words the update is concerning jurisdiction not particularity you should stop lying you really should stop quoting techdirt because they literally cannot stop lying in the case of the proposed amendment to rule this means in five or more districts which means the search could be directed across the entire united states or possibly even beyond that at tens of thousands of innocent persons this is again not about particularity they will still have to specify the type of data which the warrant is valid for i recently did for a guy who was off on some other false attempt to imagine that this update violates and i suggest you go read some of those cases they illustrate some of the practicalities of computer searches and make it clear that particularity is about functional limits on content not whether they get a lot of data or even if that data belongs to a lot of people or even if a lot of those people are innocent to say that this does not have the effect of a general warrant is surely to deny reality do you think that the supreme court is denying reality given that they are the final arbiters of the contours of the fourth amendment why do you feel confident that you can assert your completely uneducated opinion in place of their approval
technology,not_removed,techdirt isnt lying about rule changes please stop assuming they lie they pointed out that this is a jurisdictional change and the idiot above you just fails to understand anything about that and makes up shit
technology,not_removed,do you think that the supreme court is denying reality given that they are the final arbiters of the contours of the fourth amendment why do you feel confident that you can assert your completely uneducated opinion in place of their approval yes as a matter of fact i do think that the supreme court was denying reality when it approved this rule without comment at the very least the fourth amendment implications of the proposed change are tremendous i cant read their minds but it is possible that the justices gave a collective shrug and simply approved this thing thinking that if congress had an issue with it congress would do something about it before december as per the procedure which by the way guarantees that if congress does nothing this rule will be challenged in the courts not everything the us supreme court does is a decision representative of wisdom and logic it is just the decisions that they make they are who they are i recently did a case search for a guy who was off on some other false attempt to imagine that this update violates and i suggest you go read some of those cases they illustrate some of the practicalities of computer searches and make it clear that particularity is about functional limits on content not whether they get a lot of data or even if that data belongs to a lot of people or even if a lot of those people are innocent edit i did in fact read your comment on the cases you cited from another thread initially i saw no reason to respond to that thread here but i thought it might be beneficial to some readers to provide a brief response to your reference to regarding us v burgess that case dealt with one person and multiple files it seems like it was just not the best case for you to cite i understand how it had bearing on your comments in the thread though regarding us v carey you refer to a circumstance in which the court states with the computers and data in their custody law enforcement officers can generally employ several methods to avoid searching files of the type not identified in the warrant here with the proposed amendment to rule we are talking not about situations in which the computers and data are in the custody of law enforcement that is the remote access provision proposed reasonable effort for service standard proposed multijurisdictional provisions as proposed read tens of thousands or more innocent people potentially harmed at a time as a result and so on regarding us v khanani relevant to this discussion is whether or not the case decided in in the united states court of appealseleventh circuit provides any support for claims that the proposed rule amendment would be necessary i do not think that it does in part for the following reasons in the case background it states in part in november law enforcement agents raided and searched fourteen locations including seven bbw stores two sports dominator stores a bbw corporate officewarehouse the office of maali enterprises maalis residence portlocks office and a storage unit rented by portlock the government seized multiple computer hard drives as well as related equipment and software from the businesses and homes an agent mirrored the computer hard drives after they were seized so that the data contained therein could be reviewed by investigators the search warrants were based on an fbi agents affidavit which alleged that the computers were integral tools of the claimed violations the master affidavit limited the search to specified categories of documents pertaining to a number businesses and four individuals and limited the chronological reach of the search to documents and records dating back to the affidavit also required the search activity to be focused on materials related to specified immigration and tax violations so while there were no doubt automated software processes involved in narrowing down material to be analyzed in us v khanani as you pointed out a computer examiner eliminated files that were unlikely to contain material within the warrants scope the culling process winnowed down the files seized from approximately three million to approximately it didnt involve the use of software across multiple jurisdictions to target innocent persons who in turn could potentially have their property harmed by the use of such software as would likely be accomplished under the proposed rule which would come into effect on dec there is no question that the corporationstate can use software to aid itself in its searches and that the courts have upheld that notion however the circumstances in which the proposed rule amendment suggest that this would occur are extended beyond what have previously been designated as legal which is precisely why they ran it through the process of proposing an amendment to rule in the first place arguments that theres no big deal about this sort of fall flat in addition there is a lot missing to arguments that cite court case after court case suggesting that there is some sort of reasoning that would support the proposed rule when in fact it would be unlikely to hold up under challenge if you are going to read cases on this issue youd simply be better off reading up on cases that involve the protection of privacy and anonymity online and there are various state laws that would make the proposed rule illegal to implement one example is the proposed rule simply fails to meet the warrant standards of californias sb as one example i have no doubt that if this proposed rule amendment is allowed to become effective on dec it will ultimately be challenged in court and will eventually be successfully overturned cheers
technology,not_removed,explicitly the jurisdictional changes to rule only apply when the location of the computer being searched is masked ie using a vpn and the jurisdictional rule change is the only thing in there as it stands now someone engaging in criminal activity on the internet can use a vpn or other technology to mask their location and there is quite literally no means for law enforcement to get a legitimate warrant to search said computer because they dont know what jurisdiction its in are there other rules in our warranting system which are already open to some amount of abuse by law enforcement yes there are does the change to rule make some of them more abuseable yes a bit that doesnt change the fact that there is an absolutely compelling reason for the rule change criminals can stymie the ability of law enforcement to procure and serve a legitimate warrant by simply masking their computers origin theyre not going to go back and revisit the rest of the rules because theyre established law and most of them have been all the way up to the supreme court for good or ill
technology,not_removed,the section he quoted above only mostly lies it definitely doesnt effectively wipe out the requirement it changes the standard yes but its a far cry from wiping it out regardless ive been arguing against rtech on cyber law for many moons now while the articles that get play here are generally of poor quality techdirt stands alone in being consistently atrocious yes including many outright lies if you would like to catch up on the long history that has led to me making this claim httpsredditcommentsearchcom my comment history for the string techdirt im sure theres even an article or two there where they lie specifically about the rule update
technology,not_removed,the rule change is allowing magistrate judges who do not necessarily have any training in computing or computer related case law to issue warrants in the case of unknown jurisdiction rather than the current method of requiring the warrant to be signed by a district judge who specializes in computer related cases this is horrible as a matter of law because judges who shouldnt be handling anything related to these warrants because they dont have specific subject matter knowledge and experience thats going to lead to a lot of bad and overly broad warrants being signed
technology,not_removed,you stated there is quite literally no means for law enforcement to get a legitimate warrant to search said computer as it stands now where someone engaging in criminal activity on the internet is using a vpn or other technology to mask their location you also said that this was at least in part because they dont know what jurisdiction its in this is actually not correct law enforcement today is in fact able to do so and regularly does here is one article which i posted in a different thread that describes the financial and other surveillance provisions passed as part of a previous cromnibus these surveillance provisions were significant and broad though many americans are still unaware that they even exist the information gathered under the surveillance provisions passed and signed into law in december as part of the cromnibus as written wouldnt even require a warrant as of yet noone has challenged this in the courts that i personally know of its possible someone has and the public has been kept from knowing about it too thats happened before as we saw from nicholas merrills of calyx fame case it took him eleven years this is what we are up against folks unaccountable three letter agencies hungry for power ever more ardently scraping away at whats left of our ability to exercise constitutional rights there is no compelling reason for the rule change as proposed this is one of those see you in court points at which people who think its needed and somehow think that everything that the fbi asks must be given to them are just going to have to deal with the fact that well be willing to fight them tooth and nail on it and resist them both in the courts as well as with technological means
technology,not_removed,i agree with you generally but i think youre exaggerating acrosstheboard impossibility a little bit in some cases i think you could glean enough facts from contextual information to sufficiently establish that the computer is located in a certain district notwithstanding use of a vpn for example if a computer is being used to post candid stalking photos of a woman in seattle i think you can reasonably infer that the computer is in western district of washington but yeah youre not usually going to be able to dox someone sufficiently to know what the location of their computer is
technology,not_removed,mike masnick has opposed the change because it will allow magistrate judges with no particular knowledge or experience of computer related case law the ability to sign warrants that they will barely understand the current system of requiring the warrants too be signed by district court judges with specific subject matter knowledge and experience is a system that works because it provides a greater assurance to america that their rights arent being violated if the rule change does go through a lot of bad warrants are going to be signed as magistrate judges will not understand the complexities of the technical and legal matters involved in these hacking cases hes never actually said anything factually inaccurate about this although he does embellish what will happen
technology,not_removed,you are incorrect to state that the section he quoted above is mostly only lies by saying so you state that the techdirt author is lying about the proposed rule and you imply that i am lying through my teeth about it as well indirectly you also are suggesting that something like must not be thinking clearly i am quite certain eff aclu and the many other organizations opposing this rule have legitimate concerns and i support their concerns i am dismayed by what this corporationstate has done in proposing this rule but i am not surprised i will certainly continue to support as a donor the eff and other organizations should they take the us corporationstate to court on this matter to challenge the rule should it become effective on dec
technology,not_removed,mike masnick has opposed the change because it will allow magistrate judges with no particular knowledge or experience of computer related case law the ability to sign warrants that they will barely understand funny they can already do that try again the current system of requiring the warrants too be signed by district court judges with specific subject matter knowledge and experience is a system that works because it provides a greater assurance to america that their rights arent being violated and heres the rub america one that i dont generally dont talk about enough district court judges can already do this no those district court judges dont have to have specific subject matter knowledge i guarantee you that you cannot point to any such requirement for district judges they dont have to be more experienced either magistrates have to be members of the highest bar in their state in fact magistrates only have power through a district judge so theyre still the ultimate assurance to america that their rights arent being violated whats really important about this is that it shows how absurd the outrage is on the substantive matter pick a piece of propaganda any piece of propaganda fbi can get warrant to hack innocent people district judges can already issue these fbi can get a warrant to search property outside of the judges jurisdiction district judges can already issue these literally none of the things that people bitch about are substantive issues because district judges can already do those things if you really believe that there is a massive gap between district judges and magistrate judges in the capability to understand the technical and legal matters in front of them you need to make that argument like with information and stuff right now it looks like you just have a line between districtmagistrate and thats gotta be the line at which they go from understanding to not understanding because otherwise my argument doesnt go through give me a reason to believe that this line actually is where they go from understanding to not understanding
technology,not_removed,im sure they have plenty of dismay to express and im sure that you have concerns the problem is that a lot of those concerns are based on factual errors ive pointed out several to you and you have yet to respond to them or even acknowledge that you were previously drawing conclusions from false information if in light of these factual corrections you would still like to make a substantive argument for why you have the concerns you have i would love to hear it that being said if you say false things im going to point out that the things you said were false im sorry if that hurts your feelings
technology,not_removed,the current method of getting warrants signed for searching remote computers in unknown jurisdictions currently requires that certain district court judges in each circuit be assigned to handle all of those warrant requests these judges in theory due to their higher exposure to these cases have a greater knowledge about the law and technologies involved in this area to better ensure that no rights are unlawfully infringed by allowing any federal judges to sign these warrants you allow the executive branch to shop around for the most technologically illiterate judge that they can find to get their shoddy warrant approved that would never pass muster before one of the judges currently handling these warrants then even if the warrant is thrown out as deficient the government gets to keep the fruits of the poisoned tree so long as the defense cannot show that the government acted in bad faith in their warrant application so yes this is a horrible rule change if the exclusionary rules that we have in place today did not exist and any evidence gathered unlawfully or under a deficient warrant was always excluded then it would not matter because the prosecutors would ensure that their warrants were always able to stand under scrutiny so as to avoid having cases dismissed
technology,not_removed,yes there is a current procedure seven different district courts have pointed this out in the recent child pornography cases the current procedure is that you go to a district judge assigned to warrants under the relevant laws and you get that district judge to sign the warrant a magistrate judge has historically only ever been able to have jurisdictional authority over their local area a district court on the other hand has jurisdiction over the entirety of the united states of america and all of its assets and citizens wherever they might reside this has been true for the last two hundred years the doj wanted this change to allow them to make an end run around the district judges by letting them go to magistrate judges that arent even appointed by the president and approved by congress and it looks like theyre going to get it
technology,not_removed,of the judges currently handling these warrants only one is over the age of which is the retirement age for federal judges of them i know of five who educated themselves or came in educated in computing fields each district currently has judges assigned to handle these cases and it has been working perfectly fine except when the doj made an end run around the requirements to get their child porn server hacking project approved by a magistrate judge when they should have gone to a district court judge and youre right that they dont have jurisdiction over everyone in all cases but in the case where the location of the item to be searched is unknown all district courts have jurisdiction until such time as a more appropriate venue is discovered and thats what rule spells out in detail i think that changing that and handing this power over to magistrate judges is just wrong and will open the process up to even more abuse

technology,not_removed,agreed and we could go back in time forward into scifi into outer space into the microbial world into entire new imaginary dream worlds into refugee camps in africa hopefully it will be done in a way that endows us with empathy with seeing the world through another perspective and not only as a distraction
technology,not_removed,yeah the empathy is definitely so important in what you mentioned and thats exactly how it is learned showing every person firsthand the reality of other humans living in completely different situations time periods etc would really do us well as a species

technology,not_removed,the other thing that is going to kill a lot of adrevenuedriven sites is the hoard of party links they haul into your browser from god knows where some of them take forever to load some wont load properly at all and yet others hang your browser a lot of this stuff is seriously starting to piss me off along with the bandwidth hogging intrusive video crap there appears to be no appreciation from the people responsible for it that they are simply poisoning their own well and they then wonder why so many of us are keen on using adblockers
technology,not_removed,about time that said i never click them and if they make the websites money then i kinda dont have a problem its just obvious to me that they are bullshit links and i wondered why they put them there now i know

technology,not_removed,text from link for those who use adblock since senators richard burr and diane feinstein released their longawaited legislation to address the conflict between encryption software makers and law enforcement last april its made about as much progress as a calculator trying to crack a pgp key the bill which required all crypto tools to offer some way for a warrantholding fbi agent to access encrypted information was roundly reviled by the technology and privacy communities and quickly lost momentum in dc too now the burrfeinstein proposal has received its most definitive rejection yet and this time the call is coming from inside the house on wednesday the house subcommittee on homeland security released a research paper with the findings of its own investigation into the ongoing crypto debate the paper which took into account more than a hundred meetings the researchers had with privacy advocates cryptographers technologists and law enforcement officials doesnt offer a definitive way forward on encryption legislation but it does unequivocally state that no current bills—very clearly including the burrfeinstein effort—represent the right approach to solving the problem any legislative solutions yet proposed come with significant tradeoffs and provide little guarantee of successfully addressing the issue the paper reads lawmakers need to develop a far deeper understanding of this complex issue before they attempt a legislative fix the committees researchers are far from the first to criticize the senate encryption bill privacy advocates were immediately incensed at its heavyhanded approach which was essentially to ban the encryption already present in everything from an iphone to whatsapp to a web browser new america foundation director kevin bankston told wired it was easily the most ludicrous dangerous technically illiterate proposal ive ever seen the white house also held off on any endorsement of the bill giving it little chance of advancing this year but the house homeland security report may signal that congress itself also harbors strong reservations about any law that would restrict widespread encryption technology in fact the committees research report takes an approach to the encryption issue that at times sounds more like the arguments of the privacy community than those posed previously by the government it acknowledges for instance that the depiction of the crypto debate as one of privacy versus security mischaracterizes it that encryption is itself a form of necessary security for everything from smartphones to online retail to medical records thus what we are really dealing with is not so much a question of privacy versus security but a question of security versus security the paper states rather than coming to any definitive conclusion on the crypto debate the report instead calls for a socalled national commission on security and technology challenges to hammer out a more nuanced approach to the issue—the same proposal put forward in a bill late last year from michael mccaul who not so coincidentally chairs the house homeland security committee that commission would in theory allow impacted parties themselves—ie silicon valley cryptographers and the intelligence and law enforcement agents whose surveillance techniques are blocked their encryption—to directly engage one another in an honest and indepth conversation in order to develop the factual foundation needed to support sustainable solutions after years of ongoing debate however that call for more discussion feels like a stalling tactic says susan hennessey a former nsa general counsel and current fellow at the brookings institution its a nice punt by which no one has to take a controversial position she says the challenge is understanding what this commission is going to produce that isnt in this report hennessey argues that congress needs to instead acknowledge that there may be no solution that pleases both sides and that legislators need to grapple with the substantive details of the debate questions like the interpretation of the all writs act that the fbi used to try to compel apple to help bypass the iphones encryption or the technical assistance provision of the wiretap act that could force companies to rewrite their code on behalf of law enforcement these questions will be answered in modest moderate ways she says what we really need is for congress to start engaging on those issues but merely the recognition from congress that it needs to learn more before making any decision on the thorny topic of encryption represents progress says privacyfocused cato institute fellow julian sanchez that may be the most hopeful sign the dangerous thing is to be too ignorant to recognize your own ignorance he says now he says there seems to be willingness to learn rather than an insistence on getting to what they know is the right outcome

technology,not_removed,while i understand the ongoing need to provide cheap lcd screens to the tv and cell phone industry it seems odd to start an lcd plant by when everything seems to be moving toward oled even apple leaks say that oled will likely be used in their next phones and they have a really tight relationship with foxconn although if they are catering to a mid to low end market for these lcd screens it makes more sense i am sure they will continue to to ride the lcd train for probably a decade or more to those market especially since lcd will be the cheaper alternative to oled for quite some time to come i wonder how good the foxconn screens will end up being and if they will become an lcd oem for other bigger brand names

technology,not_removed,something smells funny about this idea
technology,not_removed,i dont care where you are or will be there will always be someone trying to hack in
technology,not_removed,tldr whats emdrive
technology,not_removed,the fact that the paper passed peer review doesnt change the status of the technology i would bet my last dollar that the paper contains a section on potential confounding factors and concludes with more research is necessary to eliminate sources of error and confirm or discredit this technology the effect got dramatically weaker when they took air away so at least part of the initial results were not actual reactionless propulsion lets see more thorough testing before getting excited
technology,not_removed,on remdrive there is a plasma particle physicist who frequently comes in to debunk bad science when he sees it here is a copypaste of when he addressed this articles author lol im the article author i rang roger shawyer up today on the telephone and we had a nice chat no subterfuge going on at all oh great finally an author of one of these articles comes around thank you for showing up i have a few blunt comments i have to say this is not very good science journalism like most journalism that surrounds the emdrive this is usually worse than ordinary science journalism which itself isnt that great in fact ibtimes is some of the worst ive seen i dont say this without reason though please hold back your visceral reflex reaction to that comment and read on i mean this with the utmost seriousness your article as uwyrn said lacks the necessary critical view point which all journalism should have for example did you know white and march have put out a lot unrelated material previously it would have behooved you to look into that since all that material and them along with it are widely regarded as crackpot nonsense by legitimate physicists this should call into question their competence first of all you also take shawyer at his word for everything he says without checking anything for example he states their is some year nda which you could have checked on to see if it at leasts exists maybe through the uk equivalent of a public records request you also have a side bar about how shawyer says the emdrive can be explained through special relativity yet you fail to mention that the purported emdrive effect violates some of the most basic principles in physics eg conservation of momentum newtons laws and so would also violate sr you didnt even bother to ask an actual reputable physicist about it yet you have no problem reporting what random people on nsf claims like its truth but you leave out the fact that very reputable physicists like john baez and sean carroll say the emdrive is nonsense sean carroll said this in a recent reddit ama you can look up the comment if high powered physicists are making these comments shouldnt you ask yourself why and try to find out you also mentioned off hand at the end of the article some dubious theories like mihsc created by me mcculloch who is an oceanographer and lacks training in graduatelevel physics again id point out that john baez has basically labeled mihsc as junk on his blog and i myself have check my submission history and that the only thing mihsc publications demonstrate are the weaknesses in peerreview speaking of peerreview you also mention shawyer got a paper about the emdrive by peerreview but what you failed to mention was that it wasnt a physics journal and the paper was only about future possible applications of the emdrive assuming it worked no actual science in the paper whatsoever you also dont mention that the claim of an upcoming paper by ew is purported to be in a propulsion journal not a physics one why is this important if you dont know you might reconsider your career in science journalism because this is important the emdrive claims to violate some very fundamental principles in physics so youd think that a physics journal is the appropriate place moreover the experiments and standards needed to convincingly demonstrate this would likely only be enforced in a physics journal since its not in a physics journal eg physical review or even nature since the emdrive is supposed to be so revolutionary you can bet anything ew puts out will be substandard relatedly white and march put out a nonsensical theory paper last year and guess where it showed up in an acknowledged crackpot journal along side articles on other crackpot topics like cold fusion so your reporting on this is to be frank substandard you dont critically analyze anything and dont ask reputable physicists about the emdrive to get a better sense of what is and should be going on you just spread internet rumors and take at face value someone who has demonstrated he is a fraud and has had more than a decade to demonstrate his effect for which he failed my advice to you is to first take a couple of basic science courses learn what rigorous experimentation entails especially in physics learn about how proper error analyses are done or at least what they are and see how good science journalism is done be learning from writers over at naturecomnew sciencecom or ieee spectrum because quite honestly the type of article you put out just serves to misinform the public edit particle physicist not plasma
technology,not_removed,as a scientist i love the grandeur of an independent scientist like its an unimpeachable stamp of approval some of the shit thats passed peer review would make your eyes water
technology,not_removed,james lind discovered citrus fruit cured scurvy in it took scientist till to figure out how that worked

technology,not_removed,hires version of the kickass rocket image from the article
technology,not_removed,is no one else bothered that the article wrote nasa as nasa
technology,not_removed,alright so scientists dont work for free if they have set out to do some research taking many months of their time laboratory space and buying equipment they are going to publish their findings some people might think that only positive results merit publishing but that is not true anything that contradicts established norms or which sheds light on a debate being played out by armchair researchers is worth publishing it is very likely that this paper will put to bed the idea that emdrive can be a viable propulsion
technology,not_removed,so do they debunk it or confirm it
technology,not_removed,so no anyone
technology,not_removed,so in unconventional theory here couldnt this thing slowly over a period of time move an object towards the speed of light as long as it has a constant energy source in the vacuum of space and the mitigation of other objects gravitational forces
technology,not_removed,its all fun and games until some tears a hole in the spacetime continuum
technology,not_removed,this is the thing thats like a closed metal box and a lot of people are confused as to why it works right
technology,not_removed,thrust to power ratio of mnkw httpsenwikipediaorgwikitopazsolarfarm has a stated capacity of mw and produces mw on average according to wikipedia the site is and it looks like maybe half of that is actually covered in solar panels mw mnkw n if you made a hoverboard powered by this engine youd need a solar farm to produce enough thrust to hold a fouryearold child edit on the other hand if you have efficient wireless power transmission you could use the same solar farm to lift a threeyearold into low earth orbit high enough to be hit by things in low earth orbit it would take somewhere between and minutes no drag vs atmosphere all the way up thisnbspkillsnbspthenbspchild
technology,not_removed,so much hate in this thread itll work or it wont lets see what the next paper brings seems far better than sitting here being armchair scientists trying to pick everything apart without ever actually getting in the same room as the thing youre all trying to prove how smart you are just stop no one cares
technology,not_removed,passing peer review is a huge deal several labs eagleworks dresden etc have yielded results under increasingly controlled settings with approximately accurate thrust predictions there are still possible variables that could be generating anomalous thrust outside of the rf cavity thruster but those possibilities are increasingly improbable last year i would have guessed there was a chance these tests would pan out now i would say its closer to likely that theyre generating thrust via an unknown force interaction the biggest question is how well this phenomena scales up with improved q even a small increase in thrust efficiency would be huge remember that in space very little continuous thrust can add up to immense speeds over time we could conceivably engineer a fissionfusion reactor that could power a craft to proxima centari within a lifetime if the em drive continues to pan out tldr yes we should be skeptical but this looks increasingly legit and could have mindbending outcomes
technology,not_removed,it is powered by the sheer force of broscience
technology,not_removed,thats what i love about scientific peer review they would love to prove theyre wrong when they cant we all win
technology,not_removed,i love this simply because it shouldnt work and apparently does and that enrages a specific group of people popcorn
technology,not_removed,these test apparatus look like nothing more than a sheet of copper and some lathed aluminium with bolts why hasnt anyone made versions of these with varying widthheight ratio to find correlative measurements i mean i bet anyone could commission one of these thing milledbolted together for about give or take each from a local machine shop by shear luck youd eventually just get one that worked at like thrust the inventor speaks of edit rolls eyes okay the purpose of the above question is one of testing eg to see if it functioned at all therefore a response of because it doesnt work is the tail wagging the dog it seems like millions of dollars are being tossed at testing so my question of why are we doing tests looking for these small scale reactions which are costing a lot of timemoney when we could probably test designs in one year distributed amongst people with a reasonable cap of cost to find the design that either a works or b doesnt and promptly give up and move on let the fringe scientists continue doing whatever they want with it
technology,not_removed,the fundamental idea is both absurd and wrong and the results were absolutely undeniably positive
technology,not_removed,fuck international business times this story is neither international nor business
technology,not_removed,the comments in this thread are a pseudointellectual graveyard
technology,not_removed,i dont get you people youre always yelling science but you all seem to want the drive to fail and fail miserably ive never been so confused from this circle jerk of hate this is literally the most prospective space propulsion technology to come around since the invention of the rocket and you want to see it fail even after passing peer review when before you were saying it will never pass peer review now your coming up with new excuses
technology,not_removed,wtf why the negativity here i dont get it we all love science but in these comments i only read how shitty peer reviewing is its like you people dont want the emdrive to work jesus christ
technology,not_removed,wouldnt the resonating walls of a cavity full of radio frequencies eventually decay over time
technology,not_removed,whats so highly controversial about his technology
technology,not_removed,is there a link where i can read the original paper thats reviewed
technology,not_removed,real question could something like this power land vehicles
technology,not_removed,why is it controversial
technology,not_removed,he is also actively working to test the technology out on unmanned aerial vehicles uav in the hope of creating feasible flying cars wut his drive is supposedly performing at a thrust to power ratio of mnkw isnt it a little too small by a huge margin to fly a car
technology,not_removed,so we have discovered a mass effect drive and dont know how it works mass relay beyond pluto here we come
technology,not_removed,no fucking way this is way cool
technology,not_removed,is the the one everyone on reddit lost their shit over and insisted wasnt real or was that the warp drive one
technology,not_removed,hi its people from earth how did you get here umm we were hoping you could help us figure that out
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,well at some point hopefully it will be considered plausible enough that someone builds a small satellite with the damn thing and shoots it into orbit if it manages to boost the satellite it works
technology,not_removed,feel welcome to join us over on remdrive where we closely track all of the new developments
technology,not_removed,i understand slightly the scepticism but is nasa usually in the business of developing and announcing crackpot science
technology,not_removed,im glad we are getting this figured out sems like it could help advance our space farring ability as a race
technology,not_removed,just build a superconducting version of it and run it for a few hours it wouldnt be so expensive for nasa and it would answer all the questions
technology,not_removed,sweet at mnkw we just need to generate gigawatts about of what the us uses on average and we can generate as much thrust as an falcon
technology,not_removed,i cant wait to finally look back at the history of language and phrasing used over the years as the em drive research chugs along impossible drive but current conventional knowledge of science doesnt allow for this this shit is fake needs more peer review until then stfu its fake okay it got some initial peer review and was also confirmed by those researchers but heres all the reasons in the world that their research was half assed and flawed and cant be trusted still fake shit okay confirmed by nasa that theres definitely some sort of as of yet explainable phenomena and has been even further peer reviewed and still holds up heres all the reasons they could be wrong probably fake shit tho armchair scientists of reddit if you are an your respective expertise and you are not actually working on this research directly please shut the fuck up and simply observe instead of drawing your own damn conclusions have an open mind and face the fact that science always makes new discoveries that lead to a reshaping of our understanding of the laws that govern our reality this means that your assumptions could indeed be wrong and this em drive could indeed work or it might not essentially other than the people directly involved in the research for the em drive armchair scientists on reddit know as much as any other bystander for the time being ergo stfu and observe save your i told you sos for when theyve officially said this is the reason why we were seeing propulsion and the em drive is a flop yall are just as bad as religious zealots with that
technology,not_removed,a reactionless drive the classic sci fi writers would be proud if this can be constructed and works as planned what a discovery goodbye newtons third law hello future
technology,not_removed,this is the one with magnets or something that no one really understands how it actually works right
technology,not_removed,a potentially classic scientist gets ridiculed research pans out changes world story sweet
technology,not_removed,is there a subreddit dedicated to em drive
technology,not_removed,i cant decide if im excited or confused
technology,not_removed,thus web site is distributing malware
technology,not_removed,just the title make feel stupid
technology,not_removed,so when do we get the kearnyfuchida jump drive and warp speed
technology,not_removed,can we get an
technology,not_removed,will we be able to read this paper
technology,not_removed,alright wheres my ftlhyperslipspace drive
technology,not_removed,this is coinciding nicely with setis discovery soon well be blasting off to meet the aliens in our emdrive powered spaceships
technology,not_removed,for the uninformed httpwwwdigitaltrendscomcooltechemdrivenewsrumors
technology,not_removed,could the thing generate a torque rather than thrust internally something could act as a gyroscope
technology,not_removed,what are the implications if this emdrive is found to be useful for its intended purpose
technology,not_removed,does this emdrive only work in space i really wish we would crack ssto and make space travel much more cost effective
technology,not_removed,the key piece of information is is the effect greater than standard error of the measuring device
technology,not_removed,i have yet to actually see a copy of any sort of paper published on the emdrive or shawyers thruster or whatever they bloody well want to call this vaporware if they had something like this there should be some cluster of papers being generated by the various scientists producing this but i cant find a harold white in pubspace or on arxiv so im just going to call bs on this and i was going to leave it at that but then i actually read again dr josé rodal posted on the nasa spaceflight forum – in a nowdeleted comment – that the new paper will be entitled measurement of impulsive thrust from a closed radio frequency cavity in vacuum and is authored by harold white paul march lawrence vera sylvester brady and bailey wtf
technology,not_removed,tldr
technology,not_removed,essentially anything that currently flies or drives or floats can use emdrive technology hoverboards and cars here we come
technology,not_removed,was ridiculed and even accused of fraud by some in the international space community invention is the ability to persevere in the face of ridicule and august dogma
technology,not_removed,so were going to get
technology,not_removed,its the httpsenwikipediaorgwikialcubierredrive no no austin i cant back that up
technology,not_removed,quantum mechanics continued to have significant developmentments for decades after that we found the higgs boson recently the different forces of qm had to be unified under consistent theory guage theory was constructed by yang and mills in the which now forms the basis of the standard model we havent even unified gr and qm yet which is what a lot of focus is currently on
technology,not_removed,did any of you read the article every time i try to read it is get one of thosegoogle warning scams
technology,not_removed,cant fucking read the article at all i get so many ads and ad pages to the point that i cant even back browse
technology,not_removed,im withholding judgement until they put one in space and actually see the acceleration
technology,not_removed,i get thatbut not only are you assuming that the conversation of energy is nonbinding now you have to assume this interaction is uneven it piles up and up trying to defend the indefensible and your defense of why we should even entertain this drive seems flawed if this drive is working then infinite energy and speed and mass is possiblewhich is a stupid thing to believe
technology,not_removed,heat energy always travels into an area of less heat lower energy assuming that this carries down to the subatomic scale couldnt each end have lesser or greater energy heat the end with the greater heat would be pulled towards the end with lessor heat energy im not talking true heat instead an energy caused by the bouncing microwaves source works in automotive air conditioning
technology,not_removed,told you it was real
technology,not_removed,my favorite part about all the controversy in this thread is that nature doesnt care what we think what is possible is possible and what is not is not
technology,not_removed,holy fuck this is big tonnes of thrust with no fuel ok electricity required but that makes a big difference and capable of operating within the atmosphere its only limited by its power supply constant thrust would mean very high speeds a significant percentage of he speed of light i presume that puts the solar system within human reach soon and robotic probes to the nearest stars within decades
technology,not_removed,the fact that it passes peer review is very significant now the venture capital will start to flow improvements will come quickly the now tiny thrust should become obvious in the improved versions
technology,not_removed,so when are they going to send one of these to space to see if it really works i mean that would be the best test right just put a separate satellite on the next rocket going up that contains just an emdrive and a way to communicate with earth
technology,not_removed,is this the alcubierre drive or something different if it is that would be amazing
technology,not_removed,obviously the microwave energy is absorbed uniformly but projected in a directed fashion the microwaves are accelerating dark matter therefore in the direction the microwaves are emitted prior to being randomly distributed producing thrust in the opposite direction the dark matter being dark matter doesnt physically interact with the container its a dark matter ion engine sort of simple optimizations would include microwaves travelling down a long waveguide before striking a reflector that reflects the microwave energy to degrees from the thrust distributed evenly across an axis or around a point to prevent side thrust at the reflector
technology,not_removed,all we have here is an unsubstantiated report that some guy who supposedly is part of a team doing peer review on a paper said theyre going to say the paper passes peer review so i dont know whos making up stories about it kinda workingyou shouldnt trust the claims of the papers writers who may only be trolling for funding that is a thing company needs money so they announce some inexplicable new technology people go apeshit and throw money at them then you never hear anything come of it and the technology turns out to be totally imaginary if you guys live long enough maybe youll learn to stop getting excited about unproven technologies especially ones that dont even meet the standards of theoretical science just wake me up when something of substance actually happens for real
technology,not_removed,just a curious reader with no education in this field here ive questions what would this look like as in visually ie fire particulates would this be on a small scale able to powerpropel a hoverboard
technology,not_removed,and the other
technology,not_removed,they call him a mad scientist but his invention can lift a stick of butter and entire feet using only one point twenty one gigawatts
technology,not_removed,and why would they not name it something like hyperspace or warp speed
technology,not_removed,almost no one here knows what this means but they upvote it anyway because science
technology,not_removed,microwave oven that produces thrust
technology,not_removed,its essentially just a metal cone that you bounce microwaves around in the inventor claims that the bouncing microwaves transfer more momentum to one end then the other so there is a net force on the cone everyone agreed that this breaks newtons third law apart from the inventor who says it doesnt break any laws because quantum physics even though he cant prove it somehow this thing works nobody knows why but we are eliminating possible errors to prove if it works the reason this would be a very very big deal for space flight is that currently you can only propel yourself by throwing fuel the other way once you run out of fuel you are dead in the water if the emdrive works we can use solar panels or a nuclear reactor to power it and continuously accelerate
technology,not_removed,its an experimental engine with no propellant critics say it doesnt work because that would violate the laws of physics proponents say yeah but it kinda seems to work critics say there must be some confounding variables you need to compensate for everything imaginable proponents say so far it still kinda seems to work critics say the propulsion is weak and its probably just noise proponents say perhaps but it still kinda seems to work etc so to summarize q does it work a it cant its not possible it would violate every law of physics it kinda does not much not really not superduper good but it kinda does q how does it work a if we knew that the critics wouldnt keep talking speculation is wild so far the proponents just say not really sure have a few ideas all i know is that it kinda seems to work
technology,not_removed,they power celestial beings gundams
technology,not_removed,imagine an orgasm where there was no oh my god im past the point of no return and no convulsions later theres cum everywhere but despite that cum still came flying out of your cock soaking the wall in front of you youd be like wow what the fuck how did that even happen thats the emdrive
technology,not_removed,solid state propulsion
technology,not_removed,something that appears to break newtons third law basically every action has an equal and opposite reaction normal rockets work like a fire extinguisher and an office chair the water goes backwards and the chair goes forwards with this drive they cant work out what is going backwards they just pump in a whole bunch of power and it goes forwards personally this is the most interesting things since hawking radiation
technology,not_removed,well thats an easy bet because any worthwhile research paper should include some variation of those words its just bad research if you dont have a section on possible sources of error
technology,not_removed,wish theyd just send up a small satellite with a spscex payload and see what happens in space if anything and be done with it
technology,not_removed,hijacking this comment to point out httpemdrivecom it containts tehnical reports and documents released this month note documents and reports date from july to august it answers some questions presented here
technology,not_removed,i am excited one attempt at replication and a peer reviewed article means more attempts at replication more actual science to be done the process is working as it should more testing excites real scientists and glados
technology,not_removed,if you dont know how it works it doesnt mean that it doesnt work
technology,not_removed,nope lets splatter this all over the front page and make sure it gets picked up by every cut rate science blog and repeated with click bait titles like nasa develops ufo propulsion
technology,not_removed,the fact that the paper passed peer review doesnt change the status of the technology most importantly we dont know any of the content of it maybe the paper is a whole lot of we were wrong and here is why
technology,not_removed,took air away as i remember nasa tested it in vacuum chamber at least the first time
technology,not_removed,why on earth did they test a space propulsion drive in air
technology,not_removed,i dont get you people youre always yelling science but you all seem to want to see the drive fail and fail miserably ive never been so confused from this circle jerk of hate this is literally the most prospective space propulsion technology to come around since the invention of the rocket and you want to see it fail even after passing peer review when before you were saying it will never pass peer review now your coming up with new excuses i dont care what laws if any its breaking i dont care if its using unicorn farts to some how propel itself let this thing just work
technology,not_removed,wow get absolutely rekt
technology,not_removed,i agree with him the physicist that being said hes invested so balls deep into the drive failing that i doubt hed change is mind if it did work
technology,not_removed,all of that yelling and gobs of text to basically call people crackpots without much science at all literally it is the geek equivalent of a child screaming no youre dumb he also is yelling that people are ignoring science of the drive maybe thats because we still dont fully understand why it can work outside of some theories when current science fails all you have are crackpot theories and educated guesses and there are theories but they require major exceptions to current physics photons can have inertial mass inside the cavity the speed of light changes thats a huge deal but we cant ignore that different research groups across numerous countries have replicated the results either so either every physicist involved has bungled it the same way or something is going on this is still in the basic research phases its ok for a scientist to say wow thats weird in fact its how most of our great discoveries have come about just because someone is an expert in their field doesnt mean they cant be a knob too
technology,not_removed,in an acknowledged crackpot journal along side articles on other crackpot topics like cold fusion instantly had a fantasy about a sequel to httpsenwikipediaorgwikithesaintfilm but this time about emdrive instead of cold fusion an aged val kilmer is hired to steal the secret of the emdrive™ from shawyer only to fall in love and help shawyer escape the evil militaryindustrialcomplex fat cats who put out the hit in the first place
technology,not_removed,he didnt debunk anything here he just complains about the writing of the article not the em drive itself
technology,not_removed,holy shit that dudes going to need to spend a year in a hyperbaric chamber for that burn
technology,not_removed,faraday endured the same treatment by some of the leading physicists and it turned out he was right faraday suffered harsh reaction due to his limited mathematical understanding but eventually through persistant experimentation blasted through the naysayers many scientists live on documented and time tested knowledge so when something comes up that appears to break physical laws of course they will all deny its relevance this is fringe science that physicists refuse to discuss if we stop experimenting to break or circumvent the known laws our progress will slow to a crawl
technology,not_removed,it seems to have made the ftcs eyes water
technology,not_removed,this also means that we can begin to make use of something centuries before we can understand the mechanics of it hell weve been growing crops for millennia before we understood how photosynthesis worked
technology,not_removed,all of the laws of biology didnt say it couldnt work its not at all the same
technology,not_removed,samuel hahnemann created homeopathy in scientists are still trying to figure out how to convince people that it is a pseudoscience
technology,not_removed,james lind discovered citrus fruit cured scurvy in but that shit actually worked you could show people that it worked the results were absolutely undeniably positive the exact mechanism by which it worked didnt matter as long as it worked until someone can make that microwave oven fly or at least show on paper why it should fly and not just show us some tiny and statistically insignificant blips in measurements its not worth our attention if they make that microwave oven fly without using propellants etc sure throw billions of dollars at the project
technology,not_removed,i have some news we aint livin in anymore even more its not that the team experimented under isolated conditions and cam out with unexplainable data they obtained the datas in polluted environment and all of them can be explained with mere interferences so until the team refuses to operate in an isolated vacuum youre comparing apples to oranges or ignorance of the vitamins role in the body to a fishy snakeoil like kind of baseless speculation
technology,not_removed,ublock got things from the website i am really glad that i am on a chrome book otherwise i would need to wipe my hard drives
technology,not_removed,this needs to be higher up this link us fucked
technology,not_removed,ive seen event horizon we need to develop a gellar field asap before we start messing around with possible warp travel
technology,not_removed,the drive doesnt seem to follow physics as we currently understand them if it in fact works it basically renders our current models for physics incorrect and likewise our current physics models say this drive is impossible
technology,not_removed,because if it actually works it will change our understanding of physics significantly the drives invention and the theory behind it were performed by someone outside the normal physics community the theory given by the inventor is apparently a bunch of scientific sounding gibberish rather than an actual testable theory nonetheless the drive seems to work at this point this scares the hell out of a lot of physicists who are emotionally unable to accept that progress might come from outside the methods and organizations to which they have dedicated their lives
technology,not_removed,were put robots on mars on a comet in orbit of jupiter cars are driving themselves human augmentation is on the cusp of replacing the fine dexterity of the human hand and precision of vision weve seen stars die weve seen stars eaten by black holes weve found an earthlike planet around another star theres nothing in the past year of actual scientific achievement to catch your eye
technology,not_removed,if it is between this and the possible radio signal from nearby star that has also been in the news this week id vote for the radio signal i really want to contact another intelligent race in my lifetime even if contact is just knowing that they exist
technology,not_removed,and yet you live surrounded by real mind blowing scientific breakthroughs daily you live like a king but bemoan being a pauper
technology,not_removed,no that is just a british thing
technology,not_removed,i think its a uk vs us english difference but im not sure for instance i think that the north atlantic treaty organization is abbreviated nato is us english but nato in uk english edit basically it looks like british english writes acronyms that are pronounced as words like proper nouns thus nato and scuba but usa and uk
technology,not_removed,it is very likely that this paper will put to bed the idea that emdrive can be a viable propulsion wait didnt it confirm the original findings shouldnt that mean emdrive is a viable propulsion concept even if it has very low efficiency right now
technology,not_removed,neither it is still all up for grabs given how these things usually work out itll likely turn out to be not what is being claimed source been around a while
technology,not_removed,some guy say that a peer reviewed paper has been accepted then he deleted his message but didnt say the result other guys or gals have read somewhere unspecified some text speaking about of thrust but the article is not really clear if this comes from the deleted message and there is some speculation that this could come from the future abstract of the paper the situation is clear not but lets discuss this paper now we may be disappointed once its released
technology,not_removed,its a closed container containing a microwave emitter like your microwave but designed to bounce around the waves in a pattern that supposedly creates an imbalance in force in a particular direction it does work but nobody knows why the designer says that it pushes against supposed quantum foam but his papers dont make sense to most physicists so either the experiment is flawed and the instruments are pushing against a magnetic field of the earth or something or it really works and we are a decade away from true starships
technology,not_removed,yes it could in fact thats pretty much the whole point at least with respect to space travel not that youd want to get up to relativistic velocities within the solar system but lesser speeds would still greatly shorten the travel time to places like mars for instance like several weeks instead of two years or so also if you accelerate the ship at a constant one gravity well there goes one of the real problems with space travel the deterioration of the human body in zero gravity
technology,not_removed,yes if it works and if we take your hypothesis as long as it has a constant energy source in the vacuum of space this hypothesis is not easy close to a star you can use solar panels sure but if you accelerate always in the same direction you will leave the proximity of that star at some point you could embark this constant energy source but in that case you are back to the problem of having to take your fuel with you
technology,not_removed,yes if it works so the problem with interstellar travel is twofold you need to carry enough reaction mass to get up to speed and then to slow down again going very fast means a lot of reaction mass which means a lot of mass which means even more reaction mass to move the other reaction mass once you get going very fast your reaction mass may not be exiting your craft with enough velocity to make you go faster this really only becomes a factor with most propulsion systems when you get to very large fractions of light speed a reactionless drive such as the one referenced ideally solves both of these problems one in that usually the devices are purported to work with em radiation so that means is not an issue you could theoretically get to of light speed is also not an issue with reactionless drives such as the one referenced because they require no reaction mass all you need to have is electricity usually since you can generate a large amount of energy from a small amount of mass therefore you can go very fast with a relatively small ship unfortunately reactionless drives such as the one referenced here break a lot of very fundamental laws and rules that we understand about physics thats not to say that were not possibly wrong on our understanding of these fundamental laws and rules but since these laws and rules have been tested and retested time and time again over the centuries we believe them to be correct so if someone wants to say that they are wrong the bar for proving that is very high however because a reactionless drive would open the stars to humanity the idea that we could have one makes a lot of people forget about the scientific process and rigorous testing and proof
technology,not_removed,in theory if we know how it works we could build a better one the thing making the rounds right now is a prototype built by a guy that only suspects what might be going on inside it
technology,not_removed,it wouldnt make a hoverboard but it would be useful for space flight like an ion engine that only needs sunlight
technology,not_removed,its also worth pointing out that the first mass produced internal combustion engine was and weighed several hundred pounds and at the time the mechanisms of it were fairly well known the how or why of qthursters is still a mystery to everyone at this point its not far fetched to think that once the science is understood the technology will rapidly improve imagine this the model t had a hp engine the first chevy bel air had a engine and by it was topping so in the span of years without any of the modern simulation technology there was a improvement in car engines i would imagine that going from no idea whats happening to an optimised version would yield a larger change than that
technology,not_removed,why the fuck did you switch from km² to mile² it makes your entire point moot because im too lazy to do the conversion
technology,not_removed,i want it to work because it would be amazing and revolutionize space travel but if the authors are playing fast and loose with their experimental variables it kind of poisons the well
technology,not_removed,itll work or it wont kind of like winning the lottery right one of those options is vastly more probable than the other
technology,not_removed,rtechnology should be a place where smart people discus new technology what you want is an uncritical circle jerk thanks for asking us to lower the standards
technology,not_removed,if this does actually work what would make it be so revolutionary as a propulsion device from what i understand it only produces a very small amount of thrust does it use less energy or something extremely efficient
technology,not_removed,actually no it doesnt httpemdrivecomfaqhtml
technology,not_removed,the results were absolutely undeniably positive this is quite wrong the results were marginally slightly positive and the paper reflects that were still at a level of force far less than you could exert with your smallest finger absolutely undeniably positive is when you have things flying around the room tiny changes on a complex meter in the fourth decimal place is nowhere near absolutely undeniably positive this is already interesting and at the point where any solution is going to reveal at least something about engineering but were several orders of magnitude away from absolutely undeniably positive and its extremely likely that in the event it will turn out to be nothing huge
technology,not_removed,even the times were wrong
technology,not_removed,on the contrary if the drive proves out and someone figures out how it works the stars become our oyster the ibt would have to rename itself the interstellar business times
technology,not_removed,but muh ftl drive
technology,not_removed,youre always yelling science you want to see it fail no trying to disprove an idea doesnt mean you want it to fail it is how science works good scientists look for reasons why they might be wrong
technology,not_removed,its too good to be true this would literally be the next stage in space exploration and its healthy to be very skeptical of these claims especially since the thrust decreased significantly once they went to a better vacuum
technology,not_removed,i think a lot of people have their beliefs bound up in this idea that our science today is objective fact that progress in the future will be cumulative and incorporate our current knowledge without overthrowing it basically they hope the science of today will age better than the science of the past if you are into trans humanism or atheism of the scientific variety you have a lot of your identity tied up in the best science of today being correct not to say this paper would say one thing or another just explaining why many scientific minded people have an emotional reaction to this kind of stuff
technology,not_removed,liking science doesnt mean accepting everything you hear science requires scepticism scepticism is warranted because this finding would require fundamental laws of nature to be reshaped and the effects that have been found are minute to the point where they could be within the margin of error you say that it passed peer review as if it is binary you either pass it or fail it it isnt that simple peer review doesnt make something true or false it just provides more than one perspective there is a lot more research necessary into this if this effect can be replicated under stricter conditions then i am sure people would be willing to accept it
technology,not_removed,ive never been so confused from this circle jerk of hate my theory is that you arent in fact a scientist or even a technical person that you cant solve a differential equation or make a mathematical model no insult intended but the thing is you arent going to find one actual scientist here whos not going to be in what you call a circle jerk of hate and what i call professional realism im in the circle of naysayers i desperately desperately want this to be true but i am a realist the chances of it really disobeying the law of conservation of momentum are incredibly tiny we have over three hundred years of experience with this law more it underpins so many fields of engineering and technology from aviation to construction mathematically emmy noether proved that a conservation law corresponds to a fundamental symmetry of the universe if momentum were not conserved everything we knew about motion and dynamics would be wrong and yet somehow it works perfectly the last time such a revolution happened was over a century ago with relativity and separately with quantum mechanics but more those involved conditions never seen in daytoday life extremely high speeds or extremely high gravitational fields or subatomic scales unlike the current anomaly why didnt we experience relativistic phenomena before because you never traveled at a significant fraction of the speed of light now sure it is conceivable that weve been working with profoundly broken physics for three centuries and just happened to get really good results but its very very very unlikely its far more likely that this is either an outright error or that its known physics operating in an interesting way the result of that might lead to interesting engineering but it isnt going to lead to reactionless drives zipping us around the solar system it might lead to a better ion drive but ion drives arent new physic theyre fairly old technology we will see id love to be proven wrong im simply realistic because of decades of experience anything is possible i simply have every rational reason to believe that the possibility that this is breaking the law of conservation of momentum is incredibly small
technology,not_removed,they are claiming the physics equivalent of they arent mavericks getting unduly shafted by everyone the fundamental idea is both absurd and wrong and deserves the negative press
technology,not_removed,because skepticism is the correct approach extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence we have some evidence and we need a lot more many tests is good but them not being peer reviewed is bad most tests showing that there were errors in the test that reduced the thrust is bad but it not going away is good this is the first peer review its good we need more
technology,not_removed,glad im not the only one to notice that here its common everywhere i think distrust for new things is in our nature or something people here dont realize its not like the movies in space currently we cant do too terribly much in terms of movement without hitching a ride on gravitational pulls if we could actually generate efficient thrust in space well be able to have colonies on mars and the moon in our lifetime but dont worry some angry something on here will show up to say itll never happen and why i bet it was like that in every regard for every invention before our lifetimes
technology,not_removed,wtf why the negativity here i dont get it extraordinary claims require extraordinary proofs if it were really shown that this broke the law of conservation of momentum wed have to rewrite all of physics it wouldnt be a minor change wed have to explain why everything seemed to work for three centuries but was actually completely wrong it would mean mathematically that we lost a symmetry of the universe and this isnt a gross result its a marginal result near the limits of our ability to measure and its being hyped by all sorts of media who have little or no understanding of science if youre an older person involved with science youve seen this sort of thing over and over again people are always appearing with small anomalies in experiments most of them are just mistakes a minority reveal a new detail of existing physics very very occasionally we get new physics the last time we actually discovered a conservation law was wrong was httpsenwikipediaorgwikicpviolation more this was a violation of a conservation law wed only observed twenty years before and even more of a result sufficiently marginal that itd still take the resources of a decent university to demonstrate and that has had precisely zero application if this result really broke the law of conservation of momentum everything weve known about dynamics for years and change would be wrong wed not only have to come up with a brandnew physics wed have to explain why the old one seemed to work perfectly for so very long so any working scientist will logically believe that the chances that this is going to be a result that will completely overturn three hundred years of physics are extremely small particularly since this is as of now a very marginal result do remember its not like we have microwave ovens flying all over the solar system what we have is a complex experiment which seems to demonstrate a tiny bit of force thats far less than you could exert with your little finger its so tiny that any number of phenomenon could be responsible though the investigators have tried to rule them out dont get me wrong more investigation is needed the result is sufficiently persistent that it demands an explanation indeed i think it fairly likely that well get potential new engineering techniques out of it and well learn something about science edge cases are always exciting but the chances that this actually breaks the law of conservation of momentum are incredibly tiny you cant rule it out science must be falsifiable and new information could always refute what we think we know but its a huge long shot and watching everyone getting superexcited as the media whips them up when its a near certainty theyll be disappointed tends to me science people cynical and cranky
technology,not_removed,it appears to violate conservation of momentum
technology,not_removed,at i dont think there is any land vehicle that could use something like this thats really a lot of power for a ridiculous small amount of thrust
technology,not_removed,because if it works it would break the most fundamental principle of laws of physics being independent from chosing the zero coordinates known as momentum conservation law
technology,not_removed,he was saying he could get way more thrust out of the second version
technology,not_removed,nobody needs acceleration is enough
technology,not_removed,why do you need to generate that much thrust once youre in space ion thruster craft work quite happily with millinewtons of thrust
technology,not_removed,have an open mind and face the fact that science always makes new discoveries that lead to a reshaping of our understanding of the laws that govern our reality please dont lecture people with that attitude yall are just as bad as religious zealots with that you have a serious superior attitude about science and yet ill bet you cant even solve a differential equation funny how those two often go together this result claims to break a conservation law thats over three hundred years old and conservation laws arent an accident emmy noether proved mathematically that a conservation law corresponds to an observable symmetry of the universe we have literally three centuries of experimental and theoretical work on this matter if this is wrong it wont be a quick fix up well have to rewrite all of science well have to explain why we got such excellent results until now when everything we knew was wrong yes its conceivable science is always falsifiable a strong new result and wed have to throw everything away and restart in this case with two dodgy principal investigators and an effect so marginal it shows up only in the third decimal place a rational person would bet on this being some effect involving convention physics rather than the last three centuries of physics being wrong but you seem sure so lets make a bet ill give you two to one that when this is all resolved the law of conservation of momentum will remain unbroken if two to one isnt good enough make me a counteroffer you seem so very sure that there has to be some odds that will lead you to make such a bet
technology,not_removed,goodbye newtons third law maybe there are a number of hypotheses that it does have some kind of exhaust one where its bouncing off virtual particles one where its sending microwaves out the back
technology,not_removed,try remdrive
technology,not_removed,even seti is saying that it is extremely unlikely that the signal announced is actually a signal
technology,not_removed,i suppose you could mount the thing on the end of a drive shift if you wanted torque but we already have electric motors that work very well so why would you want that
technology,not_removed,yeah basically you will be able to hover and propel anything proper em drive technology allows us to build huge spaceships or stations and slowly make them float to space that is if the em drive is functional
technology,not_removed,its not so much the amount of thrust but the fact that it does allegedly produce thrust in the first place its incredibly energy inefficient but it uses no fuel in open space where acceleration is a nonissue due to low gravitational forces a really really slow engine that uses no fuel is often more desirable than a typical liquid fuel engine atmospheric launches will still require fuelpowered engines to overcome gravity and get you to orbit
technology,not_removed,elon musk send one of these into space now
technology,not_removed,x to the c exactly i mean unless the technology is so big that it cant be transported to space effectively just send that shit up and see if it flies lets have a little less conversation a little more action meanwhile some dude is playing guitar on the iss lets see some real science
technology,not_removed,no it would be an extremely expensive and unnecessary test its cheaper and more effective to develop and refine the technology here on earth before deploying it into space the first em drive in space will likely be used on a satellite or probe that serves some useful purpose other than testing the drive
technology,not_removed,nope completely different and with even less theoretical basis
technology,not_removed,do you have sources for any of those claims
technology,not_removed,what would this look like as in visually nothing its a closed bell shape with microwaves bouncing around inside perhaps an extremely powerful one would glow a bit from heating the metal making it look like a redhot bell would this be on a small scale able to powerpropel a hoverboard probably not the thrust generated is extremely small so youd need an unreasonably huge amount of power to move something in earths gravity well if it works it might be possible to find a way to make it stronger though thats a hypothetical situation inside a hypothetical situation though
technology,not_removed,because the drive doesnt produce that much thrust to begin with the big point thats baffling is theres no fuel being expelled to produce the thrust would be good for keeping satellites in orbit if it works though as well as deep solar system targets probably too
technology,not_removed,because it does neither i think calling i a reactionless engine would be more appropriate although thats probably not an accurate name either
technology,not_removed,first because the thrust it provides is miniscule however miniscule thrust over a long long time high velocity lastly the guy who invented it named it em drive probably stands for electro magnetic drive since its basically just a microwave magnetron stuck inside a metal cone thing
technology,not_removed,its impulse power not warp speed
technology,not_removed,hyperspace is an excellent name for it
technology,not_removed,im as american as they get but this was initially conceived by our cousins the brits
technology,not_removed,invented by a brit
technology,not_removed,i dont know why youre being downvoted that is exactly what it is its basically a metal funnel well a cone really then they take the magnetron out of a microwave and have it shoot microwaves in the closed off metal cone thing seriously im not joking thats all the emdrive is
technology,not_removed,the problem with it is you cant hear it go beep in a vacuum so they dont know when its finished
technology,not_removed,first recharging cellphones in microwaves now this awesome
technology,not_removed,so not warp drive yawn
technology,not_removed,you sirmadam just made me so happy
technology,not_removed,did they test it in complete vacuum i mean in air it can produce some thrust because the microwave would expand the air in the cone and that might give some little propulsion no
technology,not_removed,you can already do that with photonic rockets the big deal is that this seems to be significantly more efficient
technology,not_removed,well not everyone though scientists get consensus ascribed even when its invalidated which actually undermines the aforementioned scientists judgement in retrospect i guess thats the point being made peer review pressure shot in the dark here the cone expands faster than it contracts the dampening effect and wave interference means relatively slower rates of contraction in metal elasticity vs stiffer crystalline molecular structure and efficient vectored ringing of wave energy during expansion this other factors account for the net vectoring of the delta thrust in the direction of the cones angle its not like a rocket in this respect but appears to be as performance characteristics would be defined in modeling seemingly insignificantly low thrust becomes indistinguishable with astronomically high thrust given a longenough time period as continuous acceleration causes velocity to approach light speed as a limit function either way its genius
technology,not_removed,it probably doesnt work of all published research is wrong just because they publish doesnt mean theyre not wrong note that other labs were unable to get this drive to work and havent bothered to publish so theres publication bias right there
technology,not_removed,a good summary but really thats how science works when someone discovers something odd the only thing we can say right now is that it kind of does work the thrust is quite low and inconsistent at times but nobody knows why it works like it does there are hundreds of hypotheses to explain why it works but that will take a lot of time to test all of the hypotheses
technology,not_removed,isnt it just throwing off electrons from the emitter the same way a light bulb is throwing off photons
technology,not_removed,the wild guess of how it might work if it works is via interactions with quantum vacuum plasma that is allowed under our current understanding of the laws of physics but would be very strange
technology,not_removed,you left out the bit about several other labs testing it and getting null results one other lab got lift but turned their device through degrees and still got lift oops
technology,not_removed,im ok with it not fitting into our current understanding of physics because that understanding flawed ie quantum mechanics does not fit with relativity theory
technology,not_removed,theres some dude that theorized that the emdrive works by forcing background radiation particles to bounce off the craft in a certain way with their momentum hitting the craft and causing the thrust if thats true its not actually physicsbreaking and not propellantless the propellant is just provided by a source outside the vehicle
technology,not_removed,feckin innovators
technology,not_removed,middle out
technology,not_removed,isnt that just a prostate milking
technology,not_removed,and just because you cant figure out exactly how it works that doesnt mean you dont like the results
technology,not_removed,i should have gotten a stem degree
technology,not_removed,except that no particles leave the system
technology,not_removed,quiet you were trying to short his bet
technology,not_removed,but theres a range of what can be there uh geez we didnt expect this result and here are a bunch of major things that might explain why this isnt what it appears to be versus yeah here are a few wellunderstood issues but as you can see we are pretty confident that we managed them and our result stands pretty well on its own
technology,not_removed,would be a waste of money if they wanted to test it they could put it in a sealed conductive box with a battery and a timer to turn it on and off hang the box from the replica of a pendulum from the cavendish experiment try in different orientations of the pendulum to cancel out magnetic effects edit wouldnt even need vacuum to rule out the claimed forces albeit with vacuum they could rule them out to better precision instead they have this nonsense where their supposedly reactionless drive is not sealed nor shielded and is thus perfectly free to propell itself or to interact with the walls of the vacuum chamber by any nonreactionless means known to man emitting a jet of evaporated plastic somewhere corona discharge microwave heating and warping of the leaf springs even shifts in its centre of mass their axis of rotation is not perfectly vertical etc etc frankly i have trouble naming a single known force that they had ruled out as the cause all while a hermetically sealed faraday cage around the drive it is critical that the measurement apparatus is not exposed to microwaves rules out almost everything edit as far as i know they got a very dramatic mismatch between the forces measured with cavity pointing in one direction and it pointing in the opposite direction very bad news for any claim that it is some kind of space drive rather than interacting with local environment not to mention that their graphs in the graph the microwave power was on during that interval marked seconds the other two dips are calibration pulses taken on the face value after theyve charged the hyperdrive for seconds it proceeded to propel itself in the opposite direction with an ever increasing force without needing any power input thats even more awesome not taken at the face value things warped while they were being heated more on one side than the other quick response then when the power was off temperatures began to equalize slow response after microwave power was off its just not difficult to accidentally create a non reactionless drive that turns watts of power into micronewtons worth of displacement id simply say micronewtons of force but it is also possible there was no force involved on the drive itself but only torque in the leaf springs note httpsenwikipediaorgwikicavendishexperiment measured smaller forces and was off by years ago so its not unreasonable to demand repeatable highly accurate results here instead from what i last seen the measurements with the drive pointing in one direction are not even within of measurements with the drive pointing in another its also interesting that people involved here paul march harold white worked on httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwoodwardeffectresults which has been falsified by two argentinian researchers using an enclosed self contained set up exactly as i described above on a much smaller budget so yeah you make a reactionless drive other scientists say it doesnt work and heres how we found out on the cheap you switch to a different drive and you proceed not to do what those scientists did to exclude superfluous forces that looks pretty damning
technology,not_removed,one group is going to try to launch a cubesat but its a bit of a different approach to the emdrive
technology,not_removed,the cannae people are on it httpcannaecomcubesat
technology,not_removed,seems like the kind of job for a cubesat
technology,not_removed,dont you remember we did that the moment we tuned on the engine it collapsed the fabric of space in a light year radius we all live in a virtual simulation now after alien archeologists picked through our wreckage just relics in an alien museum somewhere we all died long ago
technology,not_removed,why not just use a decommissioned icbm
technology,not_removed,no its impulse drive warp drive is next
technology,not_removed,i think it has to do a lot with how layman perceives science nowadays he sees topics in the news that would revolutionize everything like everyday how many times have you seen topic about how a new drug eliminates cancer when actually it really does not do that but its reported like that i think that a lot of people who criticize emdrive really dont want this to happen anymore than it already has it is easy to jump on the hype train i really really really want this to work but im seriously skeptical of it it sounds too good to be true and quite often those arent true furthermore there still hasnt been any credible evidence of this working sure there is some evidence but nothing even close to conclusive i think its great that people remain skeptical of this technology that is what science is all about asking questions in science the hype train usually translates into research which then determines whether something works or not for example graphene shit ton of research and money is being poured into it so that we might get it into consumer products it has bee shown that it really does have some awesome properties which could be exploited but mass production is very very hard to do and it doesnt help that data is cherry picked and not everything is reported in journal articles well this was a bit longer answer than i thought it would be the bottom line is that as long as there is no credible evidence to support your claim it should be questioned also if it violates known physics it should be questioned even more emdrive is a prime example of this i still think that every single hater wants this to work but they just arent convinced and thats fine edit a word
technology,not_removed,no one wants to see it fail they want to see science work and what were talking about right now isnt the drive its the reportage surrounding it someone writes a paper explicitly saying things like thrust was still measured even when the device was turned off which is typical of thrust due to normal heat but thats not what the article written about the paper says the article written by the paper says thrust was measured with zero reference to the rest of the work done by the actual engineers testing the thing the criticism youre perceiving is criticism of the reporting the papers are clear the device is doing what youd expect based on normal thermodynamics and so far any unaccounted thrust is well below the sensitivity of the test and with better sensitivity will almost certainly disappear this dude at eagleworks has this crazy hypothesis that would mean physics is wrong like the fma part the most basic part and because everything around us relies on thatwere pretty sure its not wrong so this claim is the most extraordinary possible accepting it requires a colossal amount of evidence of which so far there is none and the closer we look the less we see thats science dreaming about star trek ships flying around the galaxy isnt science its fantasy and the reporting surrounding this drive is focused on the fantasy because normal people will read that so when you see people saying come on theyre not saying come on hypothesis theyre saying come on journalists
technology,not_removed,hope is held on at a personal level not scientific level you cann rip it apart and hope youre wrong that is what makes it robust
technology,not_removed,you see the laws it appears to be breaking are very fundamental and well tested that does not mean its not working but the chance that it is is very slim so of course people are skeptical until there are several well designed and independent experiments that would confirm this theres little reason to be excited about this
technology,not_removed,science is literally all about being doubtful about others claims this is normal
technology,not_removed,i hear this same argument whenever someone comes up with yet another perpetual motion machine yes it would be revolutionary if it worked but no the universe does not work like that hoping that it works doesnt change the fact that it wont i dont care if its breaking any laws and let this thing just work are opposing sentiments
technology,not_removed,the more remarkable a discovery is the more people should be trying to kick the shit out of the thing if it still stands up after a monsoon of scrutiny youre probably onto something
technology,not_removed,being logical and scientifically based is circel jerk of hate now maybe the problem are people that gladly ignore science datas metodologies and facts and quickly become enthusiastic for every clickbaity discovery that happens once a month or so you know the people believing its possible to live years while theres nothing scientifically based that even suggests its possible to even reach years old for most of the people or believing in the future all work will be made by machines and all wealth redistributed to all people or that graphene will be like flubber etc theres a sub for people that cant differentiate science fiction from reality its called rfuturology
technology,not_removed,yeah were yelling science because so far all experiments done to verify that this device is producing thrust on its own have not been scientific theyve all been flawed you cant test something like this in atmosphere theres way too much potential for it to interact with the atmosphere in the chamber when before you were saying it will never pass peer review now your coming up with new excuses lol no not quite this paper passing peer review doesnt mean the drive works or the science is valid it just means the observed measurements are correct the paper could quite well show a null result if its explained through other interactions just because its a paper about the emdrive doesnt mean its a paper confirming that it works as described the abstract of the paper is just repeating previously made measurements no one is coming up with excuses at all let this thing just work this attitude is dangerous theres a massive gaggle of people who are desparate to see this drive work mainly from rfuturology and places like that and will go to the extent of spreading misleading information in order to further this view to the detriment of public interest science has always been about questioning radical ideas no one took einstein seriously when he came up with his theories of relativity he had the means to back up his theories though and eventually they were accepted as valid and the norm thats how science works theres also been plenty of false or quack ideas that have been proposed those havent been able to stand up to further inspection and so are disposed of as incorrect this is also how science works if people just accepted new theories and inventions as valid because they wanted them to be correct then wed be years behind where we are now string theory is cool but because theres no current way to prove it its still just an idea we cant just claim its correct because itd be great for humanity if it was when we have something like the emdrive which a claims to casually break hundreds of years of established physics and b is also potentially explainable by other factors not accounted for in the experiments performed then fairly hefty questioning and scientific evaluation is reasonable is it not
technology,not_removed,its a healthy mentality though always expect the worst and hope for the best if people shit all over it dismiss it whatever but its a real phenomenon itll work when further tested or eventually applied science is such a robust method or one would argue philosophy because of this resistance to popular opinion id argue that this popular response is simply the sociological counterpart to its scientific review
technology,not_removed,thats how science works man its not that we want to see it fail or that we want to see it succeed we want the facts as clear as possible to increase our knowledge of it that is the point of science to increase our knowledge after our knowlege of this has improved we can use it to apply it to practical life if it lends itself to it or save it for later as a physics experiment to understand the forces interference at work in this experiment for future experiments
technology,not_removed,not really he basically drew out this isnt a science article you dumb fuck into a few paragraphs
technology,not_removed,if there is undisputable evidence i dont see why not not that theres much chance of this ever happening thats what science is all about
technology,not_removed,name one investment hes made or are you just assuming hes so arrogant he cant change his mind when presented with evidence which is a defining attribute of a scientist
technology,not_removed,i heard the em drive doesnt claim to violate momentum instead it pushes off the quantum vacuum particles that pop in and out of existence so its pushing off of something but that something almost immediately disappears right after this is what i heard i am not knowing if this is true or not
technology,not_removed,hes a scientist they do that all the time
technology,not_removed,i doubt that scientists love facts if it can be properly proven that it works then anyone who still claims that it does not becomes the crackpot
technology,not_removed,he also is yelling that people are ignoring science of the drive maybe thats because we still dont fully understand why it can work outside of some theories actually aside from theory im trying to point out that the emdrive has been a case study in horrible experimentation the results of which are improperly taken at face value which lead to some wild and untrue conclusions and there are theories but they require major exceptions to current physics which have been debunked by more than one person photons can have inertial mass when talking of particle mass physicists refer to the rest mass by default the photon has zero rest mass its nonsensical to ascribe an inertial mass to it edit by that i mean this comes from an outdated way of looking at mass that no one uses anymore inside the cavity the speed of light changes only if there is a medium inside the cavity otherwise there is no a priori reason to think that thats a huge deal but we cant ignore that different research groups across numerous countries have replicated the results either you can if their results are of poor quality as a hint take a look at major physics publications research coming out of major departments or even at rphysics youll find little to no content on the emdrive in fact emdrive topics are now removed from rphysics
technology,not_removed,if inside the speed of light changes its because of interactions between the photons and the gas im the chamber the same as any optical medium
technology,not_removed,and there are theories but they require major exceptions to current physics photons can have inertial mass all physicists agree that photons have inertial mass his gobs of text is not basically call people crackpots he provides clear citations of his claims but it sounds like you didnt read that far since you got half of your major exceptions to current physics wrong
technology,not_removed,its super cheesy and horriblebut i really do love that movie
technology,not_removed,it would be a lot more convincing if those years of experimentation could show something more than results which are most likely in the error margins
technology,not_removed,and making alcohol the ancient greeks never learned why crushed grapes became wine
technology,not_removed,we still dont fully understand how photosynthesis works afaik
technology,not_removed,to be fair the laws of biology in those days were if you sin you get sick sailors are filthy in body and soul therefore illness is the natural result
technology,not_removed,back then they knew it had something to do with acidity but this was back when people thought that the body was controlled by humors httpsenwikipediaorgwikihumorism it could be that there is some sort of mechanism going on that we arent observing or we have some level of misunderstanding of the laws of physics scientist can come up with theories explaining how this works or why it cant work but those are theories it is possible to have an active knowledge on how to make something happen without knowing the fundamental basis on why it works when you think about how things get very complicated in physics on the particle level there could just be things we arent observing if it is working than there is something we are missing it might be decades before we can get to that levels of observance im not saying to not be skeptical skepticism is great im just giving reference to historical instances where we didnt understand something despite the best theories and sciences available the only way to crack this is through research testing and observation
technology,not_removed,thats a strawman fallacy disproving homeopathy for non lay people is very simple double blind trials have shown that it doesnt work after samuel created homeopathy in anyone so inclined could have easily disproved it the very next day it took scientist till years to figure out how that worked the understanding of why citrus cured scurvy involved understanding what an amino acid is which involved understanding molecular biology etc etc there was a lot of theoretical stuff to figure out before understanding why it worked there is nothing more than basic scientific method to understand if it works in this particular case people have a knee jerk reaction because they say it breaks theoretical models of physics which is a completely wrong place to approach it from imo
technology,not_removed,thought it was more or less established that homeopathy is almostpure placebo effect
technology,not_removed,teach people about peer reviewed research im all for them testing this to death there was the case of cold fusion where cold fusion reportedly happened peers tested it and were unable to duplicate it it could be that the cold fusion did happen but not in the way the researches thought it happened that is why they were unable to reproduce it and then it was nothing more than a research anomaly the best way to figure things out is to keep testing and testing attack the beast from every angle until its weakness is exposed if several scientist get the same results then they should test it in space if it works in space then great if not then its a dud
technology,not_removed,the original comment is about how scientists can encounter a new discovery without understanding it basically implying that this could be at play here i dont think the original comment was attempting at all to make a statement for or against the sociological issue of pseudoscience nor was it trying to declare the propulsion problem as solved i see that youre trying to say that we essentially dont know at this point whether its a real discovery but i dont think its fair to compare this research to homeopathy these arent dedicated pseudoscientists declaring success without evidence these are scientists doing research and seeking peer review on something that seems like it could maybe be something we dont understand and theyre willing to admit that it could be noise but we dont conclusively know one way or the other yet scientists have to consider that our fundamental understanding of reality could be wrong when doing research we prove to ourselves time and time again through science that it is wrong and revise
technology,not_removed,well what actually happened was they showed that it worked but citrus oranges specificallywere expensive because it was imported from afar they tried all sorts of methods until they gave up and stopped doing it this video explains it better httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcgofqcnzifk basically its a good idea not to overlook things or forget about them it would be better to disprove that it works than to outright forget about it or ignore it its like being a detective and finding a clue and then being like meh
technology,not_removed,a simple cubesat can be quickly developed for a few thousand dollars especially if buying component from of the shelf company like isis space then a cubesat launch goes from free agency or launch provider sponsored to cheap under if i remember well so hardly tens of millions but usually in the academic world iterative design and testing is not how the game is played probably because it feel unscientific and a bit like cheating i honestly wished it would be different that would have helped my thesis quite a bit
technology,not_removed,its not worth our attention that isnt necessarily true so far it has stumped a lot of very prominent people and if it doesnt work the research that eventually debunks it could very well be quite valuable simply by revealing what everyone had missed the whole time said research could potentially illuminate a path that hadnt been considered which leads to further discovery science really doesnt require blueprints or a full explanation of something it just requires a problem that cant currently be explained which the thrust from this thing very much is
technology,not_removed,the rossgellar field isnt gonna happen until we invent the rachel static tachyon field which in itself is difficult without the joey particle beam
technology,not_removed,so its bloodmagic got it
technology,not_removed,i think there is a difference though those were more of engineering problems did someone claim that those things are against the current understanding of laws of physics i do not mean to undermine those feats but i see a big difference
technology,not_removed,fun fact nato and scuba are acronyms uk and usa are initialisms
technology,not_removed,where is your source that it confirmed original findings
technology,not_removed,it does work eh to be specific the experiment sees changes in readings at the fourth decimal place as to it working as in moving objects around no dont get me wrong thats more than enough of an anomaly to justify further research but the very best you can say about this is unproven
technology,not_removed,so all i need is to strap my microwave to a car and ill be able to warp to the nearest star in min got it
technology,not_removed,so either the experiment is flawed and the instruments are pushing against a magnetic field of the earth or something or it really works and we are a decade away from true starships you forgot the other possibilities the experiment was seriously flawed and simply doesnt work the author is outright lying
technology,not_removed,would this thing provide a constant i thought it was much less strong than that
technology,not_removed,also space is not a complete vacuum there are enough particles to bump into that eventually it would reach a terminal velocity one less than light speed
technology,not_removed,our only goal is to lift kids into the orbit to get hit by things
technology,not_removed,the original inventor is claiming that the thrust nasa is achieving is a decade behind where private industry is and they are currently working on a device to produce tonnes of thrust boy is that ever an easy claim to demonstrate
technology,not_removed,the original inventor is highly critzied if it actually produces tonnes of thrust ill be shocked theres used for drives like this basically in space travel where constant thrust in a mostly firctionless environment is huge especially with no fuel but i doubt its going to be lifting humans
technology,not_removed,you can discuss new technology without becoming pretentious twats who think they know better than the experts some of the shit in this thread is absolutely ridiculous in their criticisms as if an undergraduate degree is sufficient for them to critique multiple people with phds along with the reviewers and journal editors
technology,not_removed,it doesnt use fuel all it needs is electricity a reactionless drive is a pretty big tech improvement even one thats extremely weak
technology,not_removed,a little bit of thrust over a long period of time goes a long way
technology,not_removed,the problem with conventional rockets is that you have to throw stuff out the back to move yourself forward but that also means that you not only have to move yourself you have to move all that fuel with you too to do that you need even more fuel which means more weight and yet more fuel its a vicious cycle a drive that doesnt need a reaction mass to throw out the back means that you dont have to have all that extra fuel and then more fuel to move your extra fuel and so forth
technology,not_removed,this is true but most redditors arent good scientists theres a lot of comment simply saying things like i cant wait to see this proven wrong a lot of people even scientists are defensive of the status quo and things that appear to threaten it are often given undue amounts of criticism neurogenesis was treated this way when it was first proposed and it took decades of proven research for it to finally be accepted
technology,not_removed,exactly so why is everyone making that out to be a bad thing
technology,not_removed,for several centuries all of our best theories of physics have been incorporated into new theories without being overthrown our current theories have already been confirmed in the region where this guy says theyll fail and he has no basis for this claim
technology,not_removed,this is a very good comment it is so hard for people to accept that what they think they know may not in fact be true our science now may only be partially true or true for all the wrong reasons
technology,not_removed,is it really that cut and dried that this has to violate conservation of momentum to work perhaps the device is emitting momentum via radiation andor mass in a way thats not appreciated yet
technology,not_removed,that just means there might be laws we havent discovered yet
technology,not_removed,for all the unsolved problems we need to tackle to accomplish a mars colony thruster efficiency isnt one of them even if the em drive fails i think theres still plenty of hope to see a colony in our lifetime
technology,not_removed,which might i add is extremely fundamental to our understanding of physics
technology,not_removed,true for this generation emdrive but if this turns out to be real and they can refine it watch out straight out of their faq q how can the emdrive produce enough thrust for terrestrial applications a the second generation engines will be capable of producing a specific thrust of thus for kilowatt typical of the power in a microwave oven a static thrust of tonnes can be obtained which is enough to support a large car this is clearly adequate for terrestrial transport applications
technology,not_removed,actually no it wouldnt httpemdrivecomfaqhtml
technology,not_removed,once in orbit g is enough
technology,not_removed,to create a space fightersheesh i actually do the math and i get downvoted
technology,not_removed,also could you click on it for me please im way too lazy also the reason i didnt look it up myself lol jk just messing with you thanks
technology,not_removed,the hero that we need thanks
technology,not_removed,what i mean is this thing may be trying to rotate in place this would not violate conservation of momentum but would turn the rotating test rig
technology,not_removed,i wondered about that but they were talking about the engine being usable in the atmosphere would it be as efficient as a chemical rocket probably not but safer for one
technology,not_removed,to be fair the alcubierre drive requires mass with negative energy densities this just requires playing fast and loose with the concept of momentum and where it comes from
technology,not_removed,rshittyaskscience
technology,not_removed,no but i claim your sarcasm detector is broken
technology,not_removed,thank you for these simple to understand responses
technology,not_removed,isnt the real advantage be that if you point it somewhere in space it will just keep speeding up as it has no fuel and just constant acceleration
technology,not_removed,i dont really know why people view this as a noenergy drive it uses electricitybut youre right any test done thus far is only relevant to flight in space reactionless no fuel
technology,not_removed,because it does neither i think calling i a reactionless engine would be more appropriate although thats probably not an accurate name either propellentless engine its propellent the engine supposedly doesnt need rockets use propellent ion drives use it too this emdrive claims to not require propellent
technology,not_removed,interestingly a lot of microwave ovens of different kinds have been built in which the microwaves have been very precisely measured electrically without any unaccountedfor loss of energy or change in momentum carried by microwaves down to something like one trillionth the force applied by microwaves reflecting off a microwave oven wall is where p is power of reflected radiation in watts and c is the speed of light if the microwaves were bouncing off magical dark matter donuts inside the microwave oven resulting in micronewtons of thrust on the microwave oven the kind of thrust theyre claiming at least watts worth of microwave radaition mustve been deflecting off the magical dark matter donuts which would probably be about the kind of effect that would begin to concern the engineers of an actual microwave oven that you use to warm your real donuts not to mention radars and all sorts of radio equipment
technology,not_removed,every time i comment starts with i dont know why you are being downvoted i look at the points and its over i have nothing of value to contribute
technology,not_removed,what makes that highly controversial
technology,not_removed,i imagine at least part of the controversy is because of how absurdly simple the idea is like lighting some decayed dinosaurs on fire and using that to propel a car
technology,not_removed,but with enough improved em drives we could make hover boards launch giant space stations and spaceships to space
technology,not_removed,and to think someday we will heat up our hotpockets while transporting them to the plate what a wonderful age we live in
technology,not_removed,as i gather they are testing at lower and lower pressures and they are getting less and less thrust indicating this could just be a very inefficient ion thruster
technology,not_removed,are there photonic rockets in real life i am looking around online and there isnt anything built yet they appear to be theoretical for the moment do you have a resource to point to
technology,not_removed,who was it that said that most scientific discoveries dont start with an eureka but rather with a thats odd
technology,not_removed,the fact that it kinda does work makes it worth studying more right just because it would break laws of physics because it kinda works and there is no explanation as to how it work doesnt mean it doesnt kinda work perhaps what we know about physics is slightly wrong and the engine does make sense it is dogmatic to consider what we know as infallible what we know about physics could be wrong in any case keep studying this shit and figure it out but dont exclude the possibility that what we know is wrong
technology,not_removed,nobody knows why it works like it does i dont understand how that happens someone designed and built this thing clearly with propulsion in mind they must have had some concept for how it would work ahead of time scienceengineering dont really involve slapping random parts togethet and then saying i wonder what this does oh its a propulsion system
technology,not_removed,no yes its throwing microwave photons around but it does not emit them in theory and it is supposed to be more effective than a photon rocket pointing a lightbulb backwards
technology,not_removed,the emitter is actually throwing off microwave radio frequency photons not electrons but now that you mention it asymmetrical interactions with the electrons in the metal cone might produce some thrust by kicking them off the metal surface at high speed thats pretty much how tiny the thrust theyre talking about is
technology,not_removed,its important to note that none of these emitted microwaves actually leave the device its a completely closed system
technology,not_removed,the emitter generates electromagnetic emr radiation at microwave frequencies a light bulb also casts emr but primarily visible and infrared frequencies
technology,not_removed,as far as i know quantum vacuum plasma is a completely made up phrase and it doesnt explain where the momentum is supposed to come from because the vacuum doesnt have momentum
technology,not_removed,everyone would be okay with that but the smart money is still predicting that it will fit into our current understanding of physics for some mundane reason that so far has been overlooked
technology,not_removed,quantum mechanics fits completely fine with special relativity just stuff moving close to the speed of light its problems are with general relativity our theory of gravitation quantum gravity is only relevant in crazy extreme situations like neutron stars the singularity inside a black hole or the big bang it cannot occur in a situation like the emdrive basically what im trying to say is that you cannot just invoke the god of the gaps in this case the fact that we have no theory of quantum gravity to justify the emdrive for quantum gravity to apply here would require a breakdown of all our theories in physics not hyperbole here to the point it wont even be clear quantum gravity is a thing to begin with
technology,not_removed,well so long as you arrange by hip height
technology,not_removed,yes this is reddit where all scientific hope goes to die and every enthusiastic newsposter is painted a blueeyed sensationalist
technology,not_removed,i got some cfd on that bet wanna buy
technology,not_removed,im just still confused about how this passed peer review am i misinformed about what peer review is
technology,not_removed,this is a very solid comment and highlights why im glad the paper is coming out getting to see their best arguments and data out in the open gives us all more of a chance to pick it apart
technology,not_removed,as in she cannae take it capn or as in the place where hannibal defeated the romans
technology,not_removed,the cannae drive people are trying edit not sure why im getting downvoted for better or worse my understanding is that they want to launch a cubesat to confirm their version
technology,not_removed,but to remember us by
technology,not_removed,in the book elon musk tesla spacex and the quest for a fantastic future by ashlee vance it is explained that when purchasing decommissioned icbms from the russians the only ones supplying decommissioned icbms at the time the russian were overcharging elon by a ridiculous amount and when the russians would not negotiate their price elon and his crew packed up and flew back to america on the flight home elon devised that he could create and send up a rocket for cheaper than what the russians were willing to sell one for
technology,not_removed,im not a scientist im an airline pilot with a degree in aeronautical engineering and even as such the mainstream medias obsession with science reporting and the surrounding sensationalism as with all things that modern media reports on is driving me insane for years now ive taken to actually reading the published papers once a subject catches my eye referencing whatever i can online and asking my friends in the science community when i cant because the way the press writes it up is absolute drivel
technology,not_removed,its weird that this thread is full of people who are essentially attacking nasa and casting deep aspersions upon their credibility as a scientific establishment one of the highest comments suggest nasa dont understand that uneven heating of a spring would cause it to distort mean really the guy probably cant even fix his car when it breaks and hes assuming his knowledge of engineering is better than the people who went to the moon and built the fucking space station but its all in the name of attacking blogposts and shitty articles which theyre the only people looking at this is blue sky science what they do is try some fairly radical things and when one of them is interesting they take a really close look at whats causing it and then if they cant find out what it is they do an even closer look then a closer look and a closer look and again these arent kids fucking around these are people who are at one of the most significant science institutions in the world theyre doing very complicated things and its very interesting if you wanted to you could follow these stories in journals and publications which really know what theyre talking about instead though youve dug through the trash and found someone that you dont like who isnt in your opinion great at talking about it and youre holding them up and screaming look at this rubbish defund nasa now they dont know what theyre talking about theyre wasting money on rubbish they dont even understand basic physics theyre crackpots why would you do that have you ever thought that maybe its fine if people who just enjoy exciting news have some fun once in a while that these people arent hurting anyone and you could instead of supporting them with clicks and attention find someone you actually do like to support someone talking abut the things you are interested in or telling the tales in ways that conform to your expectations
technology,not_removed,physics already has their hypothesis that keeps the motor within reality the em drive electrons are becoming quantam entangled with some electrons outside of the housing and that is whats causing the propulsion seems like a sound hypothesis based on what we currently know about quantam entanglement
technology,not_removed,true but not quite the full story the main thing i took away was that this is being published in a garbage journal that isnt to be taken seriously
technology,not_removed,wrong the content posted also mentions several reasons to be highly dubious of anyone posting about emdrives and it exposes the papers author as a known perpetrators of fraud so it does three things critiques the news report as badly written science journalism critiques the physicist who wrote the paper as a fraud critiques the fundamental hypothesis being discussed upon which the emdrive would operate were it to work as contrary to heavilytested and highly agreedupon science
technology,not_removed,i think thats maybe a bit unfair there was no as hominem and all of the points look valid to me edit oops there was he called him a crackpot the post was removed so hes reinstated it without that word in that case you were right that it was a bit of a fuck you i still think it was overall a good critique but accept that it could have been a bit less aggressive
technology,not_removed,you can see why some scientists might be resistant to the idea lifelong career invested in one model something comes up that threatens that cognitive dissonance takes over at that point majority of scientists keep their pragmatic head but the presence of crackpots suggests their are all types on the spectrum no true scotsman and all that
technology,not_removed,it is what they say and that is plausible however the circumstances of the experiments results orientation zeropower results and the lack of controlling for external variables mean that it is hard to rest on them
technology,not_removed,shawyer disagrees with you edit added relevant timestamp
technology,not_removed,and it will lower the speed of light in that gas most people dont realize that c is the speed of light in a vacuum while the speed of light is lower when not in a vacuum thats actually what causes refraction and as one result rainbows
technology,not_removed,he provides clear citations of his claims but he doesnt make any claims he just makes ad hominem attacks
technology,not_removed,and mendel never knew about dna
technology,not_removed,true but we understand waaaaay more about the mechanics of it than we did a couple hundred years ago when some people thought it was straight up magic
technology,not_removed,not true at all it was common knowledge that certain actions could make you sick regardless of your spiritual state and that some things could aid you to recover from sickness even if you were a sinner this has never been in doubt medics have never ceased to exists since ancient times in fact many priests were the equivalent of medics and used herbs foods bandages and other very material based stuff to heal people
technology,not_removed,if it is working than there is something we are missing the idea that we might just have missed a conservation law being wrong seems really dubious conservation laws arent just an accident emmy noether proved mathematically that they correspond to fundamental symmetries of the universe if this turned out to be true we wouldnt just have to slightly tweak things a lot of physics that has been tested and retested over three centuries would be wrong wed have to come up with some reason why it ever worked in the first place and there are red flags the effect is extremely marginal at the limits of observability the principle researchers have announced previous breakthroughs that turned out not to be true sure its science and science is falsifiable new data could knock out all of our theories overnight but in this case the consequences are so great the results so marginal and the investigators sufficiently dodgy that i would bet overwhelmingly that no effect which breaks the law of conservation of momentum exists
technology,not_removed,my point was simply that controversy and difficulty are not an argument in favor of further research or putting more resources on an result that is not reproducible or significant despite the lack of scientific evidence that homeopathy works people continue to pump money and resources including scientific research at both disproving and proving that it works we shouldnt bump a better experiment out of a rocket payload when the terrestrial results are not particularly convincing any more than its worth money doing research on homeopathy although we can debate the value of changing opinions on homeopathy
technology,not_removed,i dont disagree with those statements but even in the case of citrus curing scurvy the results were easily reproduced despite scientists not understanding the mechanism until the evidence is much stronger that this works payloads are much better spent on other research regardless of how fantastic controversial or unorthodox the claims are
technology,not_removed,you two should be friends
technology,not_removed,the thrust that it achieves is actually just the screams of those who have died a violent death no big deal cause no one can hear screams in space anyway
technology,not_removed,we discovered the pentaquark we discovered the quantum eraser a thing that seems to defyeverythinglinear timespacelogic we created timelike effect in photons using entanglement we created photonic matter we sent probes to deep space using sails that are propelled by light
technology,not_removed,i mean if you have any electrical source of thrust you might be able to increase that thrust either by increasing the power supplied to one device or by increasing the number of devices
technology,not_removed,right now it produces an extremely tiny amount of thrust if it turns out its actually producing thrust and isnt some error wed have to isolate the actual mechanism that causes the thrust and find a way to exploit it to produce exponentially greater thrust than it is currently producing assuming its actually producing thrust
technology,not_removed,uhh maybe were on a different page it was my understanding the levels of thrust now were orders of magnitude less than whats really considered useful
technology,not_removed,roughly extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof itll be awesome if it pans out but it wouldnt be the first time the next great thing has turned out to be a little more manureoriented than first advertised
technology,not_removed,exactly there can be numerous other things at play which still doesnt violate any laws its just that its using a mechanism we arent aware of it could be something as crazy as its somehow repelling inter dimensional quantum particles weve yet to discover
technology,not_removed,no it doesnt it means that literally all of physics from the ground up is wrong yet somehow gives exactly the correct predictions if this was true reactionless thrust it would be the biggest ever upheaval in science and make galileo einstein and the quantum revolution look like minor tweakings to put it into context reactionless thrust is being able to grab one of your own arms and lift yourself up into the air thats the level of nonsensical this is
technology,not_removed,exactly we dont know everything be skeptical but also be open minded
technology,not_removed,me too thanks
technology,not_removed,i mean yeah but the nsf forum is a little weighty to point new people to if they are interested enough to read the subreddit a little theyll find it
technology,not_removed,try rqthruster
technology,not_removed,its about as efficient as current ion propulsion systems that we use for satellites and deep space probes except that it uses no fuel just that makes it an extraordinary leap in space propulsion if it is any stronger we start to get into serious scifi scenarios
technology,not_removed,wat i cant tell if youre being sarcastic the alcubierre drive is permissible by theory if its experimentally possible it breaks causality—which is why we assume the exotic matter required by the drive cant exist—but even causality isnt technically required by theory all of our theories work fine without causality which is to say time travel is theoretically possible since we do experience causality we assume it holds but if we later find out it doesnt nothing breaks down except our minds since time travel is confusing but physics is fine with it the emdrive require you to break conservation of momentum which is a fundamental aspect of every single theory in physics it breaks everything from newtonian mechanics all the way to string theory and no you cannot handwave a quaaaaantum vacuum plasma explanation thats not how this works thats now how any of this works if the quantum vacuum worked as some sort of momentum sink which allows the emdrive to propel itself without violating conservation of momentum then quantum field theory is false in which case you have no basis to believe there is a quantum vacuum to begin with
technology,not_removed,i think it needs energy still what it doesnt need is mass flying backwards
technology,not_removed,not necessarily acceleration just not as much chemical heavy fuel to make it scoot
technology,not_removed,i knew someone would come along and correct my terrible terminology ive been listening to too many sci fi audiobooks
technology,not_removed,i thought one theory is that it uses virtual particles as propellant i know what you mean though not sure what to call it real matter propellantless
technology,not_removed,this is why your microwave carousel rotates keeps the food from being shoved very very slowly to the side of the microwave oven
technology,not_removed,wait wait wait are you saying if i keep my microwave turned on with the doors open facing down it will eventually fly
technology,not_removed,not really the frustums being used instead of microwave ovens need to meet specific requirements to generate the thrust a number of theories have been presented on why some dealing with variance in wavelengths to whatever else i also dont recall anyone ever measuring forces exerted on a microwave wall but that shouldnt work either according to shawyers design parameters
technology,not_removed,everything about this drive screams scam and yet respectable scientists seem to be taking it seriously edit which gives the lay observer like myself reason to pause and think that just maybe there might be something to it
technology,not_removed,if the materials and geometry can create a kind of photon recycling like in laser propulsion you get orders if magnitude more thrust but in this case the laser is on board if you had a frustrum with a perfect mirror inside you could do this with visible light too right
technology,not_removed,but the times you dont see it its because its been downvoted into oblivion
technology,not_removed,whenever someone mentions about a post being downvoted either their own or anothers as long as it isnt a complete trash post it tends to reverse the voting direction for it
technology,not_removed,i dont know why youre being downvoted this happens to me too
technology,not_removed,yea well it swung really quick when i commented he was at or something
technology,not_removed,i dont know why you are being downvoted
technology,not_removed,because the microwaves are sent into the funnel but they dont really come out some of them do come out but it isnt enough to account for the thrust it provides imagine you had a sealed box and you had a fan inside the box you turn the fan on and suddenly the box starts getting some thrust but its inconsistent thrust physics says the force from the fan should counter itself since its inside the box yet for some reason the box moves
technology,not_removed,because it defies our current understanding of physics that in and of itself is not enough to dismiss it out of hand but is a big red flag because the results are so weak that experiment error hasnt been ruled out so here we have an effect that defies some long standing models of physics but whos effects are close to the limits of accuracy of the instruments measuring the effect it could be real but the safe money is still on measurement error or some other yet to be discovered error in the configuration of the experiment
technology,not_removed,but your car would only really move in space the thrust it provides is miniscule barely enough to push of a pingpong ball a few microns a minute
technology,not_removed,most of the controversy is around conservation of energy or propellant free thrust theres the question of why is it breaking the for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction to which proponents say its not necessarily breaking that rule maybe its reacting to something were unaware of there are all kinds of theories some people say the microwaves are bumping into dark matter that is flowing through the little funnel thing and flinging the dark matter away thus providing thrust other people think it has something to do with gravity and think the emdrive might be a link to the electromagnetic force and gravity all sorts of crazy ideas right now that people are trying to test hell half of the ideas nobody even knows how they would be able to test if thats what it is or not yet then theres tons of scientists that simply dismiss it as uninteresting and farcical me personally i think its fascinating and definitely deserves more scrutiny and testing edit disclaimer since after reading it i think people might misunderstand i am not in any way a scientist i can see how my last sentence might imply that im a scientist but i assure you i am in no way anywhere near to being a scientist im just some dude
technology,not_removed,decayed then geopressed
technology,not_removed,i can already hear amazon scrambling to be the first to patent an intergalactic diarrhea service
technology,not_removed,getting less and less thrust thats not true in the slightest the near vacuum tests were conducted at a fraction of the power of atmospheric tests due to the need for and availability of components that operate in a vacuum the thrusts recorded were within proportional bounds to the atmospheric tests
technology,not_removed,well thing is ion thrusters need fuel xenon or other gas if this thing produces little thrust with no fuel input basically inefficiently converting electricity to thrust this might be a game changer
technology,not_removed,where is your source that lower pressures are producing less thrust
technology,not_removed,from the little i have read about them they dont exist but they are theoretically possible and mesh with current science they would need further development and possibly some scientific breakthroughs to make work but since they fit into our understanding of the universe that is not an insurmountable problem emdrive requires us to alter our understanding of the universe so if it is shown to work it is a bigger deal
technology,not_removed,the most exciting phrase to hear in science the one that heralds new discoveries is not eureka but thats funny httpsenwikiquoteorgwikitalkisaacasimovknowledgeandscience
technology,not_removed,i literally typed your comment into google and the top result says isaac asimov
technology,not_removed,the fact that it kinda does work makes it worth studying more right of course and thats why lots of people are studying it no one is questioning whether this should be studied more but it is worth noting that even just confirming that the effect really is real is not easy perhaps this is just another con that has fooled some good scientists it wouldnt be the first time and it wont be the last you might say its dogmatic not to take this seriously immediately but how many scientists lost their reputations on fake discoveries remember n rays
technology,not_removed,imagine thousands of years down the road aliens show up you guys still havent figured out propellantless thrust yeah well it seemed to work but we didnt know why so we all decided it clearly didnt work
technology,not_removed,sometimes science its more art than science a lot of people dont get that
technology,not_removed,yeap which is why a lot of scientists are studying it more
technology,not_removed,the fact that it kinda does work makes it worth studying more right just because it would break laws of physics because it kinda works and there is no explanation as to how it work doesnt mean it doesnt kinda work yup the most likely possibly is that well find a flaw in the testing methodology that can inform future research youre right that there are other possible outcomes too in any case keep studying this shit and figure it out but dont exclude the possibility that what we know is wrong they arent hence the further study the problem with getting your hopes up too early is that it can burn people on further research if this one device doesnt pan out proper science goes this seems to be producing thrust but it shouldnt and then tries out successive ways of invalidating the result andor testing out alternative hypotheses the frustrating thing for folks in this case is the lack of alternative explanations paired with the muddled experimental results no one has offered a consistent explanation of how it could produce thrust and every measurement of its thrust is very near error margins it beats out control experiments so we cant prove it doesnt produce thrust but we cant seem to amplify the thrust so we cant prove the experiment isnt broken either we lack clear unambiguous results
technology,not_removed,that happens way more often than you apparently realize having an actual understanding of the mechanisms at play in a novel device is not typical if it is stateoftheart in the right ways
technology,not_removed,from the article the emdrive is the invention of british scientist roger shawyer who proposed in that based on the theory of special relativity electricity converted into microwaves and fired within a closed coneshaped cavity causes the microwave particles to exert more force on the flat surface at the large end of the cone ie there is less combined particle momentum at the narrow end due to a reduction in group particle velocity thereby generating thrust his critics say that according to the law of conservation of momentum his theory cannot work as in order for a thruster to gain momentum in one direction a propellant must be expelled in the opposite direction and the emdrive is a closed system however shawyer claims that following fundamental physics involving the theory of special relativity the emdrive does in fact preserve the law of conservation of momentum and energy so there was a theory behind the idea which apparently led to the drives invention its just that the theory is controversial and the results hard to explain
technology,not_removed,its the difference between knowing your wife is mad at youand understanding and being able to explain why your wife is mad at you
technology,not_removed,similarly everything electronic is made by wirebonding every chip processor die even credit card all wirebonded but nobody really knows how it works how to do it yes how to optimise it yes but not exactly why it works it involves melting the metal far below its melting point and all the obvious ways it works like friction welding and super localised heating have been ruled out but youre reading this on a screen full of wirebonds
technology,not_removed,afaik the guy who came up with it noticed that satellites he was working on were deorbiting a little bit quicker then they should be according to physics
technology,not_removed,several great inventions came from working on something getting unexpected results and going hmm thats funny
technology,not_removed,well cathode ray tubes batteries and semiconductors can all claim this origin just someone randomly playing around and then noticing something as we are familiar with them today they are highly and deliberately engineered products but when they were first invented they were exceeding simple devices that barely worked the way they do today the em drive as it exists is analogous to the battery formed by a pair of metals stuck into an orange not a relatively high tech and highly engineered lithium ion battery this isnt a design and built thing its a component from something else stuck into something else just to see what happens its not a propulsion system its a small amount of force being observed
technology,not_removed,scienceengineering dont really involve slapping random parts togethet and then saying i wonder what this does they kinda did though they were testing for something else and noticed the reactionless propulsion as a secondary effect
technology,not_removed,i remember them say they found it by accident whil working on something else
technology,not_removed,the wright brothers made the first plane but they didnt exactly know how lift works they kind of just copied bird wings it took awhile for people to work out the dynamics of flight
technology,not_removed,someone had a hair brained idea he read somewhere that small amounts of rf energy were going unaccounted for so the energy is going somewhere right where we dont know its kinda weird so he looked at a microwave and figured if he took the door off whatever the rf energy was getting dumped into might leave it and thrust turns out that it might actually work how now you get the blank stares the idea that you can just emit an rf wave and somehow get thrust without any reaction mass violates some fundamental laws of our understanding of motion how exactly are those waves imparting an impulse on a mass we dont know they shouldnt if the em drive proves out its going to have a lot of physicists working for a long time to explain just how it does and the next time you wonder how you can start building machines that use a physical concept you dont understand just look up and realize were still hashing out exactly how airplane wings generate lift while building
technology,not_removed,how effective can a photon rocket be
technology,not_removed,tiny thrust in space is all you need
technology,not_removed,well the measurement youre really looking for is dick to floor call that
technology,not_removed,reddit is full of arm chair scientists
technology,not_removed,at least we found the cure for canceragain
technology,not_removed,at least the headline wasnt scientists just discovered a method for reactionless propulsion trip to andromeda planned for next year
technology,not_removed,the problem is that most scientific discoveries posted in the news are really just overly sensationalized halffinished studies people want this to be true so badly but everything we know about physics says that it cant happen which means that if someone wants to prove to a real scientist that it is happening you need to really cross all your ts and dot all your is but scientific rigor is just seen as being a downer by the people who want this to be real so bad they can taste it
technology,not_removed,browneyed person here i take offense to this remark i feel way more hopeful than blueeyed people
technology,not_removed,whats wrong with blue eyes
technology,not_removed,science isnt spongebobyoujustgottabelieve bullshit its harddataorgtfo where you actually cant change the laws of physics if something is too good to be true then it probably is skepticism is what got us this far not a bunch of magical thinking
technology,not_removed,peer review can be two people reading your article while swamped with their own work and pointing out a few minor easytospot errors without thinking too deeply about your experiment and results or it can be someone reading over your work with a fine comb because theyre the worlds leading expert in the subject and have tried very similar experiments in their own lab in this case they may reject your paper over disagreements on interpretations rather than actual problems with the experiment in my experience you usually get one reviewer closer to the doesnt give a shit end of the spectrum and one reviewer closer to the gives all the shits end of the spectrum but generally skewed toward the middle of course this all varies from journal to journal and field to field the true test of someones work is how much it gets cited in the future to expand upon the results the peer review process is held up on a pedestal by people outside of the scientific community but what really matters is whether the community embraces your work
technology,not_removed,peer review means a number of experts looked it over carefully and couldnt find any mistakes it doesnt mean there are no mistakes or that the drive works there have been a number of impossible results from experiments that have been published such as httpsenwikipediaorgwikifasterthanlightneutrinoanomaly each time they eventually tracked down the equipment errors and determined nothing goes faster than light yet
technology,not_removed,how this passed peer review passing peer review doesnt necessarily mean that your experiment is airtight peer review means you have been kind of scientifically accurate its normally whether or not the data can survive the scrutiny of the field as a whole that would cause people to believe in the data and not just peer revision for journal publication real peer revision is people tearing it a new one in conferences and in subsequent studies
technology,not_removed,yeah your points are lacking from a guy whos being utterly and completely content free here edit im going to clarify i do not believe in the unverified results weve seen thus far yeah then why youre giving it the most classic pseudoscience support an attack of you dont grasp the whole thing without making any actual points link the last published data by these guys that contradicts what i said or go away
technology,not_removed,either it works or the satellite safely deorbits itself seems like a winwin
technology,not_removed,esquire has a good write up or excerpt and it wasnt just the markup it was that they negotiated a price and changed it at the last minute because they could what was he gong to do go build his own rocket
technology,not_removed,but then how will the enterprise ever travel to the past and help us achieve warp
technology,not_removed,exactly i feel the same i am genuinely interested about what results they can produce if they can be proven but seeing as i dont follow specific journals have to trawl through sources such as the one about which is often hyperbole
technology,not_removed,its bc reddit is full of depressed and extremely pessimistic and angry people they see the negative in every situation or experience and wonder why they are so miserable all the time
technology,not_removed,the journal isnt garbage per se its the fact that the journal doesnt cover or peer review the important aspects of the technology its simply a technology application journal and theres no reason to assume that something as potentially groundbreaking as this technology is should be published in a reputable physics journal
technology,not_removed,lifelong career invested in one model on the contrary most physicists embrace new things because its much easier to get papers out in a new field than in an old established one the reason people doubt the emdrive is because its exactly as fantastical as a perpetual motion machine it is one in fact
technology,not_removed,theres one thing thats definitely stronger than any kind of stubbornness or cognitive dissonance and that is data a wellexecuted experiment to the quality where not even the most cynical physicist can dismiss the data however thats up to the people trying to prove the emdrive is a real thing whatever has been done so far is not even close to being enough
technology,not_removed,and einstein never knew about the internet
technology,not_removed,nothing a little blood letting couldnt cure
technology,not_removed,we shouldnt bump a better experiment out of a rocket payload when the terrestrial results are not particularly convincing that is a solid argument and i have no reproach of it glad it got clarified
technology,not_removed,my point exactly
technology,not_removed,its not reactionless though
technology,not_removed,theres your problem this isnt reactionless thrust this is propellantless thrust which is almost as amazing the idea is that the machine trades momentum with virtual particles popping in and out of the vacuum not a violation of newtons law
technology,not_removed,technically every is a space they use it to shoot down satellites
technology,not_removed,thats true i just wish the subreddit hadnt devolved into absolute madness
technology,not_removed,hey mono thanks i will
technology,not_removed,theres a lot of misinfo in this thread as far as that goes it definitely needs electricity but yeah the reactionless aspect is being overlooked
technology,not_removed,you got it right a reactionless drive or engine is an engine that produces thrust without using propellant httpsenmwikipediaorgwikireactionlessdrive
technology,not_removed,virtual particles sounds like bullshit
technology,not_removed,rshittyaskscience
technology,not_removed,my microwave doesnt have a carousel is my food in danger of being launched into space
technology,not_removed,no no its rotating because of the emdrive effect the nicer microwaves specifically vector the em thrust in a conal pattern thus providing a gentle rotationally directed velocity that ensures your pizza or lets be honest here pizza pocket gets a niiiiice even cooking session
technology,not_removed,just tested can confirm carousel rotates the theory warrants more research
technology,not_removed,well itll push upwards with the force of roughly its power divided by the speed of light less because its not all directed down more if its laying on a metallic surface that reflects it back
technology,not_removed,no but if you put it in a low gravity environment it would slowly speed up over a period of years this tech is more for deep space satellites that over time could accelerate to great speeds apparently indefinitely
technology,not_removed,but the real questions is if it can fly can it achieve warp
technology,not_removed,you are doing it wrong you have to put the microwave oven inside a metal cone
technology,not_removed,thats the whole point of peer reviews other people look at your data try to replicate your results and see if it somewhat legit
technology,not_removed,they did too but when experiment after experiment yielded the same results they got a bit worried and sweaty
technology,not_removed,because we cant be completely certain its not real so the best way to be as certain as possible is to build a prototype and see if it works people claim to have done so and seen measurable results so now we need to verify those results or disprove them as there could be something to it realistically nothing will come of it but its still better to check an idea than dismiss it just because it doesnt fit with how we think albeit with a high degree of accuracy the universe works
technology,not_removed,wait are we talking about an emdrive or the ecat oh right the one with peer review got it
technology,not_removed,longest buildup for an april fools day joke ever
technology,not_removed,pretty sure its matter that doesnt interact with electromagnetic radiation which makes it invisible to electromagnetic spectrum
technology,not_removed,selection bias
technology,not_removed,well i imagine this same effect would happen if the fan blew out air fast enough to cause quantum tunneling the microwave thing must work because the teeny electrons are small enough and move fast enough to start doing quantum things instead of classical physics things like were used too
technology,not_removed,reminds me of when cern thought that they detected neutrinos exceeding the speed of light httpsenwikipediaorgwikifasterthanlightneutrinoanomaly
technology,not_removed,the inventor claims that much higher levels of thrust have been produced for years and classified
technology,not_removed,even figuring out the source of any measurement error would be useful science progresses whether the damn thing works or not
technology,not_removed,for more thrust he can always plug a flare into his cars gas tank
technology,not_removed,sounds like a pretty shitty service
technology,not_removed,this is already possible it is called a photon rocket httpsenwikipediaorgwikiphotonrocket that is not why emdrive might be a game changer it might be a game changer because it claims it would produce a much higher thrust than a photon rocket could in a sealed cavity
technology,not_removed,fitting that its asimov that said it
technology,not_removed,i literally typed your comment into google let me tell you about this wonderful new invention called copy and paste
technology,not_removed,perhaps it is a con however do not attribute to malice that which can be explained by other means it could be mistakes or stupidity my only point is be skeptical but also be open minded n rays what about relativity that wasnt taken seriously either you win some you lose some but we learn in any case the intention of my comment is to calm all the immediate disbelieve as scientist everyone should be saying huh thats interesting i have concerns so lets study this more
technology,not_removed,i do not remember n rays
technology,not_removed,it would be more like oh hey we see you all have warp drives but rather than use them for travel you guys jam food in them to quickly heat it up
technology,not_removed,exactly the opportunity cost is pretty high but the benefits could be drastic
technology,not_removed,this seems so much like a scene that douglas adams would write
technology,not_removed,sounds like a plea for validation from an artist
technology,not_removed,honestly sounds like hes just blowing smoke and got random thrust when he tried it if you say something that seemingly violates a conservation law doesnt actually violate a conservation law you show people the math you dont say no ur wrong
technology,not_removed,the theory is that its pushing against quantum foam
technology,not_removed,more like if you had the intent of making her mad at you you do something she becomes mad at you and now you dont know why
technology,not_removed,metals will self weld if they touch without either a passivation layer or if there is no air between them if you take two pieces of aluminum into space scrub off their oxide layer and then poke them together they will spontaneously weld metals will forget they arent connected to each other if they directly touch on the microscale this might be happening
technology,not_removed,at the very least hes come up with a reason for why some satellites arent maintaining orbit properly which is still pretty useful to science because then those microwave emitters could one day be used in part to at least maintain orbit meaning less conventional fuel is needed to keep them up cheaper satellites is always nice
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,au contraire the wright brothers were well versed in the literature of other aeronautical inventors at the time and when their results did not match the published literature they built their own wind tunnel to obtain results directly httpwrightnasagovairplanetunnelhtml
technology,not_removed,its not terribly efficient to get decent amounts of thrust you basically have to have a redonkulous deathray if you were going to match the performance of a launcher like the falcoln youd basically have space battleship yamatos wave motion gun
technology,not_removed,true but if that is the secret its just a rather inefficient ion drive
technology,not_removed,this is a great paper and all but have the authors considered that causation correlation also the maillard reaction
technology,not_removed,ha i just realized armchair scientists could still be actual scientists its not like chair arms prevent you from writing research papers
technology,not_removed,also full of actual scientists too place is huge
technology,not_removed,i agree naturally i remember getting enthusiastic about waterpowered laptop fuel cells already back in what i appreciate though is healthy skepticism not vaporware neeext
technology,not_removed,the last paper i got reviews for from a supposedly excellent conference came back with reviews with the only content this is very interesting and was rejected because there were so many highly rated papers i could have produced all of those reviews in minutes each the true test of someones work is how much it gets cited in the future to expand upon the results the peer review process is held up on a pedestal by people outside of the scientific community but what really matters is whether the community embraces your work many excellent papers published at exquisite places get cited very rarely for example when your paper closes a discussion and people say show is over lets go somewhere new to get funding
technology,not_removed,you missed the guy whos just having a bad day and wants to shit on your work
technology,not_removed,peerreview is a waste of resources it didnt prevent the south korean scandal with the stem cell cloning and in nichefields the other peers usually are your competitors and will try to block your publications and also might use the idea in them for themselves
technology,not_removed,well id put it more like a number of experts typically or looked it over and couldnt find any drastic errors or basic oversights there can certainly be mistakes in papers that pass peer review in general the reviewers dont repeat the work to check it at least not in physics
technology,not_removed,good example thanks
technology,not_removed,youd think russia would have learned not to challenge americans to get into space
technology,not_removed,please if that were our timeline we would have already lived through the eugenics wars of the
technology,not_removed,agreed but we dont have that data to say one way or another yet so until then cognitive dissonance sidenote its also upto people trying to disprove it as a real thing collaborative effort
technology,not_removed,and i still dont know who my biological father is
technology,not_removed,that student abraham lincoln
technology,not_removed,not
technology,not_removed,it isnt and yes our universe is far far stranger than even the weirdest scifi movies make it to be
technology,not_removed,the best kind of shitty science the kind i had to think about for a second
technology,not_removed,not likely it could spontaneously slip between spacetime dimensions however
technology,not_removed,that is awesome brb science experiment edit guys guys it works d see you in the science papers im off to the moon riding a microwave
technology,not_removed,its probably closer to impulse technology than warp technology
technology,not_removed,im reminded of all the people who doubted relativity and quantom theory who claimed the universe had to behave in a certain way
technology,not_removed,id rather be skeptical and surprised to be proven wrong than hopeful and then let down
technology,not_removed,what matter does interact with electromagnetic radiation otherwise we wouldnt be able to see shit since the visible band would just pass through everything depends on both the object and the radiation
technology,not_removed,well thats the general idea but no one can point to any particular quantum thing or things that would result in thrust we have invented a technology we cant explain hence the controversy theres no reason this should work and whatnot
technology,not_removed,they never thought that they got a weird result couldnt figure out why and released the results for worldwide brainstorming stupid people thought they were claiming neutrinos travelled faster than light
technology,not_removed,sure but those claims are unverifiable so not terribly useful in evaluating the plausibility of the device
technology,not_removed,well see then youre back to the old way with a propellant something thats heavy and gets expended in use
technology,not_removed,i literally typed your comment into google let me tell you about this wonderful new invention called copy and paste let me tell you about this invention called highlight right click search google
technology,not_removed,when i was in grade back in the early i was given the homework assignment of writing times i will not speak out in class teacher agreed to let me type it instead
technology,not_removed,as scientist everyone should be saying huh that interesting i have concerns so lets study this more your comment reminds me of another great quote it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it aristotle
technology,not_removed,n rays were discovered about the same time as xrays by one of the most respected scientists in france at the time whose name ive forgotten this was about years ago iirc other scientists tried and struggled to reproduce the results independently although many visited the original lab and confirmed their existence eventually one scientist who doubted that n rays were real visited the lab and surreptitiously removed a critical prism from the n ray device lo and behold the n rays were still apparently observed by the first scientist basically an accomplished scientist while being honest by anyones standards thought he discovered something that just wasnt there however this is of course why we have the scientific method in the first place
technology,not_removed,they look at each other wait does that work hot food in seconds
technology,not_removed,for example rogaine was initially meant to treat ulcers hair growth was a side effect it also failed to properly treat ulcers
technology,not_removed,more like you want your wife to get mad at you you try something wierd and she does get kinda mad at you but when you tell the story to your buddies they tell you that you cant get your wife mad by doing that and that she wasnt actually mad but just pretending to and that your way of getting your wife mad violates the law of conservation of impulse and so on
technology,not_removed,im aware of the phenomenon but it doesnt happen in atmosphere you do get some funny interactions like skip gauges but not the same thing but yeah stir welding van der walls forces mechanical binding via ultrasonic deformation lot of theories on the table dunno but its cool that it works
technology,not_removed,but it wont require a fuel altho it would take a long time for an ion drive to run out it can run out
technology,not_removed,fencing response
technology,not_removed,im a scientist i wish my chair had arm rests
technology,not_removed,armchair scientists should just stick to opinions on armchairs as that is their explicit area of expertise
technology,not_removed,do you know those flow charts of how to reject every possible paper by following a simple process
technology,not_removed,i dont understand why youd think peerreview is a waste of resources im guessing it varies from one field to another and it definitely varies from one journal to another but while it doesnt guarantee that the content of a paper is perfect its a necessary first step to filter what doesnt belong in a given journal for various reasons or to get the author to properly revise their paper for clarity for completeness because of an important missing citation because of a lack of context because a proof needed to be reworked because the angle the authors took didnt fit the target audience of the paper and needed to be changed even though the content was good etc etc do i enjoy spending a day or more writing a review for an article that doesnt really interest me all that much when i could be working on my own research no do i enjoy the fact that the published version of my papers is often substantially better than the one i originally submitted thanks to the comments of my reviewers do i enjoy the fact that i can go to a conference and see talks that have an average quality much higher than the average quality of the ones whose proceedings papers didnt pass peerreview yes to both for sure peerreview isnt a perfect process but its definitely not a waste of resource if there was a simple and better alternative trust me we wouldnt keep spending our time reviewing other peoples papers for free just to keep the system working
technology,not_removed,its not perfect but it still keeps blatant bullshit out its the more subtle scandalousifcaught bullshit it doesnt catch but science has other corrective mechanisms then
technology,not_removed,maybe we did and they were secret wars
technology,not_removed,thats abraham buscemi thank you
technology,not_removed,far far stranger than even the weirdest scifi movies make it to be then you havent watched flesh gordon
technology,not_removed,report back in an hour tell us how it went e umondayexe he reported back
technology,not_removed,so does charging iphones microwaves are awesome
technology,not_removed,probably closer to whim than impulse
technology,not_removed,exactly for every one good theory there are hundreds of failed ones but if we never bother checking those failed ones and just dismiss them outright we would never have found the good one
technology,not_removed,well heres the exact definition for you then dark matter is an unidentified type of matter comprising approximately of the mass and energy in the observable universe that is not accounted for by dark energy baryonic matter ordinary matter and neutrinos the name refers to the fact that it does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation such as light and is thus invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum
technology,not_removed,i dont want to presume this drive works yet but i really hope it does itd be nice to have something tangible that could one day bring us to another star
technology,not_removed,we have invented a technology we cant explain which is super cool it has potential practical uses and no one understands it its like magic until in years we discover its giving everyone space cancer anyway
technology,not_removed,engineers do what they dont understand scientists understand what they dont do
technology,not_removed,this i did not know thanks
technology,not_removed,sorcery foul magic burn the witch
technology,not_removed,holy bucky balls this is a game changer how did i not know about this you sir are doing gods work
technology,not_removed,teaching coding in schools
technology,not_removed,if being compared or whatever to aristotle isnt a very high compliment then i dont know what is but thanks
technology,not_removed,one shuffles back onto the ship gets a hotpocket from the fridge and holds it up to the thrusters
technology,not_removed,in other words even women make more sense than quantum physics
technology,not_removed,directions unclear dick stuck in wife
technology,not_removed,can confirm mine has no parts which could be considered arms for the purpose of resting however it does swivel and roll
technology,not_removed,link
technology,not_removed,i think youre referring to
technology,not_removed,the comparison is still reductive though sure there is value in finding scientific truth in anything personal if nothing else but opening science to peer review is just as valuable as the original idea because it distills more good ideas
technology,not_removed,i think the stem cell scandal was in osaka actually
technology,not_removed,i recently came across a peer review paper about a gpu algorithm that was a big deal and cited a lot they had info about how fast it ran on certain gpus they sent us their code and it did the wrong thing the paper never included accuracy results its still published in ieee they had a fundamental misunderstanding about how gpu code runs and their implementation never could have given the right results the idea was right but could not be implemented on a gpu the way they described when i confronted the authors they stopped responding pretty quickly peer review is crap and scientific journals are becoming crap only positive results get published and funded so people make up shit to keep their labs alive the whole system pushes labs to do crap science and its never discovered until someone tries to recreate the results
technology,not_removed,til abraham buscemi was a firefighter at pearl harbor
technology,not_removed,an hour and no report
technology,not_removed,it was microwave all along
technology,not_removed,wow way to bring back for me
technology,not_removed,underrated comment
technology,not_removed,space will give you cancer no problem
technology,not_removed,i mean id die of cancer in exchange of seeing another world
technology,not_removed,any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic arthur c clark
technology,not_removed,i think its just a chrome thing edit disregard
technology,not_removed,im pretty sure hotpockets come after microwave ovens on the tech tree i mean who would eat those things if you had to actually take minutes to do them in a toaster oven
technology,not_removed,guys guys it works the humans have changed everything
technology,not_removed,no there are scores of scientists working on understanding quantum physics nobody has the hubris to try to understand women
technology,not_removed,it would require fuel but not reaction mass which is the big problem with rockets the distinction often gets overlooked because chemical rockets tend to use the same thing for both fuel and reaction mass for example with an ion drive the electricity is the fuel and the accelerated xenon gas is the reaction mass in a liquid fuel rocket the fuel is burned for energy and sent flying as reaction mass if the emdrive works it would use electricity to generate thrust without reaction mass a reactionless drive this appears to violate newtons laws of motion and a number of conservation laws
technology,not_removed,it is from the sun
technology,not_removed,solar energy kinda is altho that drops of in strength quite quickly with distance
technology,not_removed,more research is necessary to confirm or discredit the functionality of furniture apparatus for the purpose of resting human appendages
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,hope he delivers im also interested in this
technology,not_removed,agreed peer review is important but reproducing data is sorely lacking its hard to get funding for those experiments and its probably not too glamorous of the time i think a national requirement for bachelor of science graduation should be to reproduce data from a published study and integrate it into a free database it would be good practice and glaring data inconsistencies would be uncovered
technology,not_removed,rip udeadpool wait hes probably just heating up some tacos e httpsiimgurcomiqtvpovpng he does like tacos though
technology,not_removed,im using firefox and i use that method on a regular basis it also seems to be built in
technology,not_removed,well these beings did just travel light years to get to us i doubt waiting is that huge of a deal to them
technology,not_removed,that sounds like an amazing idea oven baked pastries with filling on the inside that you can conveniently eat on the go if only time travel existed and i could go back in time and corner the market with my own brand of meat piestm
technology,not_removed,microwave ovens come right after radars my exgirlfriends physics professor was an intern during the cold war and in those cold early morning desert testing grounds the staff used to just hang out in front of the experimental radar to warm up
technology,not_removed,this chain has made me giggle far too much
technology,not_removed,thats because of risk v reward no amount of quanta investigation and probing is going to net you the grief of attempting to understand your own so let alone a total stranger on the other hand what is the reward of understanding women universal hatred from that sex for exposing its secret motivations quanta arent secretive they are just unknown discovering their properties can lead to fame fortune and a principle named after you
technology,not_removed,whats so difficult about it though cant we achieve this by using photons like shining an led constantly forever
technology,not_removed,but when youre moving past pluto you aint getting enough
technology,not_removed,maybe but not having to carry a reaction mass still means your space craft has more room and less mass for other stuff like say an rtg which can provide electrical power for decades
technology,not_removed,hey i know him he taught my modern physics class fancy seeing him here
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,that sounds like a sensible idea seems very unlikely that a world famous experiment reproducer could exist in the current setup
technology,not_removed,good luck to them its the clean way ahead
technology,not_removed,i think of two gigawatts as two nuclear plants and i think back to the future confirms it
technology,not_removed,more than enough to send marty back to the future
technology,not_removed,wasnt this done in gb this is what happens when you outlaw tech like that parents just travel elsewhere to get it done
technology,not_removed,just what the world needs more censorship go fuck yourself instagram
technology,not_removed,something something slippery slope
technology,not_removed,whats the feature not reading comments you dont like
technology,not_removed,welp goodbye instagrram
technology,not_removed,feature in this context they either mean an inaccurate automated algorithm or a reporting system with no accountability that will lead to de facto censorship
technology,not_removed,pretty much done to protect the kardashians taylor swift ftfy
technology,not_removed,wow you sound really bummed you cant harass women on instagram anymore
technology,not_removed,i think you are getting downvoted because people assume you mean this will destroy instagram as a wibsite i took it to mean you were personally done with it care to clarify
technology,not_removed,yeah it sucks
technology,not_removed,no what i mean is this is how it starts
technology,not_removed,interesting sorry for all the downvotes even if someone disagreed you have a completely valid point that is relevant
technology,not_removed,lol like i care what some idiots on a website i mostly visit for the porn think
technology,not_removed,well i never said you did its just annoying
technology,not_removed,wrong sub post to rtechsupport
technology,not_removed,i have a question if he submitted the survey it records your email and it allows multiple responses which it does for some reason and he gets the teacher to force it to be a single response per email would it bring up the page that says you can only submit this once
technology,not_removed,will do thanks i dont go here often
technology,not_removed,so americans dont like it when free market goes against their favour colour me surprised
technology,not_removed,what are the benefits of this will it stabilize the value of the currency
technology,not_removed,congrats to bobby lee on the great quotes
technology,not_removed,alright everyone move your money into dogecoin
technology,not_removed,no but it is an example of how as put it the implicit cooperative commerce model of geeks runs headon into the real world like the internet itself
technology,not_removed,hmm this is the same business insider that is running bluekai eyeota krux digital liveramp lotame visualdna and these are just the ones im pretty sure are functioning as httpsenwikipediaorgwikipersonalizedmarketingdmp theres also the comscore scorecard research beacon and tradedesk there along with sailthru though thats probably more of a internal recommendations mechanism than anything else this is not to say that fb starting to conflate data with external data providers isnt interesting but id thought it was obvious they were already doing it or planning to and it comes off a bit dishonest to write a veiled critical article about fb when doing pretty much the exact same thing themselves theres also some massive irony in that both bi and propublica run facebook custom audience on their pages
technology,not_removed,i dont dispute that is it newsworthy but wasnt this commonly known accepted by complacent users
technology,not_removed,do they really need to with a plethora of telemetry options and backdoors they already have in facebook and whatsapp do they really need anything else
technology,not_removed,i can give them a quote instead for my life will sell for cheap price
technology,not_removed,yeah but saying hey these guys do it too isnt really a pass for facebook i feel like doing that is an excusatory point more than an exclaimed point about a company giving a shit about how many condoms are in my wallet
technology,not_removed,check also the ccc talk and the book httpcrackedlabsorgennetworksofcontrol by wolfie christl and sarah spiekermann
technology,not_removed,i think everyone knew facebook was selling their online data not buying their offline data
technology,not_removed,its about filling out the data tags and segments they have so that advertisers can target ever narrower audiences
technology,not_removed,what do they even have to gain from this
technology,not_removed,which i just shut down with umatrix problem solved
technology,not_removed,dont you get it facebook users are the commodity the more information on the commodity the more the commodity is worth credit reports driving records health issues political leanings who you associate with what you say how you type where you live where you work all of this can be pulled from what is currently available on the net regardless if you think there are laws to protect you or not credit has these laws but people are getting around them because you give them the info freely facebook is one of the few platforms where your real name is used on the web why would the government need to spend money on collecting data when you give it to them for free through facebook
technology,not_removed,idk i mostly just complain about my abusive cat i mean ifuncle sam is really that interested in my cats drinking problem by all means
technology,not_removed,you have no idea then
technology,not_removed,network security admin suicides would increase
technology,not_removed,so basically a really expensive really bulky trick coaster that only works with specific cups and doesnt prevent condensation from dropping off the glass and onto the base or table below it sounds practical
technology,not_removed,came here to mention the condensation problem too because the inventor completely failed to consider the purpose of a coaster
technology,not_removed,crack that whip give the past a slip step on a crack break your mommas back
technology,not_removed,i like how everyone thinks that them using floppy disks is a bad sign yeah its old as hell technology but its harder to hack if its not connected to the internet no reason to replace it even if they upgraded to new computers theyd have to rewrite all the codes triple check for embedded viruses on the circuit boards they purchase and that opens up a lot more cracks if they can be hacked while its being created
technology,not_removed,they found a perfectly fine usbstick in the parking lot and are going to use that
technology,not_removed,zip drives am i right
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,and to think i used to be afraid to let floppy disks be put through airport xray machines
technology,not_removed,someone in the government mustve influenced by the reddit comments regarding the previous article
technology,not_removed,moving on to microfiche
technology,not_removed,put the controls in the cloud i am pretty sure that has never been hacked before
technology,not_removed,punch cards it is then
technology,not_removed,its also wise to maintain and train the system and its users on complex outdated or perhaps simply out of use technology to further strengthen its defense against hackers or other attackers who are more likely to be unfamiliar with the operations and processes required i guess they never saw war games
technology,not_removed,i dont think its a bad idea but im wondering how robust the systems are electrically maybe we have a bunch of spare parts and use newer monitors or something who knows i hope they just dont hire some idiots to upgrade these systems or put them on the cloud or something crazy
technology,not_removed,this but im generally antinukes anyway so id rather they just not
technology,not_removed,we can call it the msroom cloud
technology,not_removed,well the existing system isnt all that robust either floppy disks degrade a little every time you use them as well as passively degrading over time
technology,not_removed,like put the launch codes onto president clintons email server
technology,not_removed,you cant be the only country without nukes they are just too powerful mutually assured destruction is the best true deterrent knowing that if you launch nukes at us youll be obliterated too that said im very much pro nuke weve had years since the nuclear bomb was created i wonder how much more powerful theyve gotten even if its out of some morbid curiosity id love to see a modern day hydrogen bomb level an entire country at once it would be horrifically awe inspiring
technology,not_removed,well no you cant be the only country without nukes but it shouldnt be that easy to destroy human civilization and thats what it has become it would be neat to see but i have my reservations about the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki much less anything that could happen now
technology,not_removed,thats a fucked up unpopular confession have an upvote
technology,not_removed,but i have my reservations about the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki japan agreed to surrender before we dropped either bomb their only condition was that they get to keep their emperor which we didnt like turns out we let japan keep their emperor anyways they were unnecessary well no you cant be the only country without nukes of countries have them
technology,not_removed,thats because the us wanted to test those bombs and who better than japan even if they had agreed to surrender
technology,not_removed,thats not my reasoning but it works too i disagree with the premise that civilian casualties are acceptable especially when the government isnt a democracy
technology,not_removed,yeah i dont believe that it was believed that japan would be much harder to break than germany and as such we needed to beat them into submission turns out it was the opposite of what we expected racism played a huge role in that
technology,not_removed,the us has killed the heads of multiple democratically elected countries we install military dictatorships to take their place this is an ongoing problem i disagree with the overthrowing of countries that are complying with un regulations which risks the lives of us service members costs trillions of dollars all without significant aide from other un members eg uk france germany spain turkey etc we pay our allies to commit literally troops and claim to have allies in the fight against iraq we overthrew iraq and installed saddam hussein gave him wmds to use against iran who we also overthrew and were surprised when he used them against his own people now with saddam gone isis and the islamic state took his place democracy or the lack of democracy shouldnt be a factor in who we choose to overthrow we overthrow democracies in the name of cheap oil we keep countries in power that sell us cheap oil torture their people and have countless human rights violations eg saudi arabia we are the supplier of landmines worldwide very little of what we do is justified there is a reason we dont have allies that help us
technology,not_removed,thats awesome really i was a little freaked out sitting down there with zero service or signal last time i went ended up on the wrong train because my app couldnt update and was headed to the bronx a dude was pretty nice and noticed we were obviously lost and told us we should really get off and head back and catch the correct train because we dont wanna be down here right now
technology,not_removed,will be the year of spying on new yorkers
technology,not_removed,damn now theres not a single place in the metropolitan world where you can determine whether someone is batshit crazy or just talking through their bluetooth device
technology,not_removed,great a packed train full of people yapping on their cells i used to live on the f where it went above ground and literally a second after it left the tunnel the phones would come out this will suck
technology,not_removed,whats the obsession with free wifi
technology,not_removed,sits quietly with laptop in monitor mode just keep sniffing sniffing sniffing for christ sakes people when in public at least use a cellular connection
technology,not_removed,they have this analog device in every station thats called a map try it some time
technology,not_removed,i wouldnt bother using it its probably monitored to all hell and back and not secure from other passengers sniffing your facebook sessions
technology,not_removed,um not really think about itits for tracking people thats all it is in fact subways that have it have shut it down during protests and whatnot big brother is watching you now in the subways
technology,not_removed,the bronx sounds fucking terrifying how bad is a place when people warn you not to go there
technology,not_removed,and murders chicago has plenty of murders in subway
technology,not_removed,data plans suck
technology,not_removed,people want to be session hijacked spied on
technology,not_removed,mainly for safety reasons i thought most smart phones can call over wifi now or at the very least send a text or use social media to get out an alert for help
technology,not_removed,stood there yelling how do i get to manhatten over and over maybe it was broke
technology,not_removed,but but it doesnt make my httpswwwscientificamericancomarticlemajorcellphoneradiationstudyreignitescancerquestions like wifi does
technology,not_removed,vpns are a thing
technology,not_removed,ive been using it regularly now pretty much everyday on my way to work except i use it to check if there are citibike spots available near my work i take one once off the train and to check for subway delays i imagine im very lame to track
technology,not_removed,sir we cant track people or see their status updates while they take the subway operation commander that shit ends tomorrow
technology,not_removed,they can already track you if you have a mobile phone on but now they will have an easier time to find what type of porn you watch the must
technology,not_removed,what if you use a vpn
technology,not_removed,in fact subways that have it have shut it down during protests and whatnot big brother is watching you now in the subways lol gonna need a source for that one with proof of a deliberate subversive effort by the city to stifle communication ill wait
technology,not_removed,nice tinfoil hat
technology,not_removed,my last boss grew up there he was puerto rican and from a military family so when i told him that story he laughed he said it was only because i was white and had my kids with me new yorkers are a bit more abrasive compared to texas i should add he said it was more of an issue that i would be an easy target to be swindled or harassed maybe mugged but probably not like my life was in danger
technology,not_removed,i thought subway just had childmolesters
technology,not_removed,unlimited calls sms for € is pretty cheap
technology,not_removed,man in the middle
technology,not_removed,there are usually big signs that say uptownbronx or downtownmanhattan also
technology,not_removed,you have to start with the word siri
technology,not_removed,yes they are but they are too complex for some people
technology,not_removed,i imagine im very lame to track if your phone is connected they could use any number of exploits to gain access to many more things than just your web history
technology,not_removed,wifi tracking is better more accurate and more reliable than cellular tracking and wifi cellular is better than either individually yes this is for tracking purposes
technology,not_removed,strictly speaking its way easier to track you over wifi just see which access points a mac address connects to connecting that mac back to you is a little harder but its still the easier and probably way more legal thing to do
technology,not_removed,are you asking if a virtual private network will keep your virtual network private well that depends on how much you know and trust your von provider and if your provider is free
technology,not_removed,ya cmon man this aint chicago
technology,not_removed,but at least theres signal
technology,not_removed,yeah not so much in north america
technology,not_removed,actually not anymore past couple years things have changed
technology,not_removed,oh yeah it is the big apple
technology,not_removed,which is pointless when you already have cameras watching people
technology,not_removed,strictly speaking its way easier to track you over wifi just see which access points a mac address connects to you dont even need to connect to the ap to be tracked just have wifi or bluetooth enabled on the device will do nicely have a look at youtube for cisco mse for more info
technology,not_removed,tldr depends
technology,not_removed,for on tmobile us network people are lazy they dont switch and prefer to pay high price rather than research available options
technology,not_removed,most americans also prefer to get their phones from plans which locks them to their carrier instead of paying upfront for unlocked
technology,not_removed,tmobile doesnt work everywhere
technology,not_removed,soon to be three and rip tmobile
technology,not_removed,verizon total wireless offers for att offers for sprint ringplus offers for
technology,not_removed,what an awful title he didnt leak vines source code
technology,not_removed,are they telling me the truth it doesnt matter if you are renting the modem from them just have them replace it
technology,not_removed,thatd what i needed thanks
technology,not_removed,jazzmutant was selling multitouch music controllers in
technology,not_removed,the hard part about this is that even if they have proof revealing it would likely expose agents in the field or weaknesses in russias intelligence community that we want to exploit
technology,not_removed,but rpolitics told me it was true and i was a moron
technology,not_removed,it doesnt matter who hacked the dnc what matters is the content and corruption that was found in said emails
technology,not_removed,of course they werent able to make the case because there wasnt a case to make in the first place
technology,not_removed,deleted
technology,not_removed,already posted here wow you russians are dumb
technology,not_removed,the implication of this is that obama is attacking russia with sanctions and diplomatic expulsions based on false evidence about state hacking its disappointing that obama would base his decisions on false intelligence and lie to the american people about it if thats what happened
technology,not_removed,careful how long and deeply you stare into the black crystal orb you might not like the truth you choose to see
technology,not_removed,we just have to wait and hear what elon musk has to say the man is literally a god
technology,not_removed,and the russians have a track record of trying influence other elections georgia and chechnya hard to see enough plausible deniability to not be worth an investigation since the leader of the senates wife got a job with the new administration i kind of doubt therell be much of one
technology,not_removed,the article does say that the report feels stripped down and hastily assembled its possible that there is evidence only congress is going to see due to reasons of means methods security guess well have to wait and see what the congress critters do
technology,not_removed,rpolitics is such obvious propaganda i feel like im talking to bots half the time
technology,not_removed,yeah it wasnt russia it was martians
technology,not_removed,uh yeah it matters the dirtier a politician the more reason they have to support russia thats a problem for nonrussians
technology,not_removed,yeah no if a foreign nation intentionally hacked our election in an attempt to influence the results than it matters
technology,not_removed,da comrade i am agreeing with you big time
technology,not_removed,this isnt one of those things that are mutually exclusive they can both matter and they do to reasonable people
technology,not_removed,people dont care about the content of the emails unfortunately the news tells them what to think and how to think their big bad putin distraction is working sad
technology,not_removed,oh please does anyone who knows anything about national security think that they would release actual proof that could compromise sources and methods
technology,not_removed,did you even read it its not even well written
technology,not_removed,i think this progress last time we did that we actually started a war
technology,not_removed,of all the threads you could make that sardonic comment in you chose the most irrelevant one
technology,not_removed,people say that but you cant say we have proof and then say oh but you cant see it plus they did not interfere with the election this had nothing to do it the election podesta fellfor a fishing scam alllegedly like a moron back in march when trump wasnt even the nominee there is so much guessing and hypothetical being thrown around as fact
technology,not_removed,you mean like uranium one and the clinton foundation pay to play bullshit
technology,not_removed,the only influence it has was exposing the dnc for what it truly is also there is still no evidence that it was russians
technology,not_removed,they didnt hack our election whoever hacked anything assuming it wasnt just leaked by seth rich they hacked the dnc which isnt the government either which isnt much of an accomplishment by the way it hardly takes a state actor to get into somebodys phone if theyre as stupid as john pedosta and their password is literally password or if theyre so stupid as to have their server admins come on reddit with accounts linked to their real names and ask how to do illegal shit for a vvip the russian hackers is just a convenientand dishonest excuse to point away from the known sloppy security policy of the dnc and from the content of the emails
technology,not_removed,i love the hypocrisy of this argument would you say it matters when the us influences foreign governments as well because brace yourselfthe us has been doing that for decades
technology,not_removed,so is ars technica now an alt right site
technology,not_removed,shills are going to shill
technology,not_removed,implying elon musk is not the most relevant person of all history and is the greatest human being that has ever lived how do you sleep at night are you literally hitler
technology,not_removed,nothing about allegedly his it guy told him it was a legit email but meant to say not legit or something and podesta clicked the link in the phishing email and gave away his password
technology,not_removed,yes you can especially since the cia deals in human int im fine with it if congress sees the evidence
technology,not_removed,i know this is hard to fathom but after the election is over you actually have to focus on governing what hilary did or would have done is irrelevant if pay to play is wrong why does no one care that trumps cabinet are entirely unqualified campaign donors why does no one care that trump is appointing financial regulators from goldman sachs youre entitled to hate hrc for the rest of your life but it is entirely irrelevant to what trump is doing now if youre going to engage in political discussion please remember you dont have a scapegoat to fall back on trump now has to govern and so far hes gone back on every promise he made while simultaneously adopting the policies he claimed made hrc unqualified using but but but hillary was selling children out of a pizza parlor is not discourse focus on now that trump won and how magnificently he had turned his back on everything he said during the campaign otherwise you look like an uninformed asshole who doesnt know the difference between running for office and holding an office
technology,not_removed,pay to play still a talking point six of trumps top donors are now in his cabinet
technology,not_removed,how long do you autsright people think blaming people that are not in power is going to work
technology,not_removed,good one vlad
technology,not_removed,what it truly is a bunch of political animals just like the rnc or any other political organization and there was nothing released from the rnc because the people who work there are pure as the driven snow right
technology,not_removed,ive yet to see anything remotely interesting in the dnc emails so fucking boring so boring in fact that the altright has to find coded language in them lol trumps tax returns now those would be interesting
technology,not_removed,they hacked one of our major political organizations to order to influence the outcome of the election does that make it seem better to you
technology,not_removed,this is such a stupid argument you know over the years the usa has dropped a shit ton of bombs on other countries if some foreign actor dropped a bomb on washington tomorrow you think we should just go oh well fair is fair
technology,not_removed,how is it hypocrisy was i the one doing the meddling
technology,not_removed,usually they are more central to left leaning which makes this story more believable to me at least its good to see straight up news
technology,not_removed,a person cant just come spouting bs here youre doing a pretty good job of it right now
technology,not_removed,okay upstulovescrackk did you read it can you look like a bigger person and provide a breakdown of the article you wont the report which was jointly published thursday by the department of homeland security and the fbi billed itself as an indictment of sorts that would finally lay out the intelligence communitys case that russian government operatives carried out hacks on the democratic national committee the democratic congressional campaign committee and clinton campaign chief john podesta and leaked much of the resulting material terrible sentence structure and poorly written while security companies in the private sector have said for months the hacking campaign was the work of people working for the russian government anonymous people tied to the leaks have claimed they are lone wolves repetition of people sounds terrible in this one many independent security experts said there was little way to know the true origins of the attacks who can we see some names this is a crappy sentence and its unsourced sadly the jar as the joint analysis report is called does little to end the debate this is atrocious still its hard to escape the conclusion that thursdays joint analysis report provides almost no new evidence to support the obama administrations claims russia attempted to interfere with the us electoral process absent something more the increasingly bitter debate may rage on indefinitely ends on another poorly written sentence
technology,not_removed,deleted
technology,not_removed,its just sad that the dems ripped trump about not accepting defeat and then they pull all this shit its actually funny to watch
technology,not_removed,i think that is clearly a lie from what i remember of that it guy saying that he used a legit email if he meant illegitimate he would have aid an illegitimate do you think he really bad two huge typos
technology,not_removed,trumps transgressions dont clear clinton of wrongdoings though i would agree that trumps actions are way bigger concerns now that he is one to be sworn in
technology,not_removed,how about how hillary took donations from saudi arabia and other foreign powers also appointed top donors to ambassador positions
technology,not_removed,yeahlets all hate russia because the government told us to arent you sick of the government inventing enemies just so we can continue spending trillions of dollars dropping bombs
technology,not_removed,member when wikileaks exposed the corruption coming from the bushes back in the day when dems praised wikileaks
technology,not_removed,hes said multiple times as soon as the audit is over he will release his tax returns also look into how much money is actually going to charity from the clinton foundation and why the irs is investigating it let alone the fact that chelsea used foundation money on her wedding
technology,not_removed,whatever the hacker wanted to rig heshe definitely worked less hard than the interim chairwomen of dnc i am just surprised that she walked away from it like an innocent girlmeanwhile this russian thing jumps out again and again
technology,not_removed,they exposed corruption and the corrupt would really like to be able to point the finger anywhere but themselves literally pay no attention to the man behind the curtain
technology,not_removed,if the bomb killed a bunch of democrats theyd praise the bomber
technology,not_removed,so what your saying is its ok as long as its america meddling in others elections but not when someone new with ours
technology,not_removed,youre supporting the argument that it is a bad thing to influence a foreign election while defending a state that has done this openly forever thats called hypocrisy
technology,not_removed,most hated candidate more citizens voted for her than trump so i wouldnt say she was the most hated candidate
technology,not_removed,i see a long history of being a shill and a asshole but that is btp mods i know this is harsh please check their history unshockingly it did not take me long to find this i dont give a fuck about what happens next the dem establishment forced this situation and they didnt have to fuck it yolo you are not a friend of america
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,when trump was asked for his tax returns he said he would release them if clinton released her deleted emails when trump knew he would be asked about the pussy tape he brought in bill clintons sexual assault accusers as props i really dont see why i have to hold myself to a higher standard of discourse than our next president
technology,not_removed,trump just announced billion dollars of softbank which is half saudi buying up american tech if thats ok then maybe its ok to spend saudi money on hiv meds for kids also not for nothing saudi prince alwaleed has bailed out trump twice for big league money
technology,not_removed,so in your estimation hacking a political organization and releasing what amounts to mean girl insider gossip is the same as exposing actual corruption inside the executive branch
technology,not_removed,the election is over and hillary lost trump is the peotus hillary is irrelevant now and the but what about hillary arguments need to stop trump is never going to release his tax returns because nobody is making him theres nothing stopping him from doing it any time he wants
technology,not_removed,and you believe him oh boy i guess he can claim hell release his filings after one or excuse or another and you and others like can continue to beleive he will youll be wrong but youll always have hope
technology,not_removed,the cia doesnt get to choose whether to use military force
technology,not_removed,yes the syria situation is a giant clusterfuck im not sure how thats relevant to this conversation
technology,not_removed,no they didnt
technology,not_removed,im pretty sure i didnt say that
technology,not_removed,this exactly theres even proof of hilary bragging about tampering with other elections
technology,not_removed,lol so by saying its bad that anyone is influencing elections im being hypocritical okay then bud
technology,not_removed,its happening people said children would look at the president and become bullies insidious i tells ya edit clearly one person missed the joke
technology,not_removed,theres been a lot of corruption brought out because of the dnc and podesta emails
technology,not_removed,my wife is of mexican descent and found the whole taco bowl pretty offensive ill let her know that making fun of the hispanic vote was just mean girl talk
technology,not_removed,trump is the peotus hillary is irrelevant now and the but what about hillary arguments need to stop they arent going to stop because some people are rightly concerned about how these emails got out and other people are rightly concerned with how much effort was spent in discrediting them for their source rather than validating or debunking their contents this whole thing including the amazing amount of egg on the face of all of the pollsters and pundits is going to be a topic of conversation for some time id rather we not try to memoryhole it until we get some clarity and ideally assurances we wont see a repeat in four years edit i lost track of the context of this thread yeah just jumping on but hillary on any critique of trump presented is dumb unless that critique was followed by so you should have voted hillary
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,no there hasnt
technology,not_removed,remember when she called black people super predators
technology,not_removed,this may shock you but sometimes people say offensive things in private conversations
technology,not_removed,im sorry your russian to english translation algorithm must be malfunctioning that just seems like word salad to me give it another go
technology,not_removed,member how the head of the dnc was forced to step down because she rigged the primaries against bernie yeah thats not corruption it is
technology,not_removed,doesnt make you any less racist anything else
technology,not_removed,no i dont remember anything like that i think you are confused
technology,not_removed,id say that people who say racist things in private are somewhat less racist than people who say them in public but your mileage may vary
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,nothing in there about the election being rigged
technology,not_removed,man its almost like you dont know how to use google
technology,not_removed,its almost like you dont know how to actually read
technology,not_removed,and i quote from the first fucking paragraph democrats arrived at their nominating convention on sunday under a cloud of discord as debbie wasserman schultz the chairwoman of the democratic national committee abruptly said she was resigning after a trove of leaked emails showed party officials conspiring to sabotage the campaign of senator bernie sanders of vermont
technology,not_removed,they conspired but theres no proof they actually did anything in the end it was all talk you cant rig an election with idle chatter also more typical shit from the new york times
technology,not_removed,in that sense you cant rig an election with emails
technology,not_removed,what evidence would be good enough for you
technology,not_removed,dammit western democracies get your shit together n korea is decades ahead of you in controlling the information their citizens can access
technology,not_removed,oh good grief
technology,not_removed,people need to stop being able to find things
technology,not_removed,wow thats not subtle at all its almost like they want to legitimize the terrorists message that muslim culture and teaching are being suppressed by the west
technology,not_removed,tbhive never wanted anything banned off the net as a black guyi didnt even care about stormfront or other stuff but i am dangerously comfortable with banning islamic extremismi damn near want islam itself hard to find
technology,not_removed,downvoted for giving an honest comment fuck you redditors
technology,not_removed,then youre more dangerous than the terrorists
technology,not_removed,have fun holding that crown for a few days nov samsung pro drive thats twice the speed
technology,not_removed,also be aware that sequential read and write speeds the ones that all marketing agents use to sell ssds arent very representative of real world performance these numbers are also promptly used in the article while yes faster sequential reads and writes are often linked with better random reads or writes the ones that actually matter for real world speeds i generally am still comfortable saying that most users are fine with any ahci ssd for a while only professional users that make money with their systems can benefit from the more expensive nvme ssds because it allows those to work a bit faster when time is money it does make sense just wanted to point this out i doubt that most users care about the fact that their laptops or pcs start up in seconds compared to
technology,not_removed,that you cant plug anything into
technology,not_removed,and its
technology,not_removed,microsoft has stressed that the telemetry benefits users as if theyd ever say anything else
technology,not_removed,there is no good in the news being fake because it is fake lets assume no malice and that the author was simply lazy an idiot or both this news should never have been posted in the first place because it is factually incorrect its not a minor fact correctable by a minor change the entire premise is incorrect
technology,not_removed,for me the critical change has been the loss of the sd card slot how are you supposed to get footage from your camera onto the laptop
technology,not_removed,hmm if we make this product the sameworse than the last one the next one will looking effing amazing
technology,not_removed,this is actually a really good article those who came straight to the comments read the article
technology,not_removed,i think if youre looking at a pc why would you buy a pc anymore no really why would you buy one this was hard to read
technology,not_removed,i surely hope ditching the functionkeys for a touch display isnt something that will become a trend and spread to proper computers adding a touch display above the physical keys would be another thing
technology,not_removed,no sd card wait they dont have an sd card damn now i cant fathom why any photographer would want to use the new mbp
technology,not_removed,its only when you see a company like apple very slowly make the wrong decisions year on year that you realise how pivotal a man like jobss was
technology,not_removed,seriously though has everyone gone insane i dont want to be that what the fuck guy but what the actual fuck
technology,not_removed,why remove the hdmi port a standard thats still incredibly popular for plugging into tvs they lost a large percentage of the market right there i have to have an hdmi port for my television
technology,not_removed,i genuinely cannot believe you cant plug your iphone ipod ipad in to your brand new mac thats just ridiculous its making me question the point of the lightning port i mean what was it designed for if apple had lightning to lightning cables from their charging bricks to the devices they could up to usb type c levels of power to help charge devices faster however they havent done that at the end of every lightning cable is usb i dont even get apple now in when they had a mac pro with xeon processors support for hard drives and ram thats when they made sense thats where the clear distinction was made between consumer and professional markets especially considering macs and macbooks at the time had of memory as standard
technology,not_removed,built for appearance over functionality
technology,not_removed,macbook air is dead which is good macbook air was literally the only reason ive ever been interested in mac laptops
technology,not_removed,lets check in months from now
technology,not_removed,just the sheer balls to call anything pro you cant even expand with more memory or storage or easily replace the battery on so you can keep proing when it runs dry this is not a macbook pro this is a nextgeneration macbook air there is no pro plus the whole dj thing what dj uses his pc to mix on at all the software and the display is on the pc but the dj works on something like a not the computer whatever silly hobby dj stuff they showed on stage has no relevance a serious dj has a controller connected to software like traktor pro the computer does the work but the controls are analog
technology,not_removed,i dj with serato there is no way i would use that touch bar when the screen has all the action my controller has its own touch bar which is far more useful
technology,not_removed,it just goes to show that no matter what companies that get big and fat become complacent if youre a cable company well youre in luck because you have no competition but its incredible to see apple a scrappy company in the who basically almost went under and only had a niche following explode as the goto tech brand for the mainstream consumer i was and still am a hardcore pc fan but i always respected apple because they never wavered in their mission to be different always take a different approach and be fervently nonpc but they did it because they felt pc was the wrong way and in some ways back then they had a point except for their processors before they used intel apple had horrible processors but they had a lot of other good things about them in only years they became what their original fans hated a bloated overconfident company making things that dont actually help people and are bought only because theyre popular theyre now officially overpriced it used to be you could make the argument that creative professionals need macs for the stuff they do but we now know a pc can handle video and photo editingartistry software just as well its been a weird years for apple
technology,not_removed,i suspect apple no longer cares they are just happy shifting units and making profit than pleasing their long time customers im sick of their highly restrictive ecosystem their neglect for prosumer crowd and their blatant disregard of their competitors they are simply banking on their brand name for sales they dont care about innovation anymore ive stopped supporting them around the time they dropped aperture it became clear around things have peaked and the only way was down once i removed myself from apple you start to see the pretentiousness of it all it became so hard to defend the overpriced hardware their os and the hoards of clueless consumers who buy into the brand for its image rather than its functionality i think in the past years or so good portion of the target audience for apple have wised up and have moved on why continue to invest in apple when you can get same or better functionalityperformance for windows based systems for less if anyone is seriously defending apple at this point you know they are either blind fanboy or salty for being duped into buying their products
technology,not_removed,apple without steve jobs is like manchester united without alex ferguson
technology,not_removed,as of now its for suckers
technology,not_removed,cause the answer would insult their customers
technology,not_removed,to respond to tim cooks why would you buy a pc my answer is that i prefer hardware thats up to date instead of hardware from you can be seriously be paying for such a masterpiece
technology,not_removed,their mobile side is their main concern at this point which is honestly sad i love my mac but i see these surface machines get better each year with software in mind and macos has just been this stale thing almost in all honesty i wish they would have swapped the headphone jack with a micro sd card slot on these new laptops
technology,not_removed,my opinion on the headphone jack situation is this the only reason apple purchased beats was for the name and the market share they probably thought that the beats brand had enough weight to move the industry toward a wireless apple dongle infested future but it wasnt
technology,not_removed,i love mac os x and the laptops to beat are still the unibody mbps up to the first retinas imho the design was so well thought out and there was a feeling of true synergy between the hardware and software the new laptops from apple have me reluctantly looking elsewhere it hurts looking at the hp spectre or the surface pro but apple just doesnt make the cut magsafe was the best power interfacewhyd they move away from it why are all the pro interfaces gone where the hell is that cool led light strip that gave you a quick readout of battery life in addition desktops are in sore need of at least a refresh i was hoping for some updates to at least some internals but no attention was given its like apple is trying to kill its non mobile line youwerethechosenonejpg
technology,not_removed,apologies for length ive been a mac user since i first got an lcii running system for cubase in glorious monochrome i then went to a power pc quicksilver and now use an imac my wife daughter and i all use iphones ipads and have had just about every version of the ipod ever released my daughter started university this year and was in the market for a laptop she needed something for her university work but that could also handle a game or two for when shes got some spare time on her hands we waited for the macbook pro event we then went and bought a shudders dell its an expandable hybrid drive decent dedicated graphics card with graphics memory display loads of ports its well constructed but definitely not beautiful it cost £ i need a new laptop and have found myself looking at the razer stealth linked to in this very article my point here is apple have priced me out of their laptop lineup its not even worth me saving a bit longer because theres no benefit in doing so so i possibly get a windows laptop i quite like win i already have a windows pc which i built rather than buy an xbox or but its used solely for gaming then i need a new phone well ive switched to windows so whats stopping me trying a different phone too i also need a new tablet since a cupboard jar gravity ipad screen related incident in the store buying my daughters laptop i played with a surface pro i was incredibly impressed i can genuinely see myself switching which is something i never thought id say unless apple regroups and starts thinking as one single company again i can see them losing a lot more customers than just me and my handful of devices
technology,not_removed,their end game is pretty obvious i think along with their partnership with ibm and their business cloud backed they are chasing corporate users with large order contracts and year refreshes the updated mac isnt suitable for the heavy graphics virtual reality or work its so famous for being good at they havnt been able to compete here on power with pcs for a long time dont forget pcs still have a robust gaming community that drives development of newer and faster chips that are recycled for use in graphics and creatives apple long ago signaled they were unable or unwilling to keep up with this segment of the market it is also likely not profitable comparatively apples biggest success is with mass market consumer goods the creatives thing is legacy
technology,not_removed,fuck i wish elon musk would start building computers
technology,not_removed,so ive have pc for all my life but switched to macbook pro a few years ago im very happy with it but im pretty sure this will be my last apple computer i just cant see where they are going with their new series
technology,not_removed,jobs was visionary maybe not in terms of inventing but surely in foreseeing whats the next big thing cook is just an ordinary ceo who loves economic statistics without passion for technology
technology,not_removed,it wants the market that sits in coffee shops with its brand and only buys apple but doesnt mind so much if the core demographic disappears sorry bud but that is the core demographic os x in the early part of the century was awesome and it almost made you want to spend an extra grand to buy a powerbookmacbook pro but those days came and went the ios era begun and no more jobs to cutthroat something people want theres nothing there anymore to make you want to own an apple product other than people that like the name
technology,not_removed,let me design the macbook pro first off i would make it matte black next up usb c is great but the stupid iphone uses lightning so include a few lightning ports and a few usb c professionals need the headphone jack leave it there bring back magsafe it was a fuck up to get rid of that it has saved my laptop multiple times magsafe usb c simple enough should have had a minimum of ram with ram option minimum ssd and up dedicated graphics that arent intel the touch bar seems useless what can it do that cant be done on screen i would rather further refine osx know what i hate about os x look at windows clocktime it has a calendar it can have multiple timezone clocksworld clocks i would copy that for osx better sound options where i can set different volumes for different tones in the os itself and not app controlled double the size of the battery that would make me happy
technology,not_removed,as a photographer the biggest thing that made me buy a macbook pro was the fact i could plug an sd card straight into it and work on the go having the laptop and iphone and an imac at home i am well in the apple ecosystem and super happy with it because everything just works for me as of now but after seeing this new macbook i question how long this is going to last eventually ill need a new laptop and if the future of the pros are going to be so stripped down of the things that are key to my workflow then ill have no choice but scrap my current system and find a better solution but i really do not want to have to do that
technology,not_removed,the big mistake was not having usb c on the latest phone
technology,not_removed,apples customers are those that need powerful machines not once have i gotten that feeling edit guys i know that content creators and programmers use macbooks a lot what im saying is that almost everyone i see with a macbook pro is some hipster at starbucks or a college student that has it because its better
technology,not_removed,i am in the market for a laptop ive been a ubuntu user for years and was toying with the idea of switching to mac rather than buying another windows machine and installing ubuntu as a dual boot i just havent been convinced enough to pull the trigger at that price point so i was waiting for the new models now im convinced ubuntu on a new laptop it is
technology,not_removed,ok apple im done hey reddit whats a good looking reasonably lightweight laptop that will run nix lets me add up to ram and has one or more hdmi connectors and possibly some usbc connectors battery life doesnt have to be great id just prefer that it doesnt look like a space ship a keyboard with proper arrow keys and no i prefer to be centered with my keyboard and screen is a must edit looks like dell xps fits the bill nicely anyone have goodbad experience with this line
technology,not_removed,the best part of this is that the is going down in price so you can get a good phone with a headphone jack for like compared to the lowest starting price being at launch
technology,not_removed,yep i was going to consider doubling down on mac get a new mac laptop to replace my aging mac deal with shit i didnt like about the new iphone and stay that course as well having the iphone currently and having owned a and previously now im aimlessly looking to other product manufacturers considering google pixel as my next phone and going back to the pc route
technology,not_removed,sure they do its the same crowd who buy glasses with no lenses in
technology,not_removed,in much the same way that starbucks makes coffee for people that dont like coffee apple makes computers for people that dont like computers
technology,not_removed,theyre shooting themselves in the foot i remember being upset that my macbook didnt have a record input like my previous one did but this is just ridiculous i really like apple products but after this theyve left a bad taste in my mouth next computer will most likely be a pc and next mobile will not be an iphone
technology,not_removed,meanwhile last week microsoft announced their content creators patch for windows apparently they are going after the market that apple just dropped
technology,not_removed,well there goes my apple stock
technology,not_removed,whyd they keep the headphone jack i thought it was obsolete
technology,not_removed,for me the pro machines died when they integrated the ram and ssd into the motherboard i dont expect upgradable graphics in a laptop anymore but i have needed to upgrade the ram and graphics in literally every laptop ive owned at some point pro machines are supposed to be for people that want to actually do stuff with their computers and apples made a toy for college students that just care about instagram or whatever highlighting the messenger functionality seriously i just bought a slightly used mbp even though it was sold to some poor sap in for and i hope it lasts another years i did the ssdhdd upgrade and its lighting fast its got and an se card slot if apple doesnt get their shit together it will be the last mac i own which is a sad sad thing at the same time ill be stretching my iphone to its limits and not upgrade to ios because it seems like their mobile platforms are going to shit too itunes has been getting worse for years now this is what happens when you start making changes for the sake of making changes instead of designing for a purpose
technology,not_removed,apple has just released their vista
technology,not_removed,apple has been at the top for so long now the only way is down
technology,not_removed,well i dont know why people still care about apple they dont care about you as customer as always they always want you to understand them and their stupid products
technology,not_removed,i think they keep the headphone jack on the macbook pro is because professionals still need to use headphones
technology,not_removed,apple has done one good thing make the iphone thank them for this then go buy pcandroid
technology,not_removed,what do you mean the donglebook pro is for everyone lol first time ever ive turned down a computer upgrade from my company ill stick to my old macbook pro id feel rather handicap with this new crapbook pro so the million dollar question should i stick with calling it a crapbook pro or the donglebook pro
technology,not_removed,something is happening in the us that i cant grasp first trump and hillary now apple
technology,not_removed,why cant you plug the lightning headphones that come in the iphone box into the new mac wait what so let me get this straight if you buy into apples bullshit and get a seven with the new headphones you cant use those headphones on the new mac book pro how do you fuck something like that up this isnt blind apple hate i just dont understand what their message to consumers is it reminds me of microsoft and their launch of the xbox one no clear understanding of who the market is what they wanted and an attempt to force proprietary hardware on to people who didnt want it
technology,not_removed,apple is trying to push the market towards usbc which is fantastic but why they would push usbc and not have it on the iphone is beyond me thats where they fucked up and that is why this endeavor will ultimately fail also the hardware is so overpriced for what youre getting for an are you kidding me
technology,not_removed,apple it seems is angling for the amateur creative and isnt interested in anything else anymore it wants the market that sits in coffee shops with its brand and only buys apple but doesnt mind so much if the core demographic disappears maybe thats ok — theres probably good money in it — but its a real shame been saying this for years but wrt developers in the early days of osx apple appealed to developers osx was a solid bsd based os with nice guis and came with python and ruby preinstalled there was textmate macvim and homebrew then things started to get sloppy apple avoided upgrading their base system the versions of python ruby bash openssl became woefully out of date compared to what other linux distros offered forcing developers to install newer versions via homebrew xcode updates would break the developers environment forcing them to search stackoverflow for workarounds something linux users normally did now finally apple has removed the esc key a key that is heavily used by developers who use the vim text editor and for what to make room for a gimmicky touch bar apple no longer cares about developers they are focusing on the much larger and lucrative demographic of amateur creatives and home users
technology,not_removed,ill probably get downvoted but ill say it anyways reddit users never seem to realize that your average consumer doesnt care if apple removes certain ports from their devices i have layman friends who have already purchased iphone the lack of headphone port didnt matter to them they use the earpods that came with their iphone the lack of usb type a ports wont matter either every accessory will be usb type c in years and apples laptops will continue to be used in every coffee shop in america youre the same people that made fun of the macbook air and it continues to be one of the most popular laptops ever created
technology,not_removed,apple is doing its best to drive all segments of the market away the only reason it still has any market share is because its devices are viewed as luxury items with a higher status symbol then others
technology,not_removed,i have a macbook pro from and its still going strong a computer should last more than years so that isnt a reason to switch the real reason people buy a new mac every years is to use it as a fashion accessory in that case the new mac is the perfect machine beautiful design and a good brand name
technology,not_removed,apples customers are those that need powerful machines how do you come to this conclusion sure creatives need machines with ram and processing power and the bigger macs could deliver a fair amount but first and foremost you always at any time got more power more ram and better raw specs with any other os windows or linux anything that lets you build or buy customized gear by far the more fitting term would be apple customers are those that need a good share of power in an approachable and easy to use package that was the main selling point people could use a mac like a pencil or ruler they didnt need to know how one was build they could just take it and use it not all creatives like to be computerrepairmen aswell the tradeoff was you paid a hefty fee for that but never get the best for it
technology,not_removed,the size of the macbook is perhaps the most compelling component what no the fuck it isnt power users dont give a flying shit if its thinner than the last mbp make it the same hell make it thicker and give me hours of battery life more ports every port put usb ports on it put two hdmi ports and a dvi port on it put the damn sd slot back put the damn optical drive back put the damn magsafe port back that was one of apples few true innovations who gives a shit if its the thinnest this is a macbook pro not a goddamn ipad fuck you apple i have two generations of mbp an imac and two generations of mac mini but ill never buy a computer from you idiots again looking good is great but working well is a deal breaker i will take an uglybycomparison plastic pc laptop that does everything i want it to over a beautifully useless macbook pro
technology,not_removed,its a status symbol
technology,not_removed,thats easyits for the technologically challenged man or woman who has too much money in their bank account
technology,not_removed,ive had a mbp thats finally gone on the fritz best computer ive ever owned upgraded the ram once replaced the hard drive and power connector but otherwise a great computer naturally was going to upgrade to the latest mbp but im not convinced so what should i get instead
technology,not_removed,mobile developer here i have two souped up macbook pros jobs they are years old now and are still excellent but this whole think makes me worried for if and when something happens to them im not impressed at all with this line of replacements ill have even more adapters to carry around with me the ram is the biggest hit it has a real effect on compiling code time this whole thing feels like a step back
technology,not_removed,people will still buy it just like the iphone apple has more or less coached people into thinking their products are the best those people dont even bother looking at other products
technology,not_removed,i loved loved loved my inch macbook pro despite it costing an arm and a leg it was awesome i loved using it to code last year i got a newer inch macbook and its ok osx used to provide a nice balance of nix os with a little bit mroe refinement than your typically linux distro along with top of the line hardware but thats no longer the case i think the serious programmer now probably should just run linux if they werent already and i think in a year or windows might be better as well depending on how their bash support comes along microsoft has already started to show they are doing more innovative things in the hardware space apple is definitely having an identity crisis
technology,not_removed,i agree that their mbp line has gotten worse and worse each era i dont know why they think its a good idea to keep stripping functions and sacrificing power from the pro line i have a mbp ipad and mac mini all are ranging between years in age on the bright side they all work relatively fine i have no desire to buy a new mac computer dongles breakout cables and adapters are my greatest pet peeve and seeing as everybodys not aboard the usbc train yet i have no interest in upgrading there and then having adaptors on my desk to do things hdmi usb fw from a marketing pov i bet theyre doing the right thing though year olds getting their first personal laptop dont really give a crap about pro audiovideo usb and fw devices nor sd cards the largest market of adult users isnt nerds anymore its the corporatewhitecollar trying to be trendy and all they do is send emails facebook use the calendar and ms office so i actually get it whats wrong with just getting an older mbp in excellent condition and upgrading some of the specs batteries and ram are readily available
technology,not_removed,i have a macbook pro from and its still going strong doesnt sound right that you can use the phrase still going strong for a computer not even years old
technology,not_removed,why would anyone buy a new mac at that price point when a pc andor surface blows it away at the same price
technology,not_removed,i think youre all missing the point its thinner
technology,not_removed,as a big supporter of windows based pcs it saddens even me to see apple doing the tasteless and uninventive things they are apple used be the comparable highendonly philosophical opposite of the more versatile windows platform and it was really fun to compare the two but today apple just seems to be overdoing their minimalist philosophy and forgetting that performance and ecosystem are while maybe taken for granted nowadays very important to the user to the detriment of not just their fans but more importantly the whole computing industry
technology,not_removed,everyone shit on apple when they got rid of the floppy everyone shit on apple when they got rid of cdrom drives everyone has shit on apple for major changes that preceded the industry by years however i cant think of a reason to buy these laptops i am an os x guy and my last three or four laptops have been mbps ive paid exorbitant prices to get the higherend laptops but ive noticed fewer ports fewer features and a marked lack of connectivity with businesses who use hdmi or vga projectors for example im slowly getting pushed to windows laptops for the simple reason that the value proposition isnt there for me i like the fact that i can charge the macbook on anything with a usbc cable which means no more dragging a charger with me at the same time a paucity of usbc ports in the name of making it everthinner the lack of repairability the increasing need to buy peripherals for functionality its all kind of ruining the experience im just getting frustrated at paying more for increasingly less i dont need a lighter thinner laptop what i need is a laptop with enough ports and good battery life this is not what i want apple give me what i want im paying more than any other laptop on the market give me a better laptop or watch me leave for a manufacturer that charges less and provides more hello lenovo also pertinent can anyone suggest a windows laptop manufacturer that offers a similar product besides lenovo
technology,not_removed,i got a macbook pro for my last job after having been a pc guy all my life coworkers were telling me how it would change my life how the macbook never freezes how it always starts up easier to give presentations etc none of what they said was true its an illusion my mac is constantly heating up it freezes its not made for office which always locks up when i have a few spreadsheets open battery life is not great yes it has some cool features but not enough for me to ever think of getting one for myself its too expensive compared to what is out there
technology,not_removed,i feel like some of this is being lost in the boy who cried wolf no company has released more products than apple over the years with people complaining at each release along the way these are now actually getting bit ridiculous
technology,not_removed,by offering a flexible set of ports the macbook is whatever you want it to be isnt it at least thats what they seemed to demonstrate during the announcement
technology,not_removed,and apparently they removed the iconical startup gongchime they really lost it
technology,not_removed,you are looking at the stars
technology,not_removed,this is the beginning of the beginning of the second downfall of apple
technology,not_removed,tim cook has no idea what hes doing
technology,not_removed,dongles out for stevejobs maybe i should hashtag this for the twits donglesoutforstevejobs
technology,not_removed,i can help them out its for people who buy them they are generally not computer savvy buy it for its aesthetics use it for basic operations and think theyre better than everyone because they spend at least three times the cash on their computer
technology,not_removed,apple better have jobs in a cryochamber somewhere its history repeating
technology,not_removed,it is for idiots who would pay double more just for their branding expenses
technology,not_removed,apple pay twice as much for half the power all because its fashionable
technology,not_removed,it has two less ports what the hell medium it has two fewer ports
technology,not_removed,the only apple product i own is the ipod i just bought my second one after the original ipod with video broke two years ago i wont buy anything else from apple probably it seems like a self mutilating company now
technology,not_removed,i wonder if jony ive is driving a lot of these silly design decisions and theres no one to tell him no or if theyre being made by committee and theyre trotting ive out to make it seem like theres a method to the madness
technology,not_removed,how far has the apple fallen from its ideological tree quite a bit it seems
technology,not_removed,look im really looking for alternatives to replace my heavyass mbp the dell xps for example looks really interesting but can dell or hp lenovo razer guarantee a similar support that apple has ive had several problems with my laptop but apple managed to fix it at the local apple store within a few days also macbooks are incredibly sturdy the keyboards and touchpads have always been top notch havent tried the butterfly switches yet though are laptops like the xps or hp spectre as sturdy one of the reasons im tempted to buy the new macbook is because i need to be sure that i dont have to waste hours dealing with crappy support andor badly engineered products i dont know how much time my family has wasted by buying lenovo and hp laptops several thinkpads hinges broke my fathers hp laptop had a broken motherboard on arrival dont even get me started on shady software that are installed by default i really dont have the time to deal with shit like that
technology,not_removed,ive said it before and ill say it again everything in their lineup is an iphone accessory i really wanted to get out of my hackintosh and back into a mac at some point but its looking less and less possible as the days go by
technology,not_removed,what the hell is the touch bar supposed to improve comparing the macbook pro with and without and theres a big price for something i cant see a real purpose for id pay that price for a touch screen but not a pointless gizmo i guess failure is instructive and apples in need just now
technology,not_removed,i dont really want to apple jerk since i own a large family of apple products but this is pathetic and makes me want to get off the apple bandwagon okay it might be a bit more technical but being a dj i would never use such a thing to mixin my eyes its pointless and in terms of functionality it would give me the same results as my hp touch function bar did all those years ago
technology,not_removed,i wouldnt call the touch bar a gimmick if it had touch and pencil as well but without those it looks pathetic i had so much hope for tim cooks apple when the macpro was announced powerful innovative and exciting just looking at it was inspiring it was apple showing it still cares about professionals years later and all we have had is a slew of stale iterations across its product range the most exciting thing has been the apple watch hardly reassuring
technology,not_removed,the next iphone better use usbc
technology,not_removed,the only difference is one doesnt have the touch strip but why not just call it the new macbook air to alleviate confusion because thriving on gullibility and thinking youre buying the good thing is an apple mo
technology,not_removed,who it is for answeryoutubers who can post shit everyday
technology,not_removed,so i am out of the loop why is the macbook air dead and why is that good news
technology,not_removed,for people who want to buy a laptop
technology,not_removed,its for people who are either clueless about computers or want to show off their money
technology,not_removed,as a mac user for nearly the past decade that surface studio is so beautiful it makes me want to cry
technology,not_removed,this article is dead on ive loved macs for years but im looking for alternatives now
technology,not_removed,yr old mac and apple enthusiast ive seen a lot with the company over the years im beyond speechless at what apple is doing right now even if this is a transition period to wirelessother technologies it appears botched in a manner that is inconceivable to me
technology,not_removed,apple does have a history of being the goto machine for creative professionals its weird though that they persisted for so long under the banner of programmers if you look at the design decisions that steve jobs has constantly pushed ever since the apple closed systems little to no expansion capabilities etc you would know that the higher end machines that could be expanded were a very niche market im looking at the mac pro web page right now and for all i remember of the talk of its expandability it is a closed system apple has never been for computer people and none of us should be surprised at the fact that they are not acting like computer people for a very long time the only qualifiable reason to say i use a mac because i am a programmer is because you had to use a mac in order to develop for ios im not sure if that is the case anymore but i keep my macbook pro around just in case i decided to make something for ios beyond that the creative market for apple has been a feedback loop an echo chamber it has been a very long time since apple was better than pc for things like photoshop etc the continued cult of mac in the creative world really comes down to i learned on mac so its what i know and until a major shift occurs it will continue to be macs all the way down because each new subsequent generation of professional who learns the systems in a formal educational environment will be learning from people who learned from people who learned on mac
technology,not_removed,it really feels like there was no collaboration between the iphone and macbook teams they feel like two devices from two different companies i was really ok with the iphone changes but now im really questioning how much longer ill be an apple user the one thing that i foresee keeping me on apple for the next years is likely nothinmore than the sunken cost fallacy android really is looking better every day
technology,not_removed,not only do they not know who the mac is for they have seem to no idea who the competitor for the mac is as well
technology,not_removed,macs are now for rich customers with only superficial computer usage and care mostly about following a brand
technology,not_removed,the company didnt really deliver any real futurevalue other than its new cant really blame them for thinking this would work considering theyve been doing this with the iphone for years and people gobbled that shit up every time
technology,not_removed,when it talks about djing they are very far off the mark im sure some people dj without any form of hardware but ive never seen it not live not practicing not in the bedroom sono i dont see any use for that other then maybe if youre playing about on a train or plane i have messed aboutbwith tracktor on the eurostar a few times but cant say the touchbar would make any difference to that in reacrion to phils comment on why would anyone buy a pcreally if he honestly belives that hes so far up his own arse he cant see anything around him ill give you a starter for gaming computers yes there are games on osx and ipads but if you want a gaming computer you dont buy an ipad
technology,not_removed,apple sort of pigeonholed themselves by their decisions touch is only for ios this is a horrible decision and the surface laptop and desktop are clearly better content creation devices than any mac because of this their allergy to ports working with dongles is ridiculous and as a professional creative who takes quite a bit of photos i appreciate the integrated sd card reader in my dell precision all of this feels like the early apple missteps of old like the one button mouse that they held onto for far too long
technology,not_removed,compare this to the new surface studio and you have a very strange shift in brand ive grown up with the apple is for creative people line but this painted a completely different picture
technology,not_removed,macs arnt good to develop on they are just better then pure linux ifwhen microsoft really kicks their linux sub system into gear developers should flee in droves windows for all its faults feels like a much more mature os then osx ms knows how to do multi display file management multi tasking and on and on
technology,not_removed,that eink bar is going to be used to brand logo permanent advertisements i just know it
technology,not_removed,apple it just works as long as you buy all of the extra cables and components to make it work out of the box youre pretty much fucked
technology,not_removed,hipsters who want barely functional technology and a lot of dongles
technology,not_removed,ill take windows nowarning pc restart updates over this cable adapter mess
technology,not_removed,hipsters who cant afford a cup of coffee but love showing off their expensive apple toys
technology,not_removed,i think if youre looking at a pc why would you buy a pc anymore no really why would you buy one –tim cook i dunno tim you tell me
technology,not_removed,this is going to be a case study for what happens when you dont have marketing rd product engineering and product management all working together its like all of the musicians in a band playing a different genre they think theyre doing ok and everyone else is the reason it sounds shit the article has made so many good points about the entire package and apple in general
technology,not_removed,apple has always done stuff like this why is apple trying to corner customers such a big surprise litetally nothing changes
technology,not_removed,is the start of the end of apples reign im seeing way more criticism for their decisions than i expected im ready for some refreshing ideas in the market
technology,not_removed,and then you get this the new macbook pro looks and feels so good its unreal by dieter bohn
technology,not_removed,it certainly isnt for me
technology,not_removed,have you seen other laptops nothing really that great has come out in the last years moores law seems to not be holding up anymore laptops arent getting that much better year to year macbooks are no exception
technology,not_removed,if they were led by someone even faking brilliance theyd have customized their os and motherboards to let them disable ram chips apple you stuck with because of power consumption right so give yourselves the ability to empty out and then turn off areas of memory light usage active amazing battery life fulltilt maybe even and if the users doing computational fluid dynamics on battery power then thats their problem
technology,not_removed,i honestly dont know what will we do at my agency we got some new mac pros a few months ago but they were almost the same we have had for years whats next no more desktops i dont see changing the entire team to windows
technology,not_removed,at this point i wouldnt enter the walled garden if someone offered it for free
technology,not_removed,i could wear ive read this before ita apple doesnt care about the customers the new feature is a waste of time that no one will use apple didnt include enough got rid of and just gave a big middle finger to all the out there who will probably be totally screwed without no one will use rip if ive learned anything from apple product announcements its that we usually cant predict which of their decisions are stupid until after the product is actually out and in use havent missed the headphone port yet but have found the headphone adapter works with accessories that the built in port didntspecifically a lapel mic i bought for podcasting that had a harsh buzz on the internal port but is totally clean with the adapter
technology,not_removed,aaaaand apple is back to apple postjobsprejobs apple
technology,not_removed,apple had peaked in terms of their innovation so this was their solution to lower the consumer expectation when a new better model comes out in a few years people will flip their shit saying how much better it is than the current one by lowering production inventory with the knowledge that this wont sell as well as other models have in the past they can save money by only losing a marginal amount now and triple that lost revenue on their next gen mac through hype and a more defined target audience
technology,not_removed,jesus i always tried to stay away from apple in i got some bursary money from my high school and decided to get a macbook pro non retina since it had the cd drive and i could upgrade the hardrives myself i was going into a media program so it made sense to get a macbook love my macbook but all these newer ones has reminded me why i use to hate apple they claim they want a wireless future yet i need more chords just to use my keyboard and plug in my iphone i dont care how thin you can make a laptop i want something i can fixreplace parts my self and i want to be able to sync my music looks like im trying out a surface next ps apple i dont want to have to charge my fucking headphones
technology,not_removed,genuine question why do creatives need a mac
technology,not_removed,i posted this on a friends fb wall after they announced it it started with the macbook in a mini device i could see having only usb c though their competitors with similar thickness and weight managed usb a ports but only port completely destroys the ability to be productive with the machine without a large expensive adapter which negates the size and weight of such a small machine then the iphone the port is the standard end of story there are significant drawbacks to using bluetooth headphones and adapters are easily lost and broken the space issue isnt valid make the phone longer or thicker if you have to i havent heard a single person ask for them to remove the headphone jack or make it thinner but i always hear people who want day battery life now this macbook pro its clear they arent going to update the macbook air anymore similar to the ipad airs so after a year or so the air will go away and the base macbook pro is that is a shit ton of money when parents are shopping for a new laptop for their kid going to college whats it going to be the dell or a macbook pro i can see parents justifying the extra or so but not the price same goes for the hipster somethings most arent pulling in a ton of money when youre faced with product a that does the same as product b but at the price it makes it hard to go for it this of course isnt even considering the usb c issue its like apple is thinking its the year or something the fact is that there are very very few usb c devices on the market right now similar to there being very few firewire or thunderbolt devices on the market yes usb c will take off but when youre releasing a product in that you have only a handful of android phones and flash drives using usb c its not the right time i mean include usb c and usb a if you want but not everybody wants to carry around adapters for every single attachment they have this not only ruins the streamline machine that apple was trying to create but it also frustrates the users to no end pros want something that works not something that needs adapters to work the great example is pro photographers before you could take your sd card right after a shoot and plug it in now you need a usb c to usb a adapter and an sd card reader try doing this all on an economy plane tray table its a mess
technology,not_removed,i was an original apple fanboy i had a macintosh se with a mb hard drive i remember hypercard and i remember when the multifinder was the cutting edge of gui technology i also left after the power mac line sometime in the apple was working on things like the newton and generally seemingwell lost this kind of review is very reminiscent of that era when apple was putting out confusing products for confusing reasons someone needs to tell apple you dont need to come out with a technological breakthrough every six months just make the shit you already make better and when some opportunity arises in some area of technology go into it and do it well ive been samsung only since the i probably wont go back to apple but id like for them to make a great product
technology,not_removed,im surprised no one has mentioned the microsoft surface studio yet it looks like the system that mac pro users will really want to have in fact it looks like an apple product sleek lines minimalist ridiculously expensive but cool
technology,not_removed,touch screen on a keyboard seems bad i do animation and video editing all day do you know what i love about the multitude of keyboard shortcuts that i use i dont have to look at the keyboard to use them
technology,not_removed,just plug your camera into the usb po oh hands over dongle
technology,not_removed,apple clearly wants you to ditch your professional grade cameras and use your iphone for all your photo shoots and filming that way it all autosyncs to your icloud how can you turn down such convenience exactly you cant s edit spelling edit got a few professional photographers and filmmakers up in arms about this comment its just a joke theres no need to correct me on it good for apple that some of you are excited about a new laptop with the same hardware and new ports
technology,not_removed,with the new icamera which also has no sd card slot because sd card slots are dead and forces you to pay for icloud storage to be able to even think of using it professionally since they only give you free featuring the new iraw which is a compressed version of raw and defeats the purpose entirely but allows you to use the new iphoto to edit your pictures and it only works with iraw file types because jpg is dead
technology,not_removed,i use cf cards so ive always had to use a card reader
technology,not_removed,have you tried using courage
technology,not_removed,suddenly windows and vista make more sense
technology,not_removed,new cokecoke classic
technology,not_removed,you were right
technology,not_removed,legitimately a good article not too many of these around
technology,not_removed,the worst part is he was talking about the ipad pro when he was quoted saying that why would i use a pc instead of literally the most redundant piece of technology ever i can think of a few reasons i used to be such an apple fanboy but i really dislike the direction of their recent releases
technology,not_removed,tim cook said that
technology,not_removed,i was seriously expecting some compelling reason there as it is it says nothing i think if youre looking at shelter why would you need a shelter anymore no really why would you need a shelter and then he follows yes the ipad pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many many people they will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else other than their phones seriously thats incredibly short sighted even for common use and it sucks for a company to say this id much more appreciated if they said something like it may not be for everyone but if you want simplicity or whatever is awesome for their target audience than this is for you it shows you know your advantages and disadvantages you know your customers and you know how to create value for those specifically making it like an ostrich and sticking your head in the ground saying nothing else exists is stupid
technology,not_removed,i had blissfully forgotten that the ceo of apple literally said that in real life today i was reminded and now am sad all over again
technology,not_removed,some brands no longer include the escfn row at all and his trend worries me since i rely on them a lot especially for vim and video games
technology,not_removed,lenovo tried that with their thinkpads the proest of the pro laptops it did not go well they reversed that decision more or less immediately
technology,not_removed,my mbp still has the expresscard slot which i have an sd reader in and usb ports and firewire and ethernet and a screen although is outdated now good old days i still use it a lot
technology,not_removed,i feel like they let the iphone and mac ecosystems spread too far apart while their laptops are trying to be revolutionary eliminating all but usb c ports the iphone is dropping one of the best or at least most commonly utilised wired headset connectors but hampering itself with lightning cables rather than a usb c connector that i feel would have been a far more game changing thing not only would it mean that either end of a cable connects your iphone to your macbook it also makes the devices look more similar together and suddenly peripherals come out with native usb c connectors that other systems can utilise
technology,not_removed,you can keep the old mac to connect your iphone and have the new mac for cafes apple
technology,not_removed,relevant
technology,not_removed,no more jobs
technology,not_removed,honestly it seems like apple is just really disjointed and floundering right now i wouldnt be surprised that without jobs there isnt a strong enough central leadership figure to hold the whole company together and make sure all of the products cohesively work together
technology,not_removed,the good news is theres finally a modern mac available even if there are some small compromises and there it is an entire article talking about how this new mbp isnt really new or exciting doesnt have the features you want or need and doesnt even really make sensebut people will buy it anyway because the good news is that apple has a new thingy
technology,not_removed,i think apple is going through a confused phase right now shortly after jobs passed away it was commonly thought that he had left behind plans for the company which would theoretically guide it for the next few years perhaps now those plans have run out and theyre feeling pressured to innovate but they have no clue what theyre doing the iphone headphone jack thing was a really stupid move in theory it might have been good for the bluetooth headphone market but apple arent really historically known for innovating by making weird moves like that if i were a betting man id wager that the trs jack is going to make a return to iphone in or models theres no way that apple doesnt realize how many people are upset over that decision hell i rarely ever use the trs jack on my smartphone but i just bought a new iphone today and got the for the simple fact that i may need it at some point and that adapter thing is just silly that like pretty much everything they just did with the mbp lineup is extremely bizarre its as if they dont know how people actually use any of their products they cant shit the bed too many more times before people start leaving en masse but its getting a little sketchy for folks like myself who are really attached to os x
technology,not_removed,disclaimer im definitely not a fan of the new stuff however me coming from trying to understand it theres probably quite a bit of push toward integrating through the cloud since user data is incredibly valuable having a lot of backups as data is compelling as a company it may well be anonymized but seems like everyone needs their next neuro net or object detection or whatever i was talking to my family and a few friends about the lack of iphone to mac connection and we realized that none of us have plugged in our phone in probably a year again i think the out of the box inability to connect them is total crap but for the average person out there eg not all of us on tech reddit and hn it may not really matter
technology,not_removed,what apple was known for was having a cohesive ecosystem that had the best hardware on the market the only thing apple had the best of was pclaptop monitors all the other hardware was either on or below par with the competition at the same price points
technology,not_removed,this the single thing that jobs did to stop apple from going out of business was cutting all the unnecessary products they were making way too much crap and their line of products became convoluted i believe if i remember correctly jobs was against the ipad mini for just this reason the second he dies bam ipad ipad mini ipad pro ipad keyboard ipad pen iphones etc
technology,not_removed,jobs may have set them straight before he died but that only lasted a year or two and apple has drifted way off course since jobs what has apple done theyve made products like apple tv and the apple watch that are only successful because theyre apple products not because theyre the best at what they do theyve also made siri which ive never seen anyone use in public although they might use it in their cars or at home like people do with cortana or google i cant believe jobs would sit by and let apple sell something like the apple watch if it was less useful than a pebble imagine what jobs would do if he saw the surface studio debut before apple announced this joke of a pro laptop
technology,not_removed,theres a reason hes a great person in civ
technology,not_removed,people knock jobs because he never actually designed or created the product but he had vision and knew what experience people were looking for he was just an amazing innovative leader i think of this quote from the jobs when steve was asked what does he actually do musicians play their instruments i play the orchestra
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,i personally though the iphone was bad but this couldnt be any worse
technology,not_removed,i absolutely agree i dont understand this at all i thought the trend was towards hdmi as a standard is there anything even replacing it or are they just banking on everyone having an apple tv for the bluetooth
technology,not_removed,just use an adapter s
technology,not_removed,apple seems to want to push its auxiliary products onto customers now more than ever removing the hdmi port forces them to buy an apple tv if they want to stream their screen to a tv
technology,not_removed,it called steve jobs diedall these stupid ideas have been around forever steve jobs told them to go fuck off then he died and now they do all this dumb shit he vetoed
technology,not_removed,i mean what was it designed for oh i can tell you exactly what its for the walled garden lightning connectors use a proprietary chip that authenticates the cable making it harder to make knockoffs of since apple owns the connector if they force the connector onto all their devices it eventually gets to where its really expensive to leave the garden since none of your accessories will work
technology,not_removed,this is the answer been telling everyone ivy is destroying the brand he wants to make everything about appearance which isnt the same as design great design includes making the experience seamless and functional he wants to make the appearance seamless not the same both sides had to look identical for ivy so he put usbc on both ends i would bet my left nut he wanted to drop the aux port as well to make it perfect the fact that they got rid of the mag safe port alone is absolutely insane it was one of apples best innovations then to remove your own peripheral lightning port jesus theyve gone mad im a power user and there is no way im buying whats really a macbook air this would be the first time in years that ill consider owning something other than a mac if this is the future of mac i need to start packing my bags im terrified to see the new imac i really have no idea what theyll remove for no good reason but its going to hurt productivity
technology,not_removed,thats the point of the article apple has essentially taken the air and the pro and smashed them together creating a product no one really wanted in the first place
technology,not_removed,i bought an air about a month ago i was worried that id regret getting one with an apple event so soon on the horizon but i dont regret anything anymore
technology,not_removed,just the sheer balls to call anything pro you cant even expand with more memory or storage or easily replace the battery on so you can keep proing when it runs dry not only that but they call the pro that one that has dual core and no dedicated graphics card what professional thing are you supposed to do with dual core and no graphics card edit spreadsheets in excel
technology,not_removed,there is a tiny subset of djs that use only their keyboard but they are aware that they are completely insane for doing so even so they arent using algoriddm algoriddm made their name selling dj software on tablets the only person ive seen using a tablet in a pro environment was one guy in using an ancient archos tablet with linux on there i do think tablet software for djing will come of age and be a serious contender one day but it isnt there yet it needs to interface with controllers better for a start and support cdj hid mode
technology,not_removed,this is a nextgeneration macbook air nah the macbook air is actually a good product and does what it is suppose to do to perfection
technology,not_removed,the touch bar is zlatan
technology,not_removed,hurts reading that as a manchester united fan
technology,not_removed,as a fan of both that hit too close to home ouch
technology,not_removed,the quote about buying a pc was about the ipad pro but i can still name a dozen and a half reasons to buy a pc even if you own an ipad pro all of which focus on a variation of the question what if i want to do something
technology,not_removed,the other day i walked into best buy and tried headphones there a pair of beats sounded obviously worse than sonys or sennheisers or ues i dont know if they used kbps files for beats or the beats were just bad the only reason apple purchased beats was for the name and the market share ironically beats after apple purchase seems to be losing market share pretty quickly i dont see half as many people wearing beats on the streets as i did years ago
technology,not_removed,for the love of god dont get a windows phone
technology,not_removed,electric computers one can dream of the future
technology,not_removed,in my opinion that core demographic you described is the iphones the macbook pros core demographic is still the content and entertainment creators because theyve been using the os for so long yes a large number of people will buy a mbpro because they like to show the apple off while drinking their pumpkin spice coffee at whatever starbucks but theres an even larger amount of people who are going to buy it because creating on the same os theyve been using forever is important i might be wrong though im really curious to see how the sales go
technology,not_removed,may you please add an sd card slot and hdmi port so that the common peasant can still use the laptop connected to a decent monitor and transfer data with ease
technology,not_removed,what would lightning give you on a laptop to use your shitty new headphones and magsafe with data congrats you just created yet another port keep magsafe make it just for power but allow the other c ports to also charge my ideal would be magsafe usbc usba and an sd reader everything else im mostly fine with except the crazy price
technology,not_removed,great post and good suggestions all around
technology,not_removed,my girlfriend insists on needing the macbook because its easy to use she checks email and browses pintrest thats literally it
technology,not_removed,i know antiapple circlejerk is quite strong in here but mbp is actually very dominant among software developers who need powerful machines but this new mbp is a joke though theres nothing pro about it
technology,not_removed,how will they write their novel in the corner of a warmly lit starbucks without peak performance
technology,not_removed,usually when people say because its better they really mean it and there are plenty of reasons besides professional use many prefer osx over windows the hardware is adequately fast for everyday tasks and things like entry level video and photo editing build quality is great and the design is aesthetically pleasing inputs are fantastic support is excellent integration with iphoneipad viruses are difficult to get etc and until this release the retina macbook pro was competitively priced these are all legitimate reasons for regular people i dont get why people have a problem with others enjoying their mac
technology,not_removed,i love my xps and run ubuntu on it i needed an upgrade last december but didnt want to buy old apple hardware so decided to give it a shot previously was on macs for about years im super happy with it and the new macbook pros are basically running the same hardware ive been running for a year now
technology,not_removed,apple is only at the top because pcs arent a single brand macs are still in the overwhelming minority of computers
technology,not_removed,but did they have to make the slope so steep
technology,not_removed,its just a shame i grew up when apple was good then terrible and then absolutely amazing and it became amazing when steve got the company back after the first few product releases under cook i realized that the magic is gone it just sucks but its like any creative streakit only lasts so long
technology,not_removed,you mean ipod classic
technology,not_removed,well the iphone the ipod the old school macbook pros when jobs was still around the old school mac pros were all good apples design with the macbook pros back in the day caused a lot of windows laptop makers to step up their game so we have apple to thank for that
technology,not_removed,donglebook by far theyre certainly not bad products but are definitely not innovative and very expensive
technology,not_removed,im still using a mbp and its only recently started showing its age i was planning on replacing it soon but not with the nonsense they just released dont know what im gonna do if my current one dies
technology,not_removed,apple customers are those that need a good share of power in an approachable and easy to use package they should hire you
technology,not_removed,not anymore they removed the glowing apple logo
technology,not_removed,i think the of ram is a limitation from the cpu theyre using as many other laptops are also maxed out at that said they could have kept the laptop thicker used more powerfulpower hungry parts and had a bigger battery to compensate but apple loves thinness usb c ports is looking towards the future but i think it would have been better to have usb c and a handful of legacy ports
technology,not_removed,i own a macbook air bought used but yes i found majority of macbook owners to be wannabe elitist snobs
technology,not_removed,none of those manufacturers give you the convenience of having a store that you can just go to to have your laptop fixed most of the time the support is going to be located in a call center in a third world country i purchased a dell from the business outlet that came with a year nextbusinessday onsite warranty it was definitely nice having someone come to you but these are third party contractors that may or may not be fully trained on your particular machine
technology,not_removed,kinda like beats by dre
technology,not_removed,i had to rewatch it many many times
technology,not_removed,apple donglebook pro
technology,not_removed,apple theres an app for that tm apple theres an adapter for that
technology,not_removed,ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ raise your donglesヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ
technology,not_removed,ditch that dusty old red weapon and shoot with your iphone
technology,not_removed,i dont think this should be sarcasm they really are trying to lock you into their ecosystem
technology,not_removed,and the iphones cant even connect to the new macbook pros without buying an adapteradditional cable
technology,not_removed,icloud is ridiculous the windows sync client flat out does not work and the only way to bulk download photos is with an inane automatic mass file download api that nukes chrome meanwhile i can download a zip of my google photos library easily
technology,not_removed,oh you want to take pictures in remote areas that dont have cell service just another for the ireach satellite upload attachment for the optional ireach tripod stand and just a month to subscribe to the ireach satellite upload service which uploads your images asyoushoot note unable to upload images already stored on the icamera stored images may be lost if not already syncd to your icloud storage
technology,not_removed,yeah but card readers are usually usb not usbc so you need a dungle for your dungle dunglelidoo
technology,not_removed,thats why windows switches between shitty and sane so that the sane seems sane in comparison
technology,not_removed,dont forget me
technology,not_removed,well tim id buy one because it is more functional and a better value
technology,not_removed,mapping my caps lock to escape was the best thing ive ever done for my vim workflow id highly recommend it
technology,not_removed,so just like apple they thought the pros would be the ones that dont want function keys are these companies totally out of touch with reality put that garbage on a chromebook or something cheap that attracts grandparents the term power user or pro implies that you want more keys more ports and more control over your device
technology,not_removed,its really sad when the old laptops sound like a huge upgrade on paper to the new laptops
technology,not_removed,the funny thing is out of the box you need a dongle to attach their iphone to the mac but you can connect their rivals pixel without one
technology,not_removed,they could have solved this problem easily by ditching the lightning in favor of usbc on the new iphone and then shipping both usbc and usba cables in the box like the google pixel does that would be a huge boost to the usbc transition we would have a truly universal standard because now all the new android phones are moving this way too plus just as an ecosystem bonus now the usbc headphones would plug right into the new macbook pro as well this kind of an integration between products requires a strong leader at the top with an unwavering vision thats what jobs provided in his absence the company is fragmented teams arent talking to each other theyre not pursuing a cohesive ecosystem design theyre starting to fork
technology,not_removed,yeah but think of all those extra sales theyd be giving up on peripherals
technology,not_removed,what good is the new mac in cafes without the glowing apple
technology,not_removed,came here to post edit apparently the same article at a different site at least enjoy the tldr similarrehash article from venturebeat tldr creativevision ceos frequently surround themselves with executives who are good at executing on a plan but because they are so close to each other the visionary didnt see that the executors dont have the same long term creative pivots this causes companies with habits of disruption and design to be swapped into a nice of shortterm gains and minor changes losing their habits for vision
technology,not_removed,this is what happens when sales and marketing people run the company as opposed to product people jobs himself explained it best
technology,not_removed,the rot set in before jobs even got cancer they killed the xserve basically killed os x server killed aperture crippled final cut i think the success of the iphone is really what changed things the computer side started to become less important the mass market became more important the need to find niches in creative industry and with prosumers became unimportant they just stopped caring about this segment if you compare something like the powermac in terms of its relative power and expandability to the current mac pro its a joke
technology,not_removed,yep and tesla took all their engineers
technology,not_removed,classic design by committee problems they really need a strong leader to be a unifying voice to tell people that ideas are stupid from time to time
technology,not_removed,too many cooks spoil the broth
technology,not_removed,they dont care if people are upset over the decision when people are still buying thing in droves by this time next year everyone will have forgotten the entire omg no jack thing now why they didnt do usbc so their phone and computer are actually compatible is totally mind blowing but thats another issue
technology,not_removed,apple arent really historically known for innovating by making weird moves like that they dropped the internal modem and more recently ethernet from their laptops quite early merged individual line in audio out into one socket before many others dropped dvd optical drives and hard drives from laptops before many others gave up on the mechanical clicker in the touch pads included display port rather than hdmi for ages put out the macbook air with no hard drive or optical drive the recent macbook with no ports except usbc and a jack not to mention resisting a right mouse button for decades i think that often they made reductionsinnovations and got it right on my macbook pro i eventually replaced my internal dvd drive with an ssd there is a dust empire inside my ethernet port i rarely use the card reader display port or firewire but i never want to trade the ability to charge the laptop charge a phone and plug in headphones or a line out i agree that they have got this massively wrong maybe overconfident from a minimalist approach that has previously worked but now seems to be on a path to creating products with the functionality of a polished aluminium space grey buttplug
technology,not_removed,a few cycles ago mac adding back hdmi to the macbook was huge you didnt have to carry an adapter an adapter that took up space and could be forgotten or lost many people dont care but those who do those who are in sales etc care a lot same with charging if you travel your laptop is often your charger for your phone and tablet you can save space in your luggage by not carrying dedicated chargers and in hotel rooms where plugs are often scarce or poorly located you can easily have all devices charging now youve got to have extra adapters or special cables a usb c cable for your laptop and usb a for the rest of the world the chargers on planes etc to not even have a single a port was dumb kinda like not having a headphone jack edit this bit from the article sums it up perfectly why cant you plug the lightning headphones that come in the iphone box into the new mac why doesnt the iphone come with the right cable for the new macbook pro why doesnt apple make a screen that properly works with its own devices why did apple highlight how great the touch bar is for messaging but didnt even port most of the new imessage features to macos properly do i have to carry two pairs of headphones now how do i charge my lightning cable mouse why remove the hdmi port a standard thats still incredibly popular for plugging into tvs why remove the sd card a popular slot for creatives using cameras
technology,not_removed,how can you integrate an hdmi monitor through the cloud how do they expect photographers to transfer photos from sd cards this is just supid stupid stupid
technology,not_removed,its a valid point i see it as a bigger picture issue though the entire design aesthetic of apple is supposedly it just works look at all these pc and android chumps faffing about you pay a lot of money for a beautiful yet ultimately limited ecosystem knowing that the benefit is seamless integration i mean that incredibly annoying but successful marketing campaign im a mac distilled that for every single advert the current situation shows very clearly that they are not on point in terms of a unified system your brand new hardware doesnt work together easily you say some tech is dead but then use that tech you have itunes app store apple music etc none of which are particularly good or work wseamlessly some kind of apple tv that people dont seem to care about and a watch that doesnt appear to do much an ipad pro that is big but still cant run actual desktop apps so not pro in other words i love my macbook pro and my ipod classic but i am not going to outlay thousands of dollars just for your name obviously some people are but the latest mbp release has got me really waiting for the surface pro if the digitiserscreen is in the ballpark of the studio i am there
technology,not_removed,tell me how i can charge my iphone from new macbook pro i dont care about data
technology,not_removed,pretty sure they are talking more about build quality than specs
technology,not_removed,no apple had decent monitors marketed as gold and sold as platinum the bar has always been so much higher than the then current retina monitors nec eizo back then even fujitsusiemens toshiba all had their valiant alternatives and also the pro lines to put said apple monitors to shame apple was great at marketing a product that could fulfill the needs of the average joe by making him feel special with a product that was allegedly better because hell it fit his needs
technology,not_removed,i find the xerox case very interesting if they played their cards right they could have owned the entire computer market
technology,not_removed,yup which is why he was an idea guy not a marketing guy and it worked twice even both times he left the company went to crap i kinda feel thats part of why ms did so wellaside from the big blue headstart they didnt let the marketing guys run everything but the surface stuff does look cool
technology,not_removed,he was smart enough to know this would happen if only everyone else was
technology,not_removed,jobs would be fuming if his engineers told him you couldnt connect the new iphone to the new macbook right out the box like what the fuck apple at its core was always about simplicity now you need dongles to use your old headphones you literally cannot use the new iphone earpods on the new macbook and you have to buy a usbc to lightning cable to backup your phone on your macbook what simplicity
technology,not_removed,apple didnt make siri
technology,not_removed,fuckery isis fucking around in europe and turkey nobodys indicted from the panama papers failed coup in istanbul brexit cold war clinton v trump philippines hitler korean rasputin china feeling frisky rejection of colombian peace exploding cellphones apple edit
technology,not_removed,but on the other hand they kinda nailed it with the headphone jack on the macbook pro
technology,not_removed,usbc does display you just need thats right you guessed it an adapter
technology,not_removed,the usb c ports support video out but youd need a usb c to hdmi cable or adapter at least until tvs and monitors start supporting usb c
technology,not_removed,displayport is challenging hdmi and iirc technically better both of which that are compatible through the usbc ports not defending the macbook though i think its stupid also
technology,not_removed,i think ive just designs for himself hes rich as fuck and can afford to go out and buy all new usb c peripherals when the machine drops all other port options
technology,not_removed,then to remove your own peripheral lightning port you cannot use the same pair of headphones on the macbook pro and iphone thats just insane
technology,not_removed,its true macs used to have all the standards plus their own innovations which were often better now they have only their own take on things and each one is worse
technology,not_removed,wait like the regular macbook
technology,not_removed,i did the same thing with the macbook pro i was worried that once the next month rolled around and the new mbps were revealed that i would feel like a fool for not waiting i had my air for years and i plan on using this pro for just as long or more
technology,not_removed,the price will take away the words like crazy
technology,not_removed,i dont think it will laptop sales are down across the market and apples macbook pro computers have never been massive volume sellers the way the air iswas the inch versions since the retina display era began are especially only really in the realm of professional and company purchases if someone wants a mac the air and macbook are already more than enough for most peoples uses and cost hundreds less
technology,not_removed,there are a lot of excel pros though more than the artistic crowd apple usually caters to
technology,not_removed,beardyman uses buttloads of tablets and his own apps on them but hes bit of an exception i guess
technology,not_removed,microsoft really need to sort out the audio stack in windows a bit more as the surface would be perfect for it otherwise
technology,not_removed,more like was at this point
technology,not_removed,i think as has happened before theres a bit of a mismatched comparison going on there by and large i think the criticisms of these new apple products are fair and reasonable however to say that the air was perfect seems a bit like rose tinted glasses the model starts at and doesnt even have a full hd panel come on that screen should have been updated years ago this seems like the same thing that happened with the rmbp came out and creative professionals were still swearing blind that the non retina was the best buy because apparently a dvd drive you only use occasionally was more important than a much higher quality screen for people doing photo and video like i said i think the criticisms of the changes are fair this thing is expensive not that well targeted and just a bit confusing in many ways but i think people are doing the classic thing of ignoring existing models pretty obvious issues so they can go down the dont build em like they used to road in discussions in fact apple do build airs like they used to way too much like they used to which is the issue
technology,not_removed,nah zlatan is the lack of headphone jack pogba is the bar
technology,not_removed,didnt they mentioned that an ipad pro was the perfect replacement of a high end pc workstation im not a pc elitist and i give credit to other options when its due but some of their statements are highly exaggerated
technology,not_removed,beats are a fashion brand not many casual people care about a tiny difference in audio quality as long as the bass sounds decent and they look cool wearing them
technology,not_removed,knowing elon musk hed decide to make gas powered computers to spite the status quo fuckthefreeworld
technology,not_removed,i cant really speak for myself but one of my friends is a dj hes had a powerbook and two macbooks in the last years whatever hes disgusted by the new line and doesnt even know if hell stick with apple anymore
technology,not_removed,while youre at it give it a tablet form factor with detachablereversible keyboard add an hd touchscreen and detachable pen and a microsoft logo and lower the price by now youre on to something
technology,not_removed,maybe do some market research for if display port is pervasive enough to replace hdmi if it does then a display port hdmi adapter should be included
technology,not_removed,while this pizza is aggressive those are decent suggestions
technology,not_removed,you almost literally described a razor blade laptop httpwwwrazerzonecomgamingsystemsrazerblade
technology,not_removed,yup exactly the kind of user im talking about people that would be perfectly fine with even something like a chromebook
technology,not_removed,i get it though i much prefer os x to windows but without an option closer to im just not sure im gonna be able to buy another macbook since like your girlfriend i am not a content creator unless that machine lasts for years without any degradation in performance i might just end up with a windows machine if my macbook goes out this year
technology,not_removed,yep took apple years to get a total global user base of less than million macs there are billion nonapple pcs in global use thats vs pcs sell million units per quarter apple sells million macs per quarter yet every year apple enjoys fudging the numbers and flat out lying about their market share like this stat apparently showing apple is much better at user adoption upgrading their macs to new os versions compared to windows i wonder how quick and easy it is to have a few of millions of users upgrade their computers compared to of millions apple even likes to give people halfnumbers thats numbers without comparison so theyre meaningless macs have now gained global market share for of the last quarters luca maestri apple cfo talking about double digit growth despite the facts yeah no shit it could be just a few points that would count as growth but without knowing how much your competition grew its meaningless to compare a company to its own history heres how much the nonapple pc market sold each quarter over the last few years percentages here and there as growth dont mean much unless they are significantly going to move the needle of total numbers sold in this case apple doesnt make a dent in global pc sales or global active users sources yeah no shit percentages rise fast when you only have a few million macs around the world try updating over a billion nonapple pcs percentage may be lower but more pcs are being updated its all about perspective and apple is very fond of only giving the stats sometimes even half the equation that makes them look golden look how they annually like to boast how many macs they sell and how much moar they sell than pcs httpiimgurcomzjwffiyjpg httpiimgurcommgdfbipjpg well hot shit would ya look at how fast and awesome those sales are pcs must be doing no sales at all sources httpwwwzdnetcomarticlewhatosxyosemitesaysaboutthefutureofthepc
technology,not_removed,this i dont think people really understand this
technology,not_removed,they do seem to have a degree of hubris at the moment i think the top spot is there for the taking by another company
technology,not_removed,the only really good product apple made for years now dead
technology,not_removed,get a surface book
technology,not_removed,as many other laptops are also maxed out at but not the direct competitors to the macbook pro that is imo what apple dont seem to understand its been for a long time it should be now especially for the price theyre putting these things out at personally im fine with the usbc ports thats a good decision i think maybe they couldve still kept a couple of other things like an sd card reader and hdmi but oh well
technology,not_removed,even used i think theyre too expensive
technology,not_removed,now with dongledongles

technology,not_removed,raise your dongles
technology,not_removed,apple time to adapt
technology,not_removed,worth of apple cables later
technology,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgalleryhigjs
technology,not_removed,we realized that adapters are much more expensive than apps so were going that route
technology,not_removed,fix there are as series of adapters for that
technology,not_removed,dongles out for jobs
technology,not_removed,praise helix
technology,not_removed,with a whole gb of icloud storage
technology,not_removed,motherfucking hilarious at this point
technology,not_removed,youd be better off with a usbc hub that has a bunch of usb ports until they do make card readers mice etc in usbc
technology,not_removed,thats actually the running theory they drop something like vista as a sort of testing ground then clean it up with drop with their live tiles and all that bullshit then clean it up with
technology,not_removed,how could i forget you s
technology,not_removed,and xp right after it dammit theyre good
technology,not_removed,and it kind of sucks for us who want a mac for real work
technology,not_removed,yeah they literally were the go to for designers lets be fair now theyre suckered into their own narcissistic selling point and delivering products that are a sheer advertisement and what i believe soon to be not the go to machine for the professional user
technology,not_removed,except apple clearly doesnt when all the pros get pushed out of apple the amateurs will follow because theyre trying to be like the pros in those fields but that will take a while
technology,not_removed,the amateur market will vanish as soon as the pro market vanishes though fender doesnt sell tons of squier guitars because any more serious guitarist keeps the fuck away from fender on the contrary only because fender is known to be a proper guitar maker squier sells so much source am a shit guitarist own a squier strat
technology,not_removed,i thought this was apples core demographic in the first place i doubt the real creatives exist in sufficient numbers to market to them
technology,not_removed,their targeting creative people with their ads too as if they expected something like this would happen they jumped early and will only continue to push those demographics
technology,not_removed,yeah but likebesides that s
technology,not_removed,but why really tho why would you buy it really
technology,not_removed,whenever i see a keyboard that has sacrificed the arrow keys to the dark lord i clench my teeth boy oh boy just wait til you see mechanical keyboards
technology,not_removed,whats even more hilarious is that google now has android phones that were designed and guided by google itself that work seamlessly with both lastcurrent gen macboks pcs and the new macbooks right out of the box nexus nexus pixel and pixel xl since theyre all usbc and come with usba to c cables in the box apple currently offers none when your competitors products work flawlessly out of the box and massively faster due to them actually using the usb spec unlike iphone usb lightning connector with your newest product without them planning to yet yours require a slew of dongles sometime seriously didnt think things through
technology,not_removed,the pixel also comes with a usbc to usba dongle you can plug that into a different port on the macbook and then use your old usb accessories with it hell you could even use the dongle to connect your iphone to your macbook
technology,not_removed,but then you could plug the new earbuds into an android device and we cant have that now can we
technology,not_removed,apple actively opposes universal standards they want you to buy a whole slew of cables and accessories instead
technology,not_removed,yeah but that would mean you would be able to use iphone gear with other phones how would they stand out when the stuff made for their phones can be used with other phones
technology,not_removed,theyre saving that to boost sales of the iphone apple is good at giving features by slow drip then theyre going to call it revolutionary
technology,not_removed,theyd have to sell extra dongles to make up for one lost mac sale so that doesnt really make sense just sayin
technology,not_removed,microsoft user here how does it feel
technology,not_removed,to be honest it really bothered me when i learned they took that away
technology,not_removed,im just glad i have my mac thats over ten years old and barely running but god damn i aint giving apple anymore money i almost bought the iphone too no thanks apple go fuck yourselves
technology,not_removed,but thats all ancient history it doesnt really matter anymore oh the irony
technology,not_removed,wow its prophetic almost
technology,not_removed,wow the sad sad irony
technology,not_removed,it blows my mind how perfect of a vision this guy had thanks for sharing that video
technology,not_removed,killing aperture and killing studio was the writing on the wall any clearheaded creative should have needed to see when it came to apples future loyalty to pros unfortunately most creatives i know stuck their head in the sand and spent untold thousands in workarounds for years to come
technology,not_removed,those massive mac pros were the balls so beautifully engineered
technology,not_removed,the end of aperture and its replacement with the photos software turd was the nail in the coffin for me i was hopeful that theyd one day produce a proper mac pro again after the current one goes the way of the cube but nope they just dont give a shit about professional computers any more i have drive bays in my mac pro occupied and every port they dont sell anything now that would replace my desktop all garbage i doubt my next computer will be a mac unless they turn around again in the next years
technology,not_removed,you could open it for a start
technology,not_removed,the thing is steve jobs was really good at marketing stuff because he believed in his products like they were the holy grail he had the passion and the charisma to reflect pure love for his products to the masses steve jobs and therefore apple got sympathy and hype in die early years because the company was different than the bad wolf microsoft they were different because their products had love for detail the products felt like hand made for the consumer which also made the consumer different from the masses and special later apple lost that appeal they became the big dog they tried too hard to be different when in fact they werent that special anymore then steve jobs and apple got sympathy again because jobs no longer only advertised the product as different and special but marketed the person steve jobs itself jobs became the product and it worked even if it shouldnt have nowadays even that appeal went away with jobs going away now apple seems like the sun fading away which again makes real fans cling to their products no matter what but on the same hand also makes the notsobig fans run away because they dont see what they used to see in apple jobs still got more praise than he actually deserved and thats probably the reason why so many sad consumers now blame apple for wasting away without jobs as the bright sun and the head of the spear today apple seem to be still chasing the being different appeal when in reality most of the things they do differently and advertise as the apple eco system is just adding and removing stuff to further decrease compability with other nonapple products for the real fans that actually still looks innovative and different for nonfans it just looks like a sad and silly moneygrab just my thoughts on the matter
technology,not_removed,the previous generation macbook pro was great haptic feedback on the touchpad a great display a sensible set of ports killing their server business made sense it wasnt the right market for apple and they werent succeeding but this one just feels like they werent trying their iphone division wasnt talking to their macbook division and neither of them were doing the market research which shouldve predicted the obviously negative reaction that theyre seeing now
technology,not_removed,yeah it basically turned them more into a fashion or tech accessories brand they still dominate most creative industries but its mostly because they are already prevalent and people prefer the interface once theyre accustomed to it youve been able to do basically whatever you can do on a mac on a pc for a long time now and every little screw up that leads to one more creative switching to pc for the price and practicality and these customers are going to have to be won back
technology,not_removed,we always jokingly call apple the tesla graveyard if you dont make it at tesla you go work at apple only that in reality they left because tesla gave them shitty work conditions and shitty pay
technology,not_removed,theyve stopped caring about making money through excellence and have just gone after brand and mass market
technology,not_removed,the problem is that there are investors who aggressively seek out successful companies that have recently lost their strong leadership they harass the new weak leaders including sometimes manipulating stock price into losses into bad decisions they take all the decades of putting longterm company value above profit and leverage that into a couple of good quarters of great shortterm stock growth options they gut the company basically apple is going to take a few years to come out of it they have a really good market position though iphone will remain popular osx is the most popular consumer alternative to windows and comes with the power of unix and theyve branded really well so they shouldnt crash and burn fully
technology,not_removed,speaking of bad design by committee decisions take a look at the new meetupcom rebranding i dont think a shittier logo icon could be designed even if you had an ai do it
technology,not_removed,its my duty as internet citizen to leave here
technology,not_removed,they dont care if people are upset over the decision when people are still buying thing in droves i have my doubts about that there really isnt a precedent for a move like that in apples hardware for instance this isnt exactly like when they removed the optical drive from the mbp lineup at the time that was actually becoming more and more of a niche and anyone who really needs it can still just go get an external cd readerwriter hell apple still makes one thats really the last time a major peripheral was removed from one of their devices where i remember hearing such an outcry but even back then it was understandable the headphone jack is just not on its way out though no matter how you slice it its going to be around for a long time to come it wont matter if every newlymanufactured bluetooth audio device is suddenly capable of playing a perfectly lossless audio stream with no connectivity issues and affordable audiophilegrade bluetooth headphones suddenly flood the market some people will always want or need the trs connection its a foolproof connector that is a standard on nearly every piece of audio equipment thats been made for decades now i know apple has historically been unwilling to undo any of their controversial changes but i really think this is new territory for them bringing it back in a new model will be a selling point now just think of all the pr theyll get from the huge and one more thing were sorry slide at some iphone event in the future
technology,not_removed,why they didnt do usbc because then they wont make another few million selling cables
technology,not_removed,they got rid of the sd card
technology,not_removed,upvote so much an even more simple scenario coworker sends me pdf files as mail attachments i want to make an entirely new mail with both these files attached can i do that in ios no because there is no filesystem to save them to and to pick attachments from ridiculous how devices with such a basic limitation ever get approved for business situations
technology,not_removed,basically apple made a laptop that is less mobile friendly than pc manufacturers the whole point about laptops is mobility it should just be laptop and power supply and not laptop and possibly different adapters to get it to function properly
technology,not_removed,they dont but the cloud is also unfriendly to users who need to do much less i was in an apple store the other day looking at macbooks with my wife who just needs to do excelinternet apple guy went on and on about the cloud is the future usb keys are the past multiple ports are the past a wife works in finance sending confidential consumer data through the cloud is a big nono b the cloud is spotty at best even when internet access is good ive had word documents sit in onedrives upload que for minutes even though im wired to a gigabit connection in the end we bought a thinkpad much to the consternation of the apple guy
technology,not_removed,they could have been ibm they could have been the microsoft of the
technology,not_removed,the new iphone should have switched to usbc and kept the headphone jack would have been amazing to see every major android phone and iphone use the same cables
technology,not_removed,this is the real head scratcher for me ive never really minded the whole closed ecosystem deal ive just never bought into it but why on earth would you make it so your two newest devices cant connect to each other out of the box seems like a pretty glaring oversight or it indicates a complete lack of the different design departments effectively communicating with each other
technology,not_removed,oh they bought it regardless jobs was much more careful what he put the company name on he with wozniak built the company from scratch and would never let one of his products be less than his vision of perfect
technology,not_removed,also leicester fucking city
technology,not_removed,at least progressive metal is having a badass year of releases
technology,not_removed,dont forget an increase in tension between russia and the west plus china is claming ownership of a rather large part of water
technology,not_removed,korean rasputin
technology,not_removed,dont forget colombia rejected a peace deal after nearly years of civil war what the fuck indeed
technology,not_removed,whats the philippine hitler thing
technology,not_removed,ive been thinking about this song a lot this year
technology,not_removed,really bold move imo i expect other manufacturers to start adding headphone jacks to their laptops soon apple has always lead the way in innovation and this idea of private music is very useful and something i can see other companies using long live apple and long live this headphone jack malarky
technology,not_removed,pretty courageous
technology,not_removed,or usbc hdmi cable
technology,not_removed,technically they are thunderbolt which means they will eventually become a display standard most monitors and tvs these days have a display port just like they have hdmi and in the next five years youll see that become a thunderbolt port the usbc thing isnt the problem its the lack of unity if every apple product went usbc this year it would make sense usbc driven display usbc iphone usbc laptop usbc headphones and a free adapter in every box would turn this pr nightmare into a massive resounding success and despite the underpowered laptop people would be saying well apple is trying to drag us into the future rather than clearly they have no idea what they are doing
technology,not_removed,usb c to hdmi cable or adapter another to add to the price of your laptop plus one more hideous adapter
technology,not_removed,im ok with having an adapter for that with my surface but thats because its a tablet i still think its stupid that the macbook pro needs the same adapter why would i ever want to have less functionality on a laptop
technology,not_removed,on hdmi is a crapshoot on displayport mostly works fine as long as you dont use overly cheap cables or a passive kvm
technology,not_removed,displayport and hdmi were designed for different things and will continue to coexist displayport is to link computers to monitors hdmi is to link consumer electronics equipment for example displayport doesnt support cec consumer electronic commands nor arc audio return channel both of which are very useful in a home theater setup but not at all useful in a computer setup which is why hdmi has them and displayport doesnt
technology,not_removed,yeah but you would know
technology,not_removed,yes but now that regular macbook has the battery of the air with the price of the pro and usability of a macbook that had a drill shoved in its ports
technology,not_removed,i miss my black macbook i hope i can get it fixed
technology,not_removed,excel pros easily need more than a dualcore im not one but i know that excel can get pretty cpuheavy
technology,not_removed,unfortunately for apple you can run excel on pretty much every device in existence not made by apple
technology,not_removed,but beardyman is not a dj he is more like a guy who creates loops on the fly using various methods but mostly beatboxing his previous rig used to consist mostly of many korg kaoss pads beardyman is fing awesome
technology,not_removed,nah the treatment of schweinsteiger is the lack of headphone jack
technology,not_removed,audio quality is also a thing that i feel you kind of have to train at least a little bit to recognize most people seem to go their whole lives listening to radioquality or worse music in their cars with windows down or at home through tv speakers sound bars or via stock earbuds of phones unless they get like a long intimate time with fancy audio gear they arent going to appreciate it right away because audio quality simply isnt something theyve ever even really thought about what is obvious to an audionerd is sometimes quite subtle to a layperson
technology,not_removed,this happened to me for vfx creative work i was a fanatical mac user since the mid but switched to pc a few years ago when i needed better hardware when the mac pro was aging windows is close enough to mac os in functionality and when you spend of your time in chrome and adobe cc it doesnt even matter much anymore
technology,not_removed,displayport is nowhere near pervasive enough most people traveling with laptops hooking them up to a screen are doing so on a television or projector system—not a desktop monitor its still incredibly rare to see televisions with displayport inputs as opposed to hdmi
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,while i dont like the logo either i think the blade actually looks pretty slick
technology,not_removed,google admin here chromebooks can meet the needs of of people they just dont know they exist
technology,not_removed,or yah know a cell phone
technology,not_removed,there is a difference between what someone needs to get by and what is a preferable experience most of the chromebooks ive seen have shit displays and keyboards
technology,not_removed,you can call me one of the apple haters i dont care the ipod classic was a fucking gem the best and only thing i think apple developped which was by far superior to anything anyone has ever done in the music player business i also have to admit that the original iphone was revolutionary but it has been outdone severly by now always had my beef with apple but the ipod classic will stay with me
technology,not_removed,nope dongles sold separately
technology,not_removed,raise your heimerdongles
technology,not_removed,apple like we fucking give a damn
technology,not_removed,time to dongle™
technology,not_removed,they changed the ports again in the middle of the product announcement
technology,not_removed,adapters have much more margin than apps
technology,not_removed,youll never use an sd card again
technology,not_removed,they are devolving into a shit show and calling it courageous
technology,not_removed,im still waiting for them to clean up
technology,not_removed,with mes memory leaks easily what were we doing again
technology,not_removed,xp was a shit show after release but better than what we had i think people have a lot of selective memory on that one a couple service packs and it was ok
technology,not_removed,im not baiting im legitimately asking this as someone whos never owned anything apple other than an ipad if you put an equivalent windows pc next to a powerhouse of a mac and both were running the same version of photoshop why would the mac be superior
technology,not_removed,buy an xps or a surface pro
technology,not_removed,surface is pretty good
technology,not_removed,besides maybe graphic designers that have been conditioned to use macs most industries dont rely on a mac for real work the real consumer has always been the amateur they are just finally not trying to hide it
technology,not_removed,its growing but changing apple fans is really hard especially with the ecosystem that apple setup for them
technology,not_removed,hey hey dont you talk bad about my baby but seriously i need to hit fnother keys for arrow keys
technology,not_removed,i will never understand why anyone would want a i have to have a full keyboard with a number pad even on my laptop i use it too much to give it up i had a tiny netbook with a i think may be misremembering and i hated it i might have been able to live without the numpad but no arrow keys and no f keys is too far for me
technology,not_removed,boy oh boy just wait til you see mechanical keyboards actually a very popular variant of adds back in the arrow keys the however keyboards are also crazy popular by popular i mostly mean on the front page on rmechanicalkeyboards
technology,not_removed,a slew of dongles this is so much fun to say
technology,not_removed,nitpicking but doesnt ship with a usba to c cable
technology,not_removed,i switched to pixel from iphone because apple just wasnt doing it anymore out of the box my pixel was able to connect to my iphone through the usbc to usba dongle and transfer all of the data so my google phone can sync to an iphone better than the current macbook pro can
technology,not_removed,that and they would lose out on the proprietary adapter royalties
technology,not_removed,heaven forfend
technology,not_removed,drm locked headphones
technology,not_removed,which is why theyve got rid of the excellent proprietary magsafe port in favour of usbc charging on the mac
technology,not_removed,apple contributed quite a lot to the usb c standard which makes it even stranger
technology,not_removed,thats the funny thing their apple earbuds were such a fashion item ive seen plenty of people using them with non apple devices in the past but not any more
technology,not_removed,from a revenue standpoint sure from a margin standpoint not even remotely close
technology,not_removed,the light is gone
technology,not_removed,dude wtf now it seems like theyre trying to sabotage themselves that thing was the single greatest marketing campaign in tech history
technology,not_removed,the entire interview is on netflix goes about an hour
technology,not_removed,billions from ipods if only they hadnt also killed this off for the most part too
technology,not_removed,this is what i keep trying to get people at rapple to see im on the mac partly because in the midaughts i watched a lot of pros move there pros in many different fields that got me looking when i realized that i could basically have all the benefits of linux but none of the hassle i was sold i could even boot windows and put standard parts in the thing ifwhen it broke very unlike the mac i had abandoned in the i teach in a university information studies department almost all our professors used macs up until recently but im starting to see fewer apple logos in meetings our dean is using a surface book and is a fan but then again he was a beta tester and helped develop it a bit i just ordered a windows desktop and xps as a result of last weeks keynote all i wanted was another mac ultrabook with a new processor and a highresolution screen but they took away usb ports magsafe and maybe even your function keys if you want the higherend version and the prices are hundreds of dollars more than the competition even competition with full touchscreens when i walk into my classes with a dell my students are going to notice when all their profs start doing that theyre really going to notice and it wont be long before the students are all on windows again too apple does not seem to understand that although the money is in the masses you only get the masses if you get the pros
technology,not_removed,as ive been saying elsewhere recently im still very reliant on os x for music production thankfully i dont need any of apples software to get it done as long as the stability of the os and the audio and midi system isnt in jeopardy ill be fine i just feel really sad for those folks who got comfortable with aperture final cut pro or logic pro in the beginning every year it seems like im hearing more people complaining about features disappearing or getting nerfd
technology,not_removed,the main chassis was very well made the liquid cooling system on the other hand leaked like a fucking sieve
technology,not_removed,i wanted one at least just for the case and i was a pc guy still am and if i knew the first thing about modding id still want one
technology,not_removed,you may want to look at phantex cases they are pretty sweet and the cost isnt what you might expect mine ran me about usd i did a micro atx build and it is by far the cleanest build ive ever done not because im that good or anything the case just makes it easy other than the price increase that a micro atx build may bring fewer motherboards to choose from with that case ive got a corsair cleans easy looks good and the cable management is the best ive experienced by far almost everything in the case can be taken apart so if youre having trouble fitting your full size gpu in you can remove a plate and make it easy all the cables feed behind a plate and the designers put holes with rubber padding close to where the cables need to come out end result is that your cable management looks great even if you suck at it like i do downsides are that it is bigger than a micro atx case would be normally the racks that you can use to mount extra fans for water cooling and stuff are on the front and top the ones on the front didnt fit my so i had to move it to the top this interfered with my cd drive placement because they kinda threw it on the back because of this i had to take my cd drive out of the build i thought it was kinda silly but i havent used my cd drive in ages which is a good thing because the psu sits on the bottom and faces towards another compartment so you hook the cables you need to the power supply otherwise youll have to take it out to get it in there the build took me the better part of a night to finish assembling but once i did it looked clean felt slick and it purred would recommend edit its a bit dustier than id like but i havent detailed it in a few months
technology,not_removed,the tower was the one computer that briefly made me consider converting however at the time i couldnt afford it and these days i cant justify it with the hardware that apple pushes
technology,not_removed,same here im not a professional photographer just one of the legions of amateurs but i loved aperture now apples shown they dont give a damn about my needs so now ive got a choice of sticking with the sinking ship known as osx switching to privacydestroying windows or going with linux and the much more limited photo editing software options there im currently trying out ubuntu on my mac mini and trying darktable and krita for organizing and editing the os runs fast and stable on this hardware and darktable and krita seem capable programs but im not quite sold on it yet
technology,not_removed,it just stinks that even now they still dont technically allow or support virtualizing os xmacos on nonapple hardware if they were going to let server wither and die they could have at least rejiggered the os licensing agreement so that businesses could legally virtualize it especially now that the latest mac pro is this weird cylindrical thing that is all but completely unrackable why not just let the enterprise users virtualize it on datacenter hardware and be done with it stuff like that combined with this new mbp refresh is proof that they dont realize how many people rely on os xmacos theyve been so preoccupied with ios for so long that sometimes i really think theyve forgotten their workstation os exists
technology,not_removed,osx server was atrocious i remember setting up the dns server using the management console it didnt even save changes correctly i ended up installing vmware and linux
technology,not_removed,i think you twist or understate a critical factor of jobs importance he wasnt just great at marketing stuff he was also great at identifying what was really important i do happen to think that hed look at the new iphone and mbp and yell at his team calling them stupid for making the iphone not be able to be plugged not the mbp yeah he was kind of a boor sometimes but he caught onto lots of little and big stuff that matters
technology,not_removed,i suppose if you are a public company its inevitable at some point
technology,not_removed,i think the reason being a lack of leadership someone really does need to be able to say hey that idea sucks otherwise you end up with a bunch of nonsense source i took an industrial design class once in college as a gened and i think i got a b
technology,not_removed,power of unix this is only half true really they have consistently misimplemented or ignored posix standards for a good while they broke poll in most recently after having broken and fixed it in previous major versions
technology,not_removed,and the old logo and branding was so excellent and consistent with the hi my name is stickers which are so prevalent at meetups it is truly a shit logo now im actually waiting for some new features or considering an alternative to the platform it seems like you pretty much immediately go pro because of user count then have nothing cool to show for it
technology,not_removed,wow youre not wrong that looks seriously amateurish
technology,not_removed,yep now even if you have a usb card reader around its not likely to be usb c so youre gonna need a brand new card reader or yet another dongle i mean or you could just connect your camera directly to no wait you dont have a usb c cable for that either
technology,not_removed,wait ios doesnt give any filesystem access jesus
technology,not_removed,wow that is absolutely insane i know that apple doesnt consider the iphone or ipad as a productivity device but if a customer wants to do it why wouldnt apple let them oh right theyre apple the same company that says you only need one button on a mouse because they say so
technology,not_removed,yeah and its bullshit
technology,not_removed,wait what happened in leicester
technology,not_removed,any recommendations
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,hitler massacred three million jews now there is three million drug addicts id be happy to slaughter them at least if germany had hitler the philippines would have at which point he is reported to have pointed to himself
technology,not_removed,yeah people forget adapters are just for those current standards you still own usbc is the standard were moving towards so manymost future devices wont require adapters that said apples pushing this too aggressively even for my tastes
technology,not_removed,aka expensive adapter cable
technology,not_removed,the beauty of usb c is its an open standard searching amazon for hdmi to usb c nets hundreds of options for you dont have to buy the adapters from apple
technology,not_removed,because the point of apple pushing usbc only is that everyone else will hopefully follow line which is a good thing for everyone involved one port for everything thats been the io goal for forever and it is finally in reach but then they screw it up by not being brave enough to make their iphone usbc ugh
technology,not_removed,i find this alarmingly accurate
technology,not_removed,side rantyou should really start using a different program once youre doing stuff in excel that really bogs the system down
technology,not_removed,soooo pogba is the wireless headphones expensive as fuck full of potential but not doing shit for anyone right now
technology,not_removed,didnt chromebooks outsell mbps last year
technology,not_removed,comp sci student here loving my chromebook i have a real computer at home so why do i need fullfledged computer for the same price or more instead i just pay for something that gets the job done then install teamviewer and ubuntu for what i cant do on chrome os
technology,not_removed,im definitely one of the outliers here but running a linux distro on my acer for a mobile machine has been great for a couple years now it is a shame people dont realize they can spend a fraction of the money spent on a traditional laptop and get a similarbetter web experience with a chromebook
technology,not_removed,do they i mean an app has x in development but the cost per unit is near an adapter has a smaller development cost but higher cost per unit now they definitely win out on third party adapters where the cost of development is the cost of production is and they get something like per unit
technology,not_removed,ive been using since they allowed everyone to upgrade after turning off everything annoying like cortana its perfectly fine as of now it just runs like a cleaner with faster boot times not nearly as bad as vista or
technology,not_removed,its not so bad it has some annoying aspects but i strongly prefer it compared to
technology,not_removed,whats wrong with ive had zero issues with it
technology,not_removed,as a web developer the fact that macos is a unix environment is really nice every single server i deploy to is running some variation of linux being able to use the same commands same setup etc is very convenient can i do it all on my windows pc too sure can but its more convenient on my macbook
technology,not_removed,i dont know who has their physical build quality to the same level these days used to be id say lenovo thinkpads but well not anymore lol apple does have an advantage as well due to absolute control over the hardware they can squeeze power savings by making sure everything from the keyboard to the wifi cardchip behave well low power states rapid entry and exit from such etc there is also an advantage to only having to support a limited permutation of hardware this may even be tuned by apple on a permodel basis i have not checked one way or the other however if you spend grand on a mac and pc laptop the big features will be the same or better for the pc cpu ram gpu storage youll have a bit more trouble replicating a retina display but how much that matters to you i dont know
technology,not_removed,not sure about a pro for equivalent macbook work i have a surface book with a dgpu is better for more intensive work without losing the pen functionality and really great battery
technology,not_removed,i second the xps i own one its fantastic i also recommend it to all my clients those who do get it also love it
technology,not_removed,i understand your logic the can do absolutely everything a mac can do but some people just really prefer osx over windows even if its just for the feel and ui and not so much productivitys sakes and thats ok
technology,not_removed,xps is such a nice machine
technology,not_removed,i have an for uni and its absolutely fantastic thoroughly recommend it
technology,not_removed,now im no lover of the mac but once upon a time it was indeed the machine to use for getting serious work done in graphic design and digital publishing realms more recently even just a little over ten years ago the mac running final cut and the requisite additional hardware was really the only truly capable video editing platform for broadcast professionals without having to pay exorbitant amounts of money to avid then apple fucked us over by watering down final cut which adobe then fortunately picked up the slack for by improving premiere but the damage was done and video professionals including myself left the platform in droves but it was indeed once the platform to use i hated mac but i swore by it for my work through and through but as soon as i could use something else to do the job as effectively for less money thats what i moved to until that time the mac was the only answer edit words some are conditioned true but id hardly call my anecdote proof of that merely that these machines and software once were the most capable but no longer sadly
technology,not_removed,definitely not true a substantial proportion of developers use macs as their primary workstations for good or bad thats the state of the industry and im sad that theyre not catering to that demographic anymore
technology,not_removed,youre joking right ive been in the creative designvideo production and interactive app field for years and of people use macs i think you can call that real work heavy cg stuff is more pc but all of my developers and designers and video guys are on macs
technology,not_removed,im not sure if this is as true as it once was ive been seeing a lot of software engineering companies move to macs for development my hardwaresoftware company issues dells to managers salespeople and the like and macs to its engineers and designers one of my friends does circuit design for a microcontroller company and they all use macs as well windows isnt amazing for development especially with all the compatibility issues going between unixunixlike and dos environments i used windows throughout school and at my first internship but i find programming on a mac to be a smoother experience all around not sure why we dont use linux boxes but macs have been awesome and i came in to this job absolutely hating apple and everything it makes
technology,not_removed,i use to be a massive apple fan but im now trying to make the switch from apple to surface and it is incredibly difficult i still like using the ipad and iphone so having all the devices integrate nicely with my laptop was really nice but i really dislike how the companies treated professionals recently something they said during the announcement has really stood out to me recently they were demonstrating the autocad files showing how the surface is used to design the next generation of it and i cant see that being true for a lot of apples pro devices i think if microsoft came in now announcing a surface phone with an integrated ecosystem theyd make the transition a lot easier for a lot of potential apple users looking to make the switch
technology,not_removed,woo another they said i was crazy when i went overseas with both of my keyboards whos the crazy one now i guess me still
technology,not_removed,wait why hjkl and ctrlaenpfb works well for most things
technology,not_removed,most people dont type that many numbers and having a smaller keyboard gives you a slightly more ergonomic pose with reduced arm separation some actually choose to get a separate numpad on the left for number entry
technology,not_removed,thats just shameful
technology,not_removed,how is the pixel im on a the fence about getting it replacing my iphone
technology,not_removed,i really dont understand that move at all the magsafe charging port is one of the best features on the models it perfectly adapts to my laziness
technology,not_removed,no thats just some terrifying lunacy
technology,not_removed,it takes courage to be in darkness
technology,not_removed,it just hit me the company that built the legacy of mobile music cut the headphone jack on their products apple has lost all direction
technology,not_removed,apple does not seem to understand that although the money is in the masses you only get the masses if you get the pros and this shouldnt be so easy to miss sure pros might make up a small portion of the user base but were pretty darn persuasive as a teacher i moved dozens upon dozens of creatives to the mac as a freelancer ive consulted with hundreds of businesses and have always recommended the mac where it made sense in my own social circles im the computer guy and friends and family come to me for advice on purchases and lets not forget the two decades of macs ive purchased myself but im not going to do it anymore thats not out of some petty spite for releasing an overpriced underwhelming and long overdue update its because i honestly cant recommend purchasing a mac anymore half of the lineup is horribly overpriced and out of date and i just cant figure out who their new products are targeting its not anyone i know you can get much more on windows for far less that said i wont be jumping ship myself just yet its not easy to leave apple when youre this entrenched but i just offloaded a ton of stuff on ebay and ill slowly work towards being less reliant upon apples products for my business and personal use sad to say but after years in the fold im just no longer part of their target demographic
technology,not_removed,ive been a windows consumer my whole life but i seriously considered apple when i was upgrading my three year old laptop a few months ago but their offering was old expensive and sort of uncompetitive i ended up going with the xps cheaper than the mbp with significantly more performance i definitely had some serious issues with the first machine i got but i took it back to the microsoft store i bought it from on extended warranty and the replaced it no questions asked the second machine has been excellent i think once dell improves their production quality theyll be killing it because the xps line is cool as fuck its probably the closest windows ive seen to a mb in terms of quality of form
technology,not_removed,i have to say those surfaces look pretty cool im thinking of buying one
technology,not_removed,what software are you using that requires os x if its not logic
technology,not_removed,they hired fucking delphi automotive with no experience working with computers to build a watercooling system for the computer what did they expect
technology,not_removed,we have a couple at the shop were planning on making them into a httpmimgurcomlahejmwr
technology,not_removed,absolutely i still would want one i havent seen a similarly stylish and well built pc case but please link me if you know of one looking at making a gaming pc
technology,not_removed,the current mac pro i am not even sure what its purpose iswas i think it might be dead who bought one
technology,not_removed,oh they havent forgotten they just think of macs as the hardware authentication dongles you need to build ios apps
technology,not_removed,people dont seem to value poll very highly linux made httpsenwikipediaorgwikiepoll all the bsds and os x have httpsenwikipediaorgwikikqueue as an alternative netbsd never implemented
technology,not_removed,noooooope the first iphone i bought was a and boy have i been kicking myself ever since
technology,not_removed,they did a good football this year real good football
technology,not_removed,they won all the football even though their teams combined salary is less than some pro players causing a big upset in british football good for them i say
technology,not_removed,from personal taste and just from this year here are my current favorites in order thank you scientist stranger heads prevail haken affinity meshuggah the violent sleep of reason dream theater the astonishing not their best but a lot of work went into it and there are some solid songs if youre not familiar with them start with images and words or scenes from a memory one of the best prog metal albums period opeth sorceress dust of nations dust of nations plini handmade cities i think their older stuff is better but its still solid frost fallen satellites milliontown is a lot better imo but its older the dear hunter act v forgot about this one that i liked plenty thanks uthemadscientistwho there are other relevant ones but at that point i start liking individual songs more than albums im looking forward to the new animals as leaders though which will probably take over opeth also worth mentioning is that the reign of kindo more similar to thank you scientist and friendlier than everything else on this list is releasing new music this year as well theyre not prog metal but theyre easy to like from a prog perspective im sure im missing some stuff but this is from memory if youre interested in listening to other progrockmetal stuff its not all metal or straight prog but i built it to have some music that proglovers might like ie the reign of kindo hiromi tigran hamasyan snarky puppy kiev etc also visit rprogmetal its one of my favorite subs because people are chill and just want to talk about the music they love there are a series of posts being built currently that will attempt to subdivide prog metal to make it more approachable so check out those too
technology,not_removed,i actually added cold war and china because of uzenopus reply
technology,not_removed,thats the point i made to my mate earlier hes set on apple moving towards wireless and pushing future standards thats fine but at the moment i cant even use apple products with apple products feel free to put one or two usbc ports on but dont remove everything i currently use as it essentially bricks everything i have i now will be going with another manufacturer that looks me to use my equipment edit sorry lost the context of the point there ive always loved apples pushing of standards and am an owner of macbooks iphones and ipads praising decisions at every opportunity this is way too aggressive for my liking this product might work in another years but not now
technology,not_removed,usbc is the future and i applaud apple on taking the risk and attempting to set the standard that said i wont be buying any of their products anytime soon
technology,not_removed,nexus owner here i for one welcome our usbc overlords one cable for everything bidirectional and reversible connection will be glorious but right now its frustrating
technology,not_removed,not everyone has access to proper database systems everyone has access to excel that said the amount of business critical we have to close the company if we cant get it back excel files i had to restore from backups thank god for roaming profiles or those people would store that stuff locally without any backups
technology,not_removed,they did we have here and rolled out just this past summer
technology,not_removed,agreed i had ubuntu on a micro sd card for when i needed it
technology,not_removed,agreed we have various models here and i like the toshiba chromebook for that same reason we have many users who demand a mac but all they do is mail and web and print stuff literally thats it sigh
technology,not_removed,in terms of retail a price for software would have at most markup cost for retailer retailer makes often less while a cabledongle would generally have anywhere from markup only costing to for the retailer printer cables net about as much for a retailer then the printers theyre needed for bluetooth devices are usually about margin
technology,not_removed,its working
technology,not_removed,i hate that theres no simple way to turn off updates and im running into the same bullshit i did over a decade ago when the os decides that its just going to update itself right in the middle of something i walked into work on a monday and watched as my computer spent the next hour and a half be completely unusable as the anniversary update churned itself out
technology,not_removed,windows now has an integrated bash shell i can no longer make that excuse anymore so im probably going to switch back to windows at some point in the future
technology,not_removed,you could try a linux distro like ubuntu i use it and i agree linux is a much nicer development environment when youre dealing with other linux systems which is most servers these days
technology,not_removed,yea surface pro way outperforms anything mac has and coming out whoo
technology,not_removed,i think the runs into the same ram constraints though really all i want is thunderbolt native hdmi ram as an option hours of battery life and a reasonable form factor
technology,not_removed,i third the xps best laptop on the market except for maybe the surface pro but those are really expensive
technology,not_removed,i think it must such to love os x that much right now and i get it cause i have so many designer friends who will fight before they migrate to windows but all of them were so disappointed last week it was sad many of them were ready to buy a new machine and are now considering the model
technology,not_removed,getting rid of the escape key was a huge fuck you to the devs that use macs for their native unix shell guess ms will win those devs back with their dual cml enviroment
technology,not_removed,i remember that alot of software worked only on mac or better on mac but it seems to have changed lately many of those software developers started to make the software for both operating systems especially once apple started using intelamd architecture processors now all i hear lately is how much faster tasks are on windows
technology,not_removed,yeah because years ago apple used a superior graphics bus then agp came around and leveled the playing field graphics houses are all stuck on an outdated notion maybe you could make an argument that they prefer os x or a suite of programs that run native on os x its just a weird niche
technology,not_removed,youre missing the whole have been conditioned design can be done on windows and mac exactly the same but back in the day adobe focused more on their mac side of software for sales i know more video guys who use pc than mac i only know design people who use macs and just design people most artists i know use pcs
technology,not_removed,apparently microsoft are working on a surface phone not sure what the release times are gonna be like but itll be interesting to see how it compares to the pixel
technology,not_removed,as an apple hater the time has come
technology,not_removed,i preordered the xl and i love every second of it it takes a little bit of time to switch from ios to android but youll love it before you know it i would go on but i think you understand lol edit i forgot to mention how stoked i am for the vr headset it will probably be around years at the earliest before apple makes one lol
technology,not_removed,i have a mac for work and in almost every way i dont like it compared to my windows laptop the sole exception is the charging port that magnet shit literally saved my mac yesterday when i tripped over the cable and it didnt fly out i cannot believe they decided to get rid of the thing i most liked about it
technology,not_removed,magsafestyle charging has saved the life of many a surface in my gaming group the hosts toddler hasnt figured out that shuffling is a good way to trip over cables magnetic cable just pops right out without damaging the computer or pulling it off the table toddler only staggers instead of face planting and everyone is happy
technology,not_removed,im sure the justification involves shaving a fraction of a mm off the design
technology,not_removed,for the night is dark and full of terror
technology,not_removed,you cant lock up the darkness
technology,not_removed,hello darkness my old friend
technology,not_removed,the company that made the white headphone silhouette its iconic look for years and years did away with them in the name of courage
technology,not_removed,i miss my nano so much it was the perfect form factor i have an original gen ipod that i like a lot because it can run rockbox which allows lossless playback as well as a nice big graphic equalizer all things my really super old iriver could do back when they looked like ipods too bad the screen got smashed i particularly liked the iriver because not only could it run rockbox but the hdd form factor was laptop size so every several years when new generations came out i could just upgrade the drive for cheap and massive storage increase i like to keep my entire music library with me so i never really liked flash players
technology,not_removed,i wonder how large is that population i feel alone in my need for physical interfaces in electronics so much but
technology,not_removed,im still using my sandisk clip theyre cheap sound good and have good battery life theres no way i am giving up tactile buttons to pause play which you cant do on a phone unless you buy one of those headphones with a remote in them
technology,not_removed,if nothing else how many people lean on their computer friend to help pick a laptop
technology,not_removed,plus the dell xps is just as thin as the macbook pros and matches it or out performs it across the board macbook pros have little bit better battery life but not by much the xps is more powerful has ports a dope display touchscreen and a bezel the list goes on plus if you really want to use the mac os you can just follow a guide and make it a hackintosh i was on the apple train a couple years ago the macbook pros were awesome back then but not it seems like apple has established a stupidly loyal customer base that just buys whatever they churn out i plan on continuing to see apples all over campus
technology,not_removed,doesnt matter if every creative agency you go you use exclusively macs
technology,not_removed,i actually know one of the guys partly responsible for that design he drinks a lot were still friends so i just try to work the phrase white o rings into every conversation i can
technology,not_removed,to be fair a car cooling system and a pc component water cooling system work very much the same theyre hardly rocket science
technology,not_removed,does it use dexcool
technology,not_removed,in those days computers came with enough ports to securely screw a piece of wood to them thanks apple
technology,not_removed,this is really cool but depressing
technology,not_removed,plenty of the cases on ebay and people make laser cut io plates for modding so you dont have to do the worst of it yourself planning on doing a dead my dad has at some point
technology,not_removed,look up the fractal define or
technology,not_removed,you dont want to spend three grand on outdated hardware
technology,not_removed,crazy sony still exists just buried underneath all the cruft
technology,not_removed,i cant believe im defending microsoft but theyve seriously been killing it the past few years
technology,not_removed,hello you are my kind of people i would simply like to say that i recommend you check out the soundtrack to the new doom videogame its one of the most perfectly realized and appropriate videogame soundtracks thats my wheelhouse ever conceived and the production chops are a tasty tasty treat also quickbrag i went to a keyboardist camp this summer and got to literally hang out with jordan rudess of dreamtheater as well as diego tejeida of haken ultra chill dudes
technology,not_removed,group policy editor also if your wifi you can turn on metered connection mode on that network it will stop any and all microsoft updates downloads
technology,not_removed,because thats the only pro it has
technology,not_removed,ive been using a surface book for the last months only thing i really wish it had was sketch the app xcode and imessage everything else is really nice
technology,not_removed,the surface book maxes at ram plus mini display port so an xps might be a better fit for you thats really the beauty of windows youre not stuck with models
technology,not_removed,especially once apple started using intelamd architecture processors exactly powerpc was part of what kept macs as something different and actually gave them the upper hand in exclusivity between software suites now developers dont have to worry as much between different architectures and can easily develop for both oss then you end up with the same software on both systems except you can get the same performance out of a pc for a third of the cost anyone who still tries to say that mac is best for blah blah is just talking out of their conditioned ass
technology,not_removed,the new surfaces have the same style of port source have and i too have been blessed by the magnetic port
technology,not_removed,im a windows user almost entirely i do have an older macbook pro that i got because it was cheap at the time and i needed a decent laptop there is not a trackpad on earth that can fuck with the trackpad on the macbook pro ive had laptops from damn near every manufacturer and that is the one thing apple absolutely nails
technology,not_removed,if youre saying we should burn all apple products to appease the one true god then i agree
technology,not_removed,in the name of obsessivecompulsive disorder
technology,not_removed,this is the same reason feature phones are still a huge market in japan you can do things without looking at your device
technology,not_removed,to be honest i wish tactile keyboards were still a thing on cell phones too
technology,not_removed,of nontech savvy people
technology,not_removed,if nothing else how many people lean on their computer friend to help pick a laptop exactly every social circle has that guy or gal thats into technology and holds some persuasion with purchases were not always the defining decision makers but we obviously play a part but perhaps apple intends to play that role themselves now with their retail presence theyll be that nice helping friend there to make a recommendation like the apple employee who tried recommending i lease a new mac pro to replace the old one i bought in great idea except my old mac pro from is the new mac pro
technology,not_removed,is the drinking what caused the design problem or did the design problems cause the drinking
technology,not_removed,just dont try that on a
technology,not_removed,nice back when i was looking at modding one it was all diy and i couldnt justify buying the tools and cost to do it of course now i realise that any excuse to buy more tools is a good one i was young and foolish
technology,not_removed,i have the best case ive had so much space for cable management and water cooling
technology,not_removed,sony used to make all the best electronics now they have the playstation and a few decent tvs wouldnt recommend any of their other products
technology,not_removed,thats because microsoft started doing what apple did a few years ago and they started after ballmer left through the surface line they took the alreadyexisting slate pc and made it better thats what apple has always been good at making existing technology easier to use and more accessible ms had it rough for the first and second generation surface pros but i think they really hit it with the pro and now other windows oems are following suit with their own versions of the surface concept which is just fantastic there were examples of slate pcs before the surface but the concept was nowhere near as refined as much as id love to see apples take on it i dont expect to see them jump into that market their answer was the ipad pro which is the device that made me realize that apple doesnt have any idea what pro means anymore its just really unfortunate to see coming from the company that brought us the ipod but theyre not leaders anymore theyre followers
technology,not_removed,the nonpro versions dont have this regedit has to be used instead edit winaero tweaker is good for some of the function of gpe though
technology,not_removed,they should contact samsung on how to turn up the burn
technology,not_removed,its hard to tell really i think it was just kind of a concurrent phenomenon
technology,not_removed,its a small portion of their sales but they still have some decent high end car audio available their dead head decks used to be the shit back in the day solid copper boards gold connection over gauged jumpers etc
technology,not_removed,they make a huge amount of camera modules for smartphones too its easy to forget though because so much of the camera quality is determined by the software controlling the module
technology,not_removed,their cameras are awesome partly due to their monopoly on autofocus zeiss lenses
technology,not_removed,their camera sensors are top class on many phones though
technology,not_removed,their mirrorless cameras are definitely leading the way
technology,not_removed,their flagship phones are pricey but awesome too
technology,not_removed,sony makes some of the best mirrorless cameras and their camera sensors are used in apple and samsung phones as well as fujifilm and olympus cameras their phone cameras suck though too many mp soo small sensor size the software also sucks it seems their camera department does not work with the phone one
technology,not_removed,he said appease the one true god not blow up kings landing
technology,not_removed,they make most of their money off of insurance
technology,not_removed,no no no the zeiss lenses are fine if not overpriced but it has little to nothing to do with their recent success the reason theyre kicking ass is because sony and panasonic are the only companies innovating their lineups right now the series has won over many pros who used to shoot canon and nikon and the apsc lineup has stolen many entrylevel users for their high quality solid video excellent form factor and easy ability to adapt lenses to top it all off sony is kicking ass in the video department as well the and the are ubiquitous on most indie shoots and youll even see them kicking around as b and c cams on larger productions zeiss is great but sonys recent success is all about their willingness to supply users with pro features for a fair price and not alienate people who use other brands source year canon user who is moving to sony
technology,not_removed,apple has a point here
technology,not_removed,ive been a paying spotify subscriber for several years and still am and cant think of a single app update that has been an improvement just updates that have been different for the sake of being different you changed your trademark green ok how about my various playlists that are now blanknull because you no longer have rights to the music
technology,not_removed,does netflix give apple proceeds of subscriptions
technology,not_removed,however if a customer chooses to sign up for a digital product outside of the app store the developer does not pay us anything and their content will still work inside of apple devices so they have the most anticonsumer and developer policies ive ever seen
technology,not_removed,confusednetflix doesnt have this issue
technology,not_removed,apple pays has to pay of every purchase this is so unfair 😟
technology,not_removed,how is this any different from other pay models that encourage buyers to pay a certain way for example companies that offer cash discounts to avoid paying credit card merchant fees or companies that offer discounts for automated payments to avoid paying a party call center
technology,not_removed,not really the spotify app is free the level of service is determined by your subscription why cant they tell you the feature is not supported at your subscription level
technology,not_removed,what point do they have apple is pretending that their customers iphone in which their customer paid for with an absolutely insane markup is really only a tool to serve apples interests not the customer who bought and paid for it its justification oh well it bundled with an app that apple labored immensely on oh and that happen to force all customers to use the app if they want a functioning phone what a load of horseshit
technology,not_removed,everybody else does it isnt a good defense spotify found a work around and apple is pissed
technology,not_removed,no they dont if they were standing on the moral high ground they might have a point but they arent they are scumbag spongers expecting to skim off a percentage of everything that goes through their system exactly like some century telecoms company there is absolutely no reason why a clients customers should not be able to sign up for a phone service using their pcs apple has got you so brainwashed youre defending a monopolist who is also a dictator talking about money this is the same company which funnels sales through ireland and other tax havens and it refuses to repatriate the profits so they can be rightfully taxed no apple are scumbags and assholes and i for one will never ever buy an apple device there will always be plenty of fools and morons who love to stuff their money into apples taxfree offshore money warehouses so their future is assured but holy moly apple is one of the most despicable companies of all time
technology,not_removed,explain to me how apple is making a valid point the fact that apple gets a cut of the subscription fee simply by a customer signing up through the app is clearly uncompetitive spotify is a business the need to recoup that cost and would need to raise the price of their subscriptions to do so this would in turn make apple music more attractive to customers how can you argue that this isnt anticompetitive
technology,not_removed,apple is run by collectivists with android there is a free market of app stores so if one rejects an app other can accept it ayn rand would be ashamed of apple
technology,not_removed,the relevant part of the story is this spotify apparently offered a promotion to users who signed up for the service on its website rather than within the app which would require the music streaming company to share some of the revenue with apple netflix doesnt try to offer a discount if you bypass apple
technology,not_removed,i think theres a clear wrong of not letting people install apps from where every they want this wouldnt be an issue if apple didnt force people to only get apps through the app store
technology,not_removed,its entirely possible that apple music is paying just apple itself large corporations often do this one division pays a nominal fee to the parent company or to another division as part of accounting or legal requirements
technology,not_removed,they absolutely do a store always takes a cut of the products they sell no a store buys a product for x and sells it for y keeping the difference as profit this is different than taking a cut stores do not use this agency pricing apple has invented because it very very very quickly can run afoul of antitrust laws as apple found out with ebooks further this revenue share is extremely high nothing outside of app stores get this level compensation and the only reason apple and not now google can get away with charging this obscene level of pricing is their prohibition on alternative app stores this is known as a monopoly and monopolies are the reason for antitrust laws in a competitive environment the service an app store provided would never be valued at over and more likely it would be similar to any other payment system closer to
technology,not_removed,competition
technology,not_removed,many major credit cards have in their merchant agreement a stipulation saying that the merchant agrees not to give cash discounts or otherwise penalize credit card use its just that its way harder for card companies to police this compared to apple and online compliance
technology,not_removed,why cant they
technology,not_removed,i dont know why youre being downvoted this is clearly the case apple treats iphones like an extension to the app store as if every iphone will always still be theirs
technology,not_removed,i hope you dont use android either because google also takes a percentage of sales through their app store they also have off shore tax havens in ireland so does microsoft
technology,not_removed,imagine walking into your local mall and heading into gamestop to advertise and sell your own game that you spent years of sweat and tears creating you are passionate about it and you figure the best place to sell it and get of the profit is at a gaming store with people who like to play games unfortunately gamestop owns that space and if you want to sell your game with the convenience of their location and audience youre going to have to give them a cut
technology,not_removed,most of the world is ashamed of ayn rand
technology,not_removed,it wasnt even a promotion the screenshot just shows a message that a feature is limited to premium subscribersit doesnt say anything about where to how to subscribe
technology,not_removed,is it any different than checking out in the ebay app using paypal why cant apps implement subscription checkout methods using paypal to bypass apples inapp method
technology,not_removed,but people dont feel forced they feel protected of mobile malware is on android because theres so much shit floating around from different stores the market has spoken and the closed curated app store is what people want
technology,not_removed,so youre saying its entirely possible that theyre not doing so too
technology,not_removed,google also charges of the app price different for subscriptions
technology,not_removed,that is what apple is upset about apple wants that notification to have a way to purchase or upgrade the subscription from within the app so they get a cut the problem is there are a ton of apps like this does apple get a cut of all the free apps ad revenue no do they get a cut of office subscriptions no this seems to be more about itunes competition than anything else
technology,not_removed,theres a huge difference google allows developers to use other payment options in the app apple doesnt youre not even allowed to tell the user there are other options outside the app which is really insane why do you think spotify and others are complaining about apple but not google
technology,not_removed,except apple is doing nothing to deserve a cut here they dont provide the payment platform used and the hosting isnt expensive enough to motivate the cut either
technology,not_removed,just because apple does it to every doesnt make it legalcompetitive its actually an argument that apple fleeces everyone apple music is still either exempt from this fee or it goes to the parent company so apple is still benefiting from uncompetitive behaviour
technology,not_removed,except free apps are prominent so no this analogy doesnt work thousands of free apps with ads make money that apple doesnt see a dime of spotify is a subscription service not a one time in app purchase another example for work i have office i can download the office apps for free but cant connect to a account and have full use of features unless i already have a subscription
technology,not_removed,the retail model is a little tough to use for analogy here since game developers sell their games to gamestop and gamestop resells them apples cut is more like ebay taking a fee
technology,not_removed,your analogy only works if there is only one store that is allowed to sell video games in the mall and anyone who wants to buy a video game at the mall is forced to shop at that gamestop which is guaranteed that it will never face competition within the mall
technology,not_removed,its more like gamestop owns the mall and eb games sets up shop in that mall selling the exact same products gamestop can offer lower prices because their cost is partially covered by collecting rent from eb maybe eb sets up a website to sell games and ship them from a nearby distribution center at a more competitive price when they try to advertise this in the store gamestop throws a fit because they deserve their slice of the pie for having to maintain the only shopping mall in town
technology,not_removed,you dare speak against god
technology,not_removed,did paypal fund the development of the store does paypal pay for the server farm the electricity bill the colos the massively redundant internet connections the ongoing maintenance the employees that keep it up the deal with apple isnt a bad one theyll host your app for free if its free if you make money off of it they want a cut
technology,not_removed,you can only get apps from apple apps sold via the app store have a cut taken from in app subscriptions spotify can refuse to sell subscriptions in their app but that makes it easier to switch to apple music which is already installed and has a painless way to sign up their options are limited either take a cut or refuse to offer subscriptions at all within the apl
technology,not_removed,but people dont feel forced they feel protected it is sad when people give up freedom for security inevitably they will lose both and deserve neither
technology,not_removed,it doesnt make a net difference either way
technology,not_removed,in canada its against the law to charge more based on payment type
technology,not_removed,wrong atleast at the federal level due to a court settlement terms took effect on jan merchants are allowed to charge a credit card fee upto provided is not prohibited by state law which some states have prohibition on these types of surcharges it is no longer part of merchant agreements however source httpknowyourcardorgarticlescheckoutfees source httpwwwncslorgresearchfinancialservicesandcommercecreditordebitcardsurchargesstatutesaspx
technology,not_removed,apple wants that notification to have a way to purchase or upgrade the subscription from within the app so they get a cut what notification what are you even talking about the problem is there are a ton of apps like this does apple get a cut of all the free apps ad revenue no thats because theyre not subscriptions they dont take a cut of ad sales they take a cut of subscriptions do they get a cut of office subscriptions no uh they do they literally do
technology,not_removed,apple music is still either exempt from this fee or it goes to the parent company so apple is still benefiting from uncompetitive behaviour wouldnt the counterargument be that spotify should create its own smartphone and app store ecosystem if it wants to control those portions
technology,not_removed,i was going to reply with roughly the same answer physical retail and app stores are so different plus there is competition built into the retail model in that there are other retail spaces for the consumer to go and see if there is better pricing apple is effectively holding the consumer and developer hostage by saying you can only sign up through the app and thus ensuring they get their or the ever giving god of being in the store a year
technology,not_removed,so the play store doesnt sell spotify what about spotifycom can you get a subscription there hint yes
technology,not_removed,classic american response
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,what notification there is a screenshot of the notification in question in the middle of the page article this post is linked to uh they do i was wrong on this they do get if the subscription is purchased through the app but not if the subscription is bought on spotify doesnt want to develop a way for the users to buy a subscription directly from their app like microsoft did they just want to tell them the feature is unavailable at their subscription level in the end they could probably get more sales but they might not make enough of a margin to support the sale with apple scalping a third of the revenue
technology,not_removed,that is a patently stupid argument youre saying that every app maker that wants to be treated fairly would need to create a smartphone years after the market has been made near impossible to make a dent into apple and androids dominance how about instead we make the app field balanced and equal and allow the consumer to decide which apps they want to use instead of forcing their hand through anticompetitive tactics like apples if google does the same in their app store fuck them too
technology,not_removed,no even in brick and mortar retail the more apt analogy is that most retailers pay their landlord a percentage of their sales as a part of their rent providing a platform on which to do business and then collecting a percentage of that business is an old model and its common and widespread apple isnt the first to do it and there absolutely nothing wrong or illegal about it
technology,not_removed,pretend walmart is the only way to get food in the northeast united states the only outlet for heinz to sell their ketchup in that area now pretend walmart says heinz either stop selling your ketchup in our stores or give us of the price of the ketchup meanwhile heinz is only making a little bit of profit after buying the tomatoes the bottles and manufacturing and shipping their product that is what apple is doing your analogy neglects to mention the fact that spotify has no other avenue to sell their subscription on the iphone they cant even use their own payment system within the app if apple allowed you to install apps from outside the app store allowed you to implement your own payment system or stopped taking from subscriptions this wouldnt be an issue tldr your analogy doesnt sucks it doesnt tell the whole story and i still think its unfair of apple to use their position in the smartphone market to make their music service more attractive
technology,not_removed,please explain why should walmart be forced to allow costco kiosks in thier stores at no cost
technology,not_removed,wow you sounds like an ass you do understand that amex has some of the highest fees in the business and your transaction probally cost that business some where around in bank fees ofcourse since you are likely an ass i am sure you do not care one bit i was on the other end of the transaction as a small business owner operating a razor thin margins where many times the credit card companies where making more money off a sale than i was i sold that business before the new rules took effect but if i could have i would have charged a fee for credit card transactions ive never been to a place that charged for accepting a credit card ofcourse not consumers are conditioned to not have to pay the fees so in most instances they have continued on as normal i have however been seeing more and more minimums for using a card even at larger stores that is now also allowed under the new rules this say dicks that want to charge can be properly told to fuck off any time it happens id just file a dispute with amex and theyd refund the fee to me anyway so it was never a big deal if you do that today amex might refund the fee but they will no longer be allowed to charge that back to the merchant amex might eat that cost to retain your business that is fine my credit union refunds some out of network atm fees for that reason but the fees are still being collected and retained by the merchant i had them all printed out so i could show the minimum wage employee why they cant refuse my american express charge or risk losing the ability to accept credit cards all together ohh and as a final note they were never at risk of losing the ability to process all credit cards at most you could have gotten the amex merchant agreement terminated which means they could not take amex no big loss after amex decided to raise their rate by a good deal over visamc i choose voluntarily to stop taking amex did not lose a single customer over it visamc are the bigger networks businesses can survive just fine with out discover or amex
technology,not_removed,seems like a high cut of profits
technology,not_removed,spotify has already developed that and the last version of the app uses it they just took it out in the new one
technology,not_removed,how about instead we make the app field balanced and equal and allow the consumer to decide which apps they want to use except the rule spotify is bitching about applies equally to every single application submitted to store including apples own
technology,not_removed,i have never seen a business that pays a portion of proceeds as rent rent is always a static number make no money rent is still due in full make a boatload exactly the same amount of rent is due dont even move in to your store rent is due rent is not even close to taking a percentage rent would be like saying give us a static amount of money a month to have your app in our shop
technology,not_removed,no they lease the space regardless of their sales maybe once the lease is up that store has to renegotiate the terms and their sales could possibly impact those negotiations but ive never heard your model being used plus in your model apple is acting as landlord and place of business once again apple is acting in an anticompetitive manner by setting themselves up with an advantage in that they dont need to pay any fees this would be the case with any premium pay for apps in which apple has a competitive app
technology,not_removed,now pretend walmart says heinz either stop selling your ketchup in our stores or give us of the price of the ketchup there is a big fucking difference between telling heinz to stop selling ketchup or give us and telling heinz if you want to start selling ketchup at our store pay us spotify has been giving apple a cut since the beginning and they agreed to that up front also apple isnt the only grocery store they have a global market share
technology,not_removed,it drops to after one year
technology,not_removed,even if that fee does apply to apple apps it would go to apple so it is a moot point its like me owning a property with two store fronts that both sell the same product one is owned by you and the other is owned by me now i charge of all your sales as a fee for using the store front we both sell our product at so i get for every unit that i sell and for every one that you sell how is that fair and competitive im gaming the system by acting as retailer and landlord
technology,not_removed,allow the consumer to decide which apps they want to use instead of forcing their hand through anticompetitive tactics the store is exactly the problem theyd be on equal grounds if you could just install the app from the spotify store but apple uses antiuser tactics and forces you to their app store
technology,not_removed,sorry but this is extremely common in retail real estate just because you arent familiar with the industry doesnt make it untrue its how pretty much every shopping mall strip mall and other leasedout retail space operates edit as a source as a part of my job ive often helped retailers build and use tools they can use to report their sales to their landlords
technology,not_removed,nope many retailers in many parts of the country pay a percentage of their gross sales to their landlord as a portion of their rent you can deny this all you want but its true and you have no basis on which to base your denial im not even sure why im arguing with you about it you clearly dont have any clue what youre talking about
technology,not_removed,places that try and pass on the cost of business to their consumers are moronic all business pass the costs to the customer that is the only way business works and yes theft is factored in to the price of your goods what you want it for the reset of the consumers to subsidize your ability to use your preferred payment method instead of having to be responsible for those costs yourself you want everyone to pay for you either way i never pay a fee ever yes you do it is hidden from you for example lets say stores sell the same widget store a price for the widget no matter how you pay store b price but has a cash discount of store c price but as a credit card surcharge of if you are paying by credit card each place is the exact same price and each merchant will likely get the exact same net revenue from the sale stores a and b simply raised their gross prices to accommodate the credit card fee store c refuses to subsidizes credit card shoppers and prices their goods at the actual cost of course this is a very basic example because different cards have different rates even when using the same network visa mc amex a rewards card will often have higher interchange fees than nonrewards cards and there are of variations on fees the banks are able to make billions because these fees are hidden away and customers like you are extremely ignorant to the process personally i think all business should charge the exact fee that card is charging them as a separate line item it should be treated as a tax then consumers will start demanding and using cards with the lowest fees
technology,not_removed,it should be at most for year one and there after
technology,not_removed,except ios is their ecosystem you cant sideload games onto you cant get google maps anywhere else but the play store apple is perfectly within their right to restrict sales on their platform to their store
technology,not_removed,even if what you say is true apple would still be gaming the system to make their apps more profitable which is anticompetitive hell if microsoft is considered anticompetitive simply by including only ie when they ship windows how can anyone argue with a clear conscience that apple isnt being anticompetitive in this situation
technology,not_removed,well apple and spotify are not even in the brick and mortar retail environment so i agree there is no need for this argument as it doesnt pertain to the topic
technology,not_removed,my thoughts exactly
technology,not_removed,why it should be whatever apple wants its a free market and its their store no one gave a shit when the app store was small and spotify has a few hundred thousand subscribers now that ios and the app store are successful and added millions of subscribers to spotify they want special treatment and a bigger slice of the revenue
technology,not_removed,except you can get google maps and pretty much every other android app from elsewhere there are several websites that are devoted to apk downloads and sideload them on to an android device you dont have to use google play at all
technology,not_removed,but its my device i should be able to do what ever i want with it bell labs was broken up microsoft got slammed for monopoly apple should be next
technology,not_removed,microsoft was a monopolist in the os market and thats why they got hit apple is no monopolist in the smartphone market hint android
technology,not_removed,fuck ms did not get sued for bundling ie that was the clickbait headline ms got sued for threatening oems such as dell hp and gateway with increased licensing fees if they were to bundle netscape in new computers so that ie would be the only bundled browser and therefore the default
technology,not_removed,but no updates
technology,not_removed,imagine knowing months in advance what the fed is doing
technology,not_removed,federal reserve is a private corporation that was illegally setup in controls our money and has never been audited
technology,not_removed,hillarys fault
technology,not_removed,privately owned regional branches owned by whom
technology,not_removed,perhaps we should audit the fed and find out
technology,not_removed,the fed has long viewed transparency as a fundamental principle of central banking that supports accountability source then the records represent only a slice of all cyber attacks on the fed because they include only cases involving the washingtonbased board of governors a federal agency that is subject to public records laws reuters did not have access to reports by local cybersecurity teams at the central banks privately owned regional branches here exists the slippery slope of having a dichotomy of accountability the washingtonbased is subject to public records laws but the regionals are not i submit this dualstandard the washingbased board is subject to public records law but the regional banks are not is hypocrisy as applied security breaches anywhere within the federal reserve system should be matters of public concern and brought to light and what may be an evergrowing wall of insulation to transparency to wit creating this artificial dichotomy of public vs private from a freedom on information aspect will only hurt them and eventually the public
technology,not_removed,too bad none of the breaches gave the public more information on what goes on in there
technology,not_removed,probably just the nsa or the fbi or the cia or an intelligence or law enforcement organization of an allied nation
technology,not_removed,i am curious on which grounds you consider them illegally set up not arguing against you i have just never seen that charge before
technology,not_removed,i like how people downvote something thats true at least somewhat the fed is certainly private and definitely controls our money and they certainly arent audited properly
technology,not_removed,plus the federal reserve notes are not money they have no value
technology,not_removed,i count lies
technology,not_removed,when the federal reserve was created in there was a compromise between lawmakers who wanted a public institution and those who wanted a completely private one so the federal reserve board in dc is public with its board members appointed by the president but the regional banks are private since a majority of their board members are selected by the banks in that region
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,oh for fucks sake the fed is already thoroughly audited in the usual sense by an independent inspector general and by an outside accounting firm currently deloitte and touche and the resulting financial are made public online every security owned by the fed up to the detail of the identifying cusip number is also httpnyappsnewyorkfedorgmarketssomasysopenaccholdingshtml online moreover the government accountability office gao which does indepth httpwwwfederalreservegovnewseventsreformauditgaohtm and analyses audits of a different type of government activities at the request of congress has wide latitude to review fed operations including supervision and regulation as well as other functions all of these calls by rand company to audit the fed are a bunch of political grandstanding aimed at undereducated tea party conspiracy theorists
technology,not_removed,how would auditing the fed improve security not that it matters since everything is released anyways and is audited by several institutions
technology,not_removed,botnets are cheap when youre as rich as the people behind the fed edit case in point
technology,not_removed,perhaps you would find the httpsenwikipediaorgwikifiatmoney to be informative and interesting
technology,not_removed,and the hackers will pay for it
technology,not_removed,snippet from a recent article about fed audits current law exempts from audit transactions with foreign central banks and foreign governments actions surrounding monetary policy matters transactions made under the direction of the federal open market committee the fomc which sets interest rates as well as communication by federal reserve board members officers and other employees about such exempt transactions and actions so yeah theyre audited but the interesting stuff is exempt
technology,not_removed,i will play devils advocate for you here lets say that this is correct and all above board what harm would letting another federal reserve audit happen cause they all are legit anyways and it would appease a lot of people and quite frankly for the sake of people like you that believe that the oversight is already well covered it would shut up the people that say it isnt as for me personally i would like to see it because i would be curious to see the ins and outs of business of the people that have their finger on the pulse of the worlds largest and most powerful economy just because i find that kind of shit interesting
technology,not_removed,well it could give us an idea of who the fed is dealing with so that we can make sure that security is good on their end of course that would probably need to wait until after they fixed their own security just to add not entirely why i would want the fed audited but hey its a foot in the door
technology,not_removed,i will watch later after work
technology,not_removed,hes saying its that money type thing that isnt itself valuable ie paper cotton and ink but holds value because people take it for stuff
technology,not_removed,the fed is designed to be insulated somewhat from the prevailing winds of political opinion im not saying that its perfect or immune to corruption but there are reasons for its structure and oversight
technology,not_removed,that doesnt make any sense what does the balance sheet and the minutes of the fomc both publicly available have anything to do with cyber security
technology,not_removed,the fed is already highly regulated despite the intent to create a semiindependent body a steady hand on the economic tiller if you will that is at least partially insulated from the whims of political trends see my post above for more details
technology,not_removed,gold itself enjoys value not because its intrinsically valuable shininess and conductivity aside but because of public consensus that its a suitable medium of exchange and store of value theres nothing magic about having a nucleus with protons
technology,not_removed,the econ term is fiat money
technology,not_removed,the fed is designed to be insulated somewhat from the prevailing winds of political opinion im not saying that its perfect or immune to corruption but there are reasons for its structure and oversight audits occur by definition after the fact they expose what happened and perhaps offer a slight bit of insight into why they dont prescribe what should happen the fed is independent because its governing structure is insulated from the prevailing winds of political opinion not because no one knows what theyre doing
technology,not_removed,maybe he is referring to a safety and soundness it audit
technology,not_removed,okay you got me it was really just a tongue in cheek sarcastic segway into the belief that the fed should be audited so heres your s for context
technology,not_removed,this is the same concept behind cryptocurrencies having value theyre valuable because people say they are
technology,not_removed,when people say audit the fed they have something very specific in mind and this doesnt have anything to do with it
technology,not_removed,what the hell are you talking about
technology,not_removed,when you base a currency on something with limited availability you cant proceed to print silly amounts of that currency to fund wars iraq and companies like halliburton goldman rothschilds etc i dont think a gold standard exactly prevents legislatures from financing wars with debt as this shows the us incurred substantial public debt to finance many wars both before and after bretton woods its not like inflation or fiat currency actually helps anyone working a real job in the nonfinancial private sectorquite the opposite this is a contested point among economists the gist of debate as i understand it is that there are costs to inflation shoeleather costs menu costs increased variability of relative pricing etc however many economists argue that the costs of reducing inflation can be quite large on the order of of gdp to reduce inflation by point in addition this cost is not spread equitably over the population the fall in aggregate income is on the backs of workers who lose their jobs one of the great empirical insights of modern economics is the shortterm tradeoff between inflation and unemployment the phillips curve look you seem like an inquisitive person but most of the arguments youre presenting are extremely onesided and were debunked long ago by mainstream economics i have held strong opinions on economicpolitical topics for years but my opinions took a big overhaul a few years ago when i bit the bullet and read an economics textbook from cover to cover previously i pretty much only read popular books on specific topics most of them advocating for a particular conservative point of view secrets of the temple books by thomas sowell etc many of my viewpoints were changed completely and not necessarily in a more conservative or liberal direction sorry if this comes across as condescending but i honestly recommend that you invest some time and read a textbook in micromacro is a popular choice he devotes entire chapters to the us monetary system inflation and central banking and the last chapter presents a series of debates over current macroeconomic policy describing both sides one of them about is whether central banks should aim for zero inflation
technology,not_removed,well when i say audit the fed in this context that is what im referring to doesnt make you sound any less of an idiot mr big tough internet guy
technology,not_removed,i thought i was discussing me being sarcastic about auditing the federal reserve why do you care so damn much
technology,not_removed,what do you do for a living
technology,not_removed,it isnt my fault that people are ambiguous and that i choose the most likely meaning given the subject matter
technology,not_removed,the problem is there have been audit the fed bills pushed by untrusting people for a while ron paul was big on it i recall those were exclusively about financial dealings and wouldnt have done anything remotedly related to security so when someone proposes auditing the fed its pretty automatic to assume you are referring to the kind of audit congressman have been pushing because its not like the fed isnt audited at all they do have some audits people ahve just not been satisfied with the depth or breadth of the information
technology,not_removed,i mean you could back peddle that is your prerogative doesnt make you sound any less of an idiot
technology,not_removed,im a software developer ive worked in a few sectors education manufacturing and for the last few years environmental assessmentremediation im a little old for grad school now but if i could do it over gain id probably try to do research in environmental economics so many fascinating problems
technology,not_removed,there are sectors public and private if your money comes from doing something honest that produces something real and not using your intelligence to swindleextort others you would be able to explain everything above in simpler terms the exact same way i explained the concept of fixed currencies but look at how complicated you get attempting to discredit people who know the govt and central bank banking cartel fuck over the common man by printing money out of thin air i know the austrian schools weaknesses i know keynes friedman etc better than you likely i have a minor in econ major in phil masters in biz admin you either work for the govt get paid by the govt or depend on the govt if you think any part of the financial system is too big to fail the rest of us will be putting you on a list in years and getting our revenge for your support of quantitative easing and making us work to support your pathetic useless lives assuming you benefit from qe
technology,not_removed,wow sorry i didnt explain things to your liking glad to know that your many degrees including that allimportant econ minor render you an expert on complex economic matters and even more importantly a moral authority fit to judge our pathetic useless lives
technology,not_removed,buddy i think you might need some psychological help im not an expert on economics or politics and im willing to hear opinions different from my own if youd like to present evidence rather than just attacking me personally id be willing to hear your opinions by the way i grew up poorer than hell and i dont work for the government were gonna eat you and your family someday for dinner ha ha okay internet toughguy

technology,not_removed,hm i wonder if the largest bank in japan third largest in world joining ripples multinational steering committee has any connection to this httpwwwcryptocoinsnewscommufgrippleblockchain s also its taken several years but ripple has finally reached efficient and scalable transaction throughput levels of visa httpswwwcryptocoinsnewscomrippleclaimstransactionthoroughputnow
technology,not_removed,because after pestering all year you still might change your mind
technology,not_removed,i like how the do not notify me again is in just the slightest different shade of purple and on the opposite side of the apparent outlined and bolded upgrade options on the right
technology,not_removed,turning off updates finally pays off muahaha actually my work machine doesnt have automatic updates turned off at least i didnt do it maybe it has it disabled though i know some of our workstations do have and i havent gotten a single notice or pop up or whatever about
technology,not_removed,does a really good job of stopping all the upgrade bs surrounding
technology,not_removed,microsoft instead of pushing so hard why not just give people a key and say upgrade whenever you want toand give reasons people should update rather than just interrupting everything or making it frustrating for people with no pressure or urgency people would be more likely to adopt at their leisure rather than after being pissed off about something that they dont want now
technology,not_removed,seriously down voted this is directly on point someone has successfully sued microsoft over this
technology,not_removed,welp cant wait until august and i can finally turn windows update back on
technology,not_removed,im going to go against the jerk but im actually pleased with the free upgrade remember all those issues with people refusing to jump off windows xp complaining they have to pay for a new os or just complaining that their os isnt supported anymore now a thing of the past
technology,not_removed,there is a megathread for this this has already been discussed ad nauseam
technology,not_removed,the most insulting part about modern advertising is that in the past if someone wanted to pester you to buy something it was you against them they had to look you in the eye and hold out longer than you did plus if they were too obnoxious theyd just end up starting a fight now with the power of technology the marketing department has access to machines that can creatively pester you over and over without requiring any of them to actually get up thats whats really annoying
technology,not_removed,the most surprising thing is that some people still seem to believe that once microsoft has a completely captive audience that they might choose not to make use of it
technology,not_removed,if it gets too obnoxious i will switch to linux already have the in case of emergency break glass disc burnt
technology,not_removed,same with the skip this step button when creating an account or customize these settings so you arent sending everything from browsing history to local searched to microsoft they are called dark patterns used by deceitful companies that dont value customer loyalty
technology,not_removed,my autoupdates have been off since httpwwwzdnetcomarticlewhatwentwrongwithmicrosoftsaugustupdates surfaced in i used to vet every kb item before allowing them to update but when this forced upgrade crap started i just set all windows boxes i own to and put on them
technology,not_removed,enterprise editions of windows in a domain have updates managed by a central server or at least they should do if the domain is configured correctly

technology,not_removed,suprsie windows upgrade update to windows i really wouldnt put it past microsoft
technology,not_removed,doubt it the end of july will come and microsoft will say the free windows upgrade has been such a success that we will extend the free upgrade until the end of the year then probably do the same thing when that time comes up
technology,not_removed,the free upgrade is good the shoving it down your throat part that is not
technology,not_removed,nice try microsoft
technology,not_removed,im with you been using since day works fine even better than on my ancient ram media pc i run a anti spy script as a prevention but screw it let them know i watch adventure time i dont care
technology,not_removed,silence there is no independant thought here conform consume stay asleep
technology,not_removed,then dont open the thread
technology,not_removed,two things to say about that if you havent already installed it in dual boot youre not used to it you may have to spend precious time adapting from experience an cruzer blade other cheap usb will allow you to install it hella faster
technology,not_removed,linux on a disc gets outdated quickly
technology,not_removed,i guess they do get more people to send them their data this way but they really lose the computer literate people with it i remember when i installed debian they asked me if i want to send them data about which packages i use default option was no thanks so you could just skip through it without worrying so i send them their data because that was really nice of them
technology,not_removed,i turned updates off when it started restarting my computer while playing games full screen it would make a window but not steal focus not sure that would have been better while playing multiplayer games it had a timer of some minutes and if you didnt click the do it later or whatever option it would restart your computer so since i would often binge on games without looking at my desktop this shit would periodically screw up my gaming nothing quite like your text messages blowing up because youre the healer in your raid party and your uptight asian guild leader noticed you disconnected
technology,not_removed,im sure windows would be a blessing for those still running windows vista at least those machines would have a better chance of having a smooth upgrade versus trying to get some old winxp box upgraded
technology,not_removed,this hate against microsoft for upgrades was never about the os itself but that microsoft was and still is trying to strip users of their choice nope its more than that not until some of the telemetry is turned off and they allow the end user the choice of what updates they want to install and also give people the option of removing junk like cortana if they want to and no ads until then i really dont give a shit how good an os it is
technology,not_removed,not on windows tablets and phones unfortunately secure boot is locked on
technology,not_removed,so does windows on a disc thats what updates are for who knows what is going to break when i first updated to windows my cd burner couldnt burn a disc kept complaining that my drives firmware was outdated when it was the current firmware from the manufacturer
technology,not_removed,yep but what is really crazy is how microsoft used to attack google for datamining with windows its like microsoft just said fuck it and decided to try to outgoogle google while still charging for the product if youre building a pc if windows were really free i wouldnt necessarily object to what microsoft is doing but ms is trying to doubledip if treating customers who get products like android for free is immoral then treating paying customers that way is disgusting microsoft you already got paid and you said you value privacy so dont be taking private cookies from the private cookie jar
technology,not_removed,open source strategy game does the same thing and i give them their telemetry too although part of that decision comes from the fact that i can view the source code so i could actually completely verify theyre sending only harmless telemetry data and not building an advertising profile on me but yeah making it optin rather than optout absolutely goes a long way with me
technology,not_removed,the funny thing is i know people who would love to have a upgrade but nobody that wants to
technology,not_removed,youve clearly never updated linux compared to windows it can be a nightmare with all the problems you need to debug even worse for
technology,not_removed,to play the devils advocate here windows only costs about bucks if you know what you are doing and where to get it not even talking about how they let pirated windows copies update to windows
technology,not_removed,they still attack google for data mining when advertising their for business subscription they claim that google datamines your email while they dont its apples to oranges comparing mss business subscription to googles personal free service if they would honestly compare for work vs google apps for work there arent any privacy differences
technology,not_removed,i dont dispute that but for me the forced upgrades are only half the story once you do make that choice and see what kind of crap like what i said above youre stuck with that becomes the other half two separate but parallel issues
technology,not_removed,yeah im not really sure how they get away with all this shit on mobile
technology,not_removed,well ive gone through ubuntu updates that wasnt very painful although my choice is mint as it seems to feel and act more like i am familiar with im sure i am going to need my tablet ready during the update process though
technology,not_removed,its crazy to think the former god of game engines wouldnt know how to properly wipe a disk i mean when i think of hardcore programmers i just imagine them knowing all kinds of shit that i dont about computers and i type this from an encrypted linux installation which i modified to include the boot directory in order to stop someone from tampering with the kernel specifically windows malware that might contain secret drivers for readingwriting partitions and then planting a keylogger on me i guess the moral of the story is that just because someone knows how to build a car stereo doesnt mean they know how to change out the engine under the hood and for the love of god if youre going to search sensitive things dont punch them into google there are more anonymous ways to search and in the comments people are talking about microwaves i was actually thinking that microwaving an sd card would be a quick way to permanently destroy it but then i saw someone on youtube try it and the card survived data and all
technology,not_removed,why not just burn it throw it into a sea smash it to pieces
technology,not_removed,seeing as how most of their intellectual property is based upon the work john carmack did it seems incredibly juvenile to take a giant swipe at his character theyre just devaluating their own property at this point
technology,not_removed,i didnt follow the thing why did he have to delete his hard drive exactly
technology,not_removed,as someone who sides with zenimax on this and as a software engineer this is bullshit people in industry occasionally need to wipe hard drives it happens they have plenty of evidence already they didnt need to put in filler that only drags down their credibility
technology,not_removed,is he working for hilary
technology,not_removed,i was fired from a job one time because i refused to take a drug test i could have passed i was smoking dope when i got the job and passed the initial drug test just fine i just found it objectionable that they should require all the employees to submit to a drug test for no reason after the exit interview i was escorted back to my desk to get my stuff i pushed one button on my keyboard and my hard disk started eating itself my boss who was escorting me asked me how did you do that i said something like i have my ways he asked no seriously can you teach me how to do that i might need to know one of these days
technology,not_removed,if i was going to commit a felony as an it professional i sure as fuck wouldnt google how to do it from my goddamn work or home computer this kind of stretches the believability too thin my bs detector is throwing a solid yellow flag
technology,not_removed,its crazy to think the former god of game engines wouldnt know how to properly wipe a disk a lot has changed over the years simply using dban isnt always enough because ssds typically have a good amount of buffer space and cache that disk wipe tools may not have access too
technology,not_removed,book smart street smart
technology,not_removed,because burning it or throwing it into the sea dont necessarily work smashing it to pieces will work if you know what you are doing and smash the right pieces
technology,not_removed,of course they do the day after you get subpoenaed is when we all need to right such deep thinking seems to have overlooked the obvious you have heard of occams razor right forensics showing that several other drives in house were wiped that same day are also pure coincidence i know i have deleted drives numerous times after being served not
technology,not_removed,sorry but rthed is over there
technology,not_removed,yeah it seems kind of suspicious to me too its not like the guy has little or no experience in programming or anything hell he could probably whip off a program to do just that himself in a few minutes possibly in machine code
technology,not_removed,share and private lol
technology,not_removed,given that it would be almost impossible to retroactively fix all links im not surprised at the response they gave
technology,not_removed,apparently nothing on the internet is private right
technology,not_removed,links were never intended to be private i dont see what the problem is here
technology,not_removed,i suppose a problem might be this say i have an obscure web server nobody except my friends know about theres no real website there just a stub indexhtml telling people to go away but i do use it to post some files or documents for others maybe theyre songs i downloaded and just wanted to send to my friend or an internal company document relating to salary or insurance i wanted to send to my dad to ask his advice about something i send it to my dad via facebook messenger expecting this to be private its me privately sharing something with my friend family the folder file in question is not indexed anywhere on the web because no pages anywhere link to it someone would have to guess folder names at my domain to be able to find it this obscurity has allowed me to just use it as a simple dumping ground and perhaps ive become imprudent with it dumping a document that has my social security number in it by accident ideally this wouldnt matter because the folder has never been scraped because nobody would ever really find or index it except now facebook not only has the url but publicly shares it via their api to anyone in the world someone using fbapi finds my url scrapes the hidden folder structure finds personal documents social tax or incriminating photos yes i recognize security through obscurity is bad and doesnt work but people probably already believe that a link they send privately via facebook messenger ie not even a post just via messenger wouldnt be exposed to the world via facebook api the tldr is dont treat facebook messenger as private even though it appears to be communication your links urls will be exposed to the world even if you never posted them publicly google docs private servers file dumping grounds etc etc etc these can all be exposed even when sent via private messenger
technology,not_removed,if you have urls to sensitive documents the least you can do is have your web server protect them with a password
technology,not_removed,yes youre correct these are things we in rtechnology know because we deal with tech all the time your average idiot probably wont though theyll make random googledocs and when the recipient says i cant see it theyll just disable the security or set it to share with anyone who has the link because theyll assume the link is not public and why would they assume it isnt public because they just now made the document and just now changed it from private to share with anyone who has the link then they sent it to one person via facebook messenger many people will assume this is very secure since they only sent the link to one person and couldnt possibly fathom that facebook would be making that link available via its public api and honestly can you blame them
technology,not_removed,maybe because nobody wants to fork over a million bitcoins
technology,not_removed,richard stallman would frown at this
technology,not_removed,jokes on them the nsa and fbi are some on the main buyers of exploits
technology,not_removed,somethings fishy someone wants to know who are the big boys who buy such tools i guess youd better not bite the bait
technology,not_removed,can i get an awwww no nobody ok well thats all there is too it i guess
technology,not_removed,solower the price
technology,not_removed,real hackers dont hack for profit i guess the russians have a different ethic or lack of
technology,not_removed,probably because everyone on the darkside believes that the hackers is uncle sam
technology,not_removed,surely a real hacker is just anyone who hacks regardless of motive you mean white hat yes even them a lot of them do it for profit selling there services
technology,not_removed,what proof is it russia i mean rreal proof not like dnc hacked by russia because hillarys campaign started that fbi cia nsa havent officially said shit
technology,not_removed,surely you know nothing about hackers outside what you see on tv selling your skills is just lame and not what its really about titles like white hat mean nothing
technology,not_removed,shhh everything bad that happens to america is always the fault of russia china or northkorea
technology,not_removed,if you take anything that hillarythe clinton campaign says remotely seriouslyi have some very bad news
technology,not_removed,because hillarys campaign started that fbi cia nsa havent officially said shit intelligence officials have said that actually why would you think people are only saying it because her campaign says it
technology,not_removed,and i guess your a hacker how do people that spend most of there time learning a intricate and complicated skill make their money then selling your skills it what everyone does from a binman to a stock broker and of course white hat means something it have coloquial use and there for has a meaning the fact you know what i mean when i say white hat shows it mas meaning and if you dont then you might have been living under a rock for the last years
technology,not_removed,haha right remember sony north korea really hacked them
technology,not_removed,i dont thats my point
technology,not_removed,like she won the primary fair and square lol
technology,not_removed,do trump supporters know any debate tactic besides projection this is getting tiring to watch every single week
technology,not_removed,because hillarys campaign started that fbi cia nsa havent officially said shit intelligence officials have said that actually why would you think people are only saying it because her campaign says it link me to something from them you know what a botnet proxy is right
technology,not_removed,lol i could be hacking is different its a way of life not something you major in at college whitehat is a more recent term and ive been a hacker for over years long before that title was coined
technology,not_removed,feel free to tune out
technology,not_removed,if only there was some type of search engine you could use to help educate yourself on topics you know nothing about instead of being an obnoxious jackass trying to call out people smarter than you httpswwwgooglecomsearchsitesourcehpqfbirussianhackingdncoqfbirussianhackingdnc
technology,not_removed,no thanks ill wait it out for you people to pretend you never cared about politics again after the election and act like you all never worshipped trump like all the bush supporters that magically disappeared in
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,but obama caused and created isis terror attacks never happened before him s
technology,not_removed,why are you replying to me the campaign repeated what officials in intelligence stated as my links proved get lost
technology,not_removed,discourse in america is so bad if you didnt include the sarcasm tag people would really believe you said that in all honesty
technology,not_removed,officals was the only source which still looks like the fbi director hasnt said anything see the date on my article her campaign said it was russia before anyone everyone just quotes them if you read the article theres no mention of any us gov agency saying shit still havent jump off a cliff you lemming
technology,not_removed,its things said by the reigning right wing i didnt want to come off as a nut trumps vp pick was mayor of ny when happened and he said no terrorist attacks happened before obama came into office
technology,not_removed,the news has this circle jerk thing where someone says something and the media will talk about it then the person that originally said would then quote the article or video
technology,not_removed,wake up sheeple even though intelligence sources have said it as well as security researchers how dare the clinton camp repeat what theyve been told
technology,not_removed,find a source before then where an official said it was russia
technology,not_removed,find a source before then where an official said it was russia i gave you literally thousands of news stories where officials stated all the evidence pointed to russia and you can find stories on security experts tracing the evidence in the leaks to show they came from russia too or you can just play innocent and act all concerned thinking youre making a point here over and over again and to top it off your sentence is broken english boy putin sounds concerned doesnt he
technology,not_removed,you gave me a random google search why is the fact this is being pinned on russia with the clintons being the first source important i can get a proxy in russia and do anything
technology,not_removed,just have to keep on digging dont you
technology,not_removed,you keep replying find me a single source not a google search where the fbi cia and or nsa said the hack was russia not this we suspect because theyve hacked the elections in other countries are we no better dont we do the same cant prove it i know my facts are more true than yours because i have in writing that her campaign started the russia thing we all are fighting each other over this stupid shit and not spending our energy on something that matters im not wrong were fucked atm because both people running for power are fucking insane trump is the devil hiliary is the devils right hand man
technology,not_removed,youre going to keep digging after i proved you wrong with sources bye
technology,not_removed,proved it wrong how you linked me to google as if its a source to humor you looked at every link on the first few pages know what i found believe no it was the russians edit we keep going clinton had money donated to her campaign without disclosure from russia funny i thought they hacked dnc
technology,not_removed,owned by your own link cybersecurity experts and us officials however said they believed russia engineered the release of the emails to influence the nov us presidential election try reading past the headline next time this is just weak and a waste of my time
technology,not_removed,believed wouldnt it be a leak if this info was true but no one is talking about the gov having done it
technology,not_removed,so now youre worried about the language used when you first claimed only hillary and her campaign were claiming this what a sad attempt at goal post moving of course they couldnt prove so they had to use language like believe since the evidence points to russia and some classified information the government cannot use go play concerned poster to someone else you didnt even read the citation you thought would shut me up
technology,not_removed,how uber does even work on manhattan every time you look down from the window of one of those scyscrapers cars on the street below are yellow
technology,not_removed,uber is cheaper than yellow cabs thats it whenever surge pricing goes into effect i use a yellow cab but normally uber is much cheaper also generally cars are cleaner and driver nicer
technology,not_removed,how uber does even work on manhattan every time you look down from the window of one of those scyscrapers cars on the street below are yellow more convenient dont have to call a crabby fucking dispatcher and negotiate a pickup location then wait when leaving a bar late at night no fucking scams credit card reader broken pay cash to leave airport because fuck you lets go in circles for driver doesnt get confused about directions because they have phone gps had one cabbie get incredibly lost between jfk and washington heights and then try to charge me for their fuckup ratings to get rid of shitty cabbies cabs that dont smell like vomit encrusted sweaty ballsack or have vomit inducing air fresheners that bludeon your nose into submission uber drivers dont fucking talk on their phone the whole time uber was often the slightly more expensive option but the benefits were well worth the extra price i take them over yellow cabs unless i am super desperate and a cab is sitting next to me idle
technology,not_removed,does work it
technology,not_removed,in poland they fight by being cheaper scamfree and by providing a better service better fleet better drivers and easier to hail i imagine its their business model everywhere if taxis suck then people wontt want to use them regardless of how many of them are there outside your window
technology,not_removed,i used exclusively lyft and uber on a recent vacation not a problem at all

technology,not_removed,beautiful
technology,not_removed,ive been saying this for a few years i can imagine a future where you buy an algorithm album that generates an infinite amount of a certain type of music
technology,not_removed,no amsp is so good let radiohead do radiohead
technology,not_removed,you manage to avoid most horror cliches at the expense of a paper thin plot that is only vaguely immersive needs more zombies and jump scares
technology,not_removed,its not just what the parents make the student do its what the schools make them do google classroom apps for school give them access to your childs grades as well
technology,not_removed,same
technology,not_removed,google should just stick with searching things
technology,not_removed,you wont buy albums you will buy access to google music and they will generate music based on music you listen too and the data they collect when you roam the web

technology,not_removed,no you dont a song is automatically copyrighted once the song is in its final form google is the copyright holder because they employed the machine to do the work for them when you are hired to do work such as make a song you dont own the rights unless your employer gives you the rights

technology,not_removed,google fiber is being strangled by monopolistic competitors not dead yet not killed by silicon valley the headphone jack isnt dead journalism was arguably already dead or zombified
technology,not_removed,rsavedyouaclick
technology,not_removed,why not the vast majority of people just use whatevers in the box with their phone and dont care about the connector
technology,not_removed,not in general but with a device as small as a smart phone there are trade offs the headphone jack is a rather large and singlepurpose connector
technology,not_removed,yeah i thought it meant innovative startups which were purchased and dissolved or sued out of business
technology,not_removed,the google fiber being strangled is such bull shit we need a competitive market and i was gonna switch to google fiber as soon as mycity got it
technology,not_removed,after my sony ericsson headset died i have yet not found any single one suitable replacement that isnt worse or significantly more expensive so keep the headphone jack please
technology,not_removed,its simple getting rid of the jack means i cant charge my phone and have it charging at the same time
technology,not_removed,battery anxiety for ear buds no thanks try again when they also are powered wireless
technology,not_removed,i fail to believe th actually you may be right but its super shitty for those who dont use whateverdo care about
technology,not_removed,it isnt large nor is it single purpose you can use it for a lot of stuff pressy was a creative attempt that fell flat because of shitty implementation however the concept was awesome
technology,not_removed,my phone is small enough they should invest in battery technology now
technology,not_removed,literally a problem
technology,not_removed,of course its super shitty but so was not being able to use floppy discs or cds or third party hard drives or replaceable batteries

technology,not_removed,i have a counter to that yes how else are people going to learn that they shouldnt willy nilly include everyone in the company on really really irrelevant emails ive only ever done it when it was something that should only have been sent to a small select group and clearly not an accident they somehow thought everyone needed to be in on their self involved little project best to nip these things in the bud
technology,not_removed,people you may know also shows you people who have searched your name on fb so when you are creep stalking that hottie they will see you show up there i personally think they are using the phones mic to listen in and serve ads based on that too cant prove it but i have seen stuff weve been talking about show up in ads when nobody searched for it or anything fb told me they were using peoples locations to serve ads though didnt think that was a secret and that is why i dont let fb on my phone the app or just through browser and i keep telling people about these things but nobody seems to care
technology,not_removed,facebook denied that location on its own would show possible friends but when combined with other data would show friend recommendations
technology,not_removed,im sure i remember reading about the mic thing
technology,not_removed,interesting article but i guess its partially the users fault too if they chose weak passwords with my phone galaxy i only have to enter the password twice after a restart after that i unlock the phone with my fingerprint this in itself is weak because a motivated attacker can get my fingerprint and trick the sensor with it if i have really important stuff id use eds which is a neat app although you have to pay for it and have a rooted phone if you want all the nice features
technology,not_removed,congrats netflix youre now approaching the google level where service interruptions make the news its just a blip you know what youre doing
technology,not_removed,i aint see shit
technology,not_removed,why does luke have to break everything
technology,not_removed,this code error code
technology,not_removed,its down completely for me right now i cant watch any shows
technology,not_removed,goddammit i just wanted to watch some deep space nine
technology,not_removed,that explains why i couldnt watch friends now ill never know if rachels nipples are pointy in this episode
technology,not_removed,netflix really needs to add some kind of download feature so people can set popular shows to buffer and then watch them without interruption later
technology,not_removed,in a selfish way im kind of glad this happened i would definitely have sat around and not moved at all for the rest of the day if it didnt
technology,not_removed,yup hit ep and it said they couldnt play it
technology,not_removed,line from the show
technology,not_removed,anyone else notice luke cage is a poor cant pay his rent yet works two jobs but has a samsung galaxy edge
technology,not_removed,luke cage is bulletproof netflixs servers arent
technology,not_removed,heres a new show guys just ddos my shit fam
technology,not_removed,haha my first colonoscopy nets me a win i watched most of it while fasting yesterday and finished off the last couple episodes after i got home this morning
technology,not_removed,good thing i binged it last night
technology,not_removed,power man causing outages
technology,not_removed,is the show that good
technology,not_removed,someone needs to get to handle this
technology,not_removed,is that why netflix has been so goddamn shitty this week just tryin to watch the office here
technology,not_removed,nice show is damn good
technology,not_removed,anyone else find it kind or corny and not that great
technology,not_removed,oh god i cant wait to see what happens to amazon when the grand tour comes out
technology,not_removed,first episode was boring af
technology,not_removed,it was a two hour outage for some regions maybe three so i cant understand why people are calling this a huge embarrassment for netflix its a server based service so non scheduled outages is just a fact of doing business maybe it was even an issue that was out of their hands why do people not have the patience of chalking this up to a slight inconvenience and move on i know its a paid service and it also interrupted my binge on elementary but seriously
technology,not_removed,with dialogue like i was inside you from luke cage they really should have expected this
technology,not_removed,i am watching it right now just fine
technology,not_removed,literally watching it right as i type this no issues
technology,not_removed,watching it right now without a hitch
technology,not_removed,i was watching house when this outage happened 😤 moment of truth and it crashed
technology,not_removed,jan michael vincent
technology,not_removed,the show is pretty good the music is a damn nice touch as well
technology,not_removed,what do i do with my pitchfork now that its back
technology,not_removed,its cuz of all the badass music loaded into every single episode
technology,not_removed,dang now all i can do is chill
technology,not_removed,i had just finished the first episode
technology,not_removed,without ruining anything whats the show about
technology,not_removed,the busted harddrive in episode was utter bullshit
technology,not_removed,how many episodes of the new show did they put on netflix also is it worth watching daredevil season if you accidently saw the last episode xd someone was watching dd season ep i was cooking so watched to see if it was good or not then saw the ending of the episode and face palmed
technology,not_removed,i thought theyd be reporting floods coming from all female subscribers homes
technology,not_removed,would it be fair to have a netflix subscription but torrent the tv show
technology,not_removed,only episodes in the biggie part bought me
technology,not_removed,while im glad marvel fans are foaming kinda wish this was the news for stranger things lol
technology,not_removed,but its too late— ive already seen everything
technology,not_removed,is there any actual proof that it is because of this one show or is this just the narrative that they are going with tv show starring black man breaks internet i mean its a pretty ordinary superhero shtick nothing to get excited about
technology,not_removed,i was watching brooklyn ninenine at work then went home to continue bingingand they removed iti am devastated
technology,not_removed,hailcorporate
technology,not_removed,great show so far
technology,not_removed,itt paranoia
technology,not_removed,brought a girl over loaded up netflix only to get an error code i think i just got cock blocked by netflix
technology,not_removed,anyone want to grab coffee
technology,not_removed,damn i watched the first episodes this morning i hope its back up and running when i am ready to watch the rest its been very good so far
technology,not_removed,netflix took two steps backward only to move forward
technology,not_removed,i experienced this as well watched the first two episodes not really impressed yet to be honest i had high hopes but it hasnt really grabbed me yet crossing my fingers on it im still gonna watch the whole thing the netflix marvel shows havent failed me yet
technology,not_removed,frontpage of reddit means this post probably just turned a really nasty outage into an incredible viewership boost
technology,not_removed,its not that great
technology,not_removed,can i say it though luke cage wasnt good can it be said it was the worst of the so far daredevil was great jessica jones was good luke cage was kind of terrible the music and the setting was great but the fights just awful that hallway scene why were guys with semi automatics firing and running at him whoever did that choreography needs to get fired i only say this because the other mcu shows in netflix set such a high bar
technology,not_removed,do i need to watch jessica jones first to enjoy luke cage
technology,not_removed,its worth it
technology,not_removed,i managed to watch all but the last one on my tv but it took forever to load the final episode and when it did load it was subpotato quality i switched to my ipad and everything was fine
technology,not_removed,this is a good sign the show is popular im really diggin it
technology,not_removed,shows kind of shit tbh
technology,not_removed,probably because netflix has had a serious lack of new content these past few months and people are itching for something new to watch
technology,not_removed,too much marvel series for my taste
technology,not_removed,correlation is not causation
technology,not_removed,sweet christmas
technology,not_removed,sorry for the marvel heroes quote but luke cage just shut you down
technology,not_removed,where are the torrents though
technology,not_removed,sweet christmas
technology,not_removed,the show could have been episodes fewer and i so wanted matt to have a cameo in this rosario is killing it in these shows
technology,not_removed,i cant do it anymore first it was oitnb then it was narcos then stranger things and the get down i need a break im still trying to watch season of game of thrones i cant keep chasing the netflix band wagon even if all of my favorite celebrities tweet its so good to each other
technology,not_removed,holy shit this is not news
technology,not_removed,googles luke cage married to jessica jones nope
technology,not_removed,fuck off with this viral marketing bullshit
technology,not_removed,im watching now just fine to be honest this luke cage show kinda sucks its waaay too cliche with the we black yall our ancestors faught so hard tupac and biggie and p diddy etc etc its fine to establish black culture narrative etc but theyre beating a dead horse so hard its turned into ground chuck making the actual story suffer my eyes roll back every time i see them swinging at that low hanging fruit fuckin lazy writing i can predict what the next scene is going to be sometimes and the villain so far im only episodes in isnt convincing at all his landlord was scarier than him when she came and asked luke for the rent i liked the villain a lot better in house of cards he was great in that and actually a lot more menacing sorry yall i just needed to rant im gonna finish watching i hope it gets better and i hope they take down that biggie painting its where is my kanye painting edit and for the record so far it is better than daredevil luke cage is a cool character
technology,not_removed,can confirm httpdowndetectorcomstatusnetflix we were watching earlier and it juststopped like altogether
technology,not_removed,its playing fine right now
technology,not_removed,had this trouble a few hours ago i can wait until tomorrow hopefully its fixed by then
technology,not_removed,works in germany
technology,not_removed,yup i got booted earlier today because of this
technology,not_removed,well good thing i finished this yesterday well thats sad
technology,not_removed,i dont know if this works for everyone but apparently the mobile client still works idk maybe its accessing different servers than the web player all i know is that we binged for like hours on my phone while all three computers in the household kept giving us error messages
technology,not_removed,no issues with netflix here ct usa but then again im watching a relatively low bandwidth stream black and white
technology,not_removed,anyone else sad the psych is gone i was on season the second time through
technology,not_removed,ive just been enjoying watching psychuntil they took it off netflix today
technology,not_removed,i deleted and reinstalled the app
technology,not_removed,i did have it down shift the video stream probably a response to the congestion but it kept truckin netflix response to this kind of traffic is to just spin up more media flinging servers in aws if aws runs out of resources youre going to see a lot of shit go down like reddit salesforce and other big cloud sites
technology,not_removed,no idea what luke cage is but those of us looking for the amanda knox doc were bummed as well
technology,not_removed,its working for me here canada
technology,not_removed,for some of us episode finished then wouldnt load at all
technology,not_removed,wait this is out guess ill go see if i can watch it
technology,not_removed,i was watching on my roku then got the service interruption i went to the roku in my other room and was able to continue watching my main roku is still having the issue
technology,not_removed,my chrome cast wasnt working with netflix earlier today
technology,not_removed,anyone for coffee
technology,not_removed,i dont know what you mean i am actually watching it right now
technology,not_removed,it wouldnt load episode four earlier today
technology,not_removed,works fine for me
technology,not_removed,ive only watched the first two so far and never had a real outage but it did freeze a couple times during both episodes
technology,not_removed,now the outage made me start smallville on hulu what have i done
technology,not_removed,fuck that i was trying to watch narcos
technology,not_removed,i was trying to watch it but no dice is this isis
technology,not_removed,soo is the show any good
technology,not_removed,chaos monkey has failed them
technology,not_removed,practicable
technology,not_removed,canada got deadpool zootopia and kill so its not all luke cage but it is for me last episode
technology,not_removed,if i didnt like jessica jones would i like this show
technology,not_removed,better than timewarner or comcast 😂😂
technology,not_removed,i noticed it went down for a little while but i was just trying to watch bobs burgers reruns is luke cage that good
technology,not_removed,i thought it was on my end
technology,not_removed,xbox had an update that broke all videos had to hard reset worked since then
technology,not_removed,did anyone else finish it before it went down i finally got a weekday off friday and just binged watched the entire thing
technology,not_removed,remindme hours
technology,not_removed,im on episode right now ive been watching since am
technology,not_removed,all these comments xd so many inside jokes
technology,not_removed,so thats what was wrong on friday i couldnt watch shit
technology,not_removed,you wanted it that line and the following reaction jesus fucking christ i literally covered my mouth
technology,not_removed,show is actually boring when they get iron fistpower man going though ill be on board
technology,not_removed,marvel shows really have a thing for car doors huh
technology,not_removed,haha the outage happened when i just started the last episode had to watch it from an alternate site how long did the outage last
technology,not_removed,when season of longmire dropped i couldnt finish season for a bit
technology,not_removed,i assumed it was the amanda knox documentary
technology,not_removed,we watched the first episodes last night its pretty solid
technology,not_removed,should i watch this show it has decent ratings but so did jessica jones and i wasnt impressed
technology,not_removed,is there anything in their systems that would prevent an offline viewing experience thats my only complaint with netflix that i cant download shows or movies to watch offline while im traveling
technology,not_removed,cough effective marketing ploy is effective didja hear about luke cage before nah now youre curious as to the fact it must be so good that it can cripple netflix for a few minutes
technology,not_removed,i just started watching netflix recently i like the lack of commercials but i was surprised at how few movies and series are available netflix used to have more choices but has reduced its number of movies i have to wade through rivers of sludge to find one or two good films and they are usually films ive seen before
technology,not_removed,worked fine for me may be a feature since i will will be back to having nothing to watch in the next two days and angry about my bender
technology,not_removed,me i will wait till the new tv season is over to watch the new shows luke cage new season releases ddjj on netflix that way the summer isnt just just network reruns for me and i get to save money for months between sports ice hockeyfootballbasketball new tv show season their is plenty to watch at nite plenty to record was watching collage football so no clue what nf did
technology,not_removed,i hated the show anyway
technology,not_removed,too much bbc
technology,not_removed,if only i could pay extra for more speed and a guaranteed connection
technology,not_removed,also keep in mind it isnt netflix doing all that work its hosted on amazons servers just like reddit is i think
technology,not_removed,well it is a saturday
technology,not_removed,i had to do some price research for work once and amazon was down i was like wtf this cant happen it would be like going to walmart and finding the doors all locked and a back in minutes sign hanging on the front they were out for a good half hour too it was quite shocking
technology,not_removed,im sure its all comcasts fault
technology,not_removed,gotta trademark that shit
technology,not_removed,did you try combing the desert
technology,not_removed,mr torgue
technology,not_removed,rip literally every door in that show
technology,not_removed,because hes complex okay
technology,not_removed,i know especially when luke runs away from the cops or after cottonmouths men like he could just break the door lock and enter calmly but no luke gotta bust the door down like the fucking kool aid man
technology,not_removed,luke is all about selfcontrol he is an excon with superhuman strength and durability his biggest regret would be losing control imagine the damage
technology,not_removed,what is luke cage about anyway
technology,not_removed,fiddle faddle
technology,not_removed,youre so corny
technology,not_removed,plot twist luke cage is santa
technology,not_removed,the same way id react if i got superpowers not what is this why am i this way im an outcast now
technology,not_removed,thats the fucking one
technology,not_removed,im glad to see im not the only one we watched two episodes and then i went back in to rewatch some parts and nothing was working
technology,not_removed,yeah have same one
technology,not_removed,we were getting but only when using our phones to cast
technology,not_removed,was the same for me a couple hours ago i popped over to prime and started sicario
technology,not_removed,same trying to watch parks and rec
technology,not_removed,yep i dont know what to do with my life
technology,not_removed,i never had issues ive been streaming from my xbox for the past couple of hours with no problems at all
technology,not_removed,well the make sense why i couldnt login
technology,not_removed,mobile seems to work flawlessly
technology,not_removed,same i was wondering if anyone else was getting netflix interruptions especially since my internet was working on everything else but netflix wasnt really working on any devices
technology,not_removed,i havent backed out of it so ive been able to watch luke cage all day
technology,not_removed,wow i had no idea what the hell was going on i was in a shitty mood and just wanted to finish my narcos two episodes left so i could start watching luke cage couldnt watch
technology,not_removed,im watching jessie just fine
technology,not_removed,i dont think they were implying that only that show was down
technology,not_removed,me too i just got to the bearded sisko eps you know shit just got good when either sisko or riker have a beard
technology,not_removed,for three strips of latinum ill make sure your doesnt lag anymore ill even throw in an hour of holo suite
technology,not_removed,currently rewatching tng for the first time since i was a kid and loving the hd remaster im pretty bummed they didnt remaster but im still going to start watching that when i reach it
technology,not_removed,ive been watching through for the last few months i watched the first seasons when it originally aired and then lost track of it when i went off to college just finished season episode last night
technology,not_removed,i was in the middle of tng when it crashed
technology,not_removed,still my favorite porstar trek series
technology,not_removed,thanks now i have to binge watch that series again i miss trek
technology,not_removed,me fuckin too man
technology,not_removed,the one where rachels oh never mind
technology,not_removed,they are source binge watched the entire show earlier this year
technology,not_removed,notsofun fact she actually wears a special bra that makes it look like her nipples are always pointy
technology,not_removed,spoiler spoiler
technology,not_removed,aye one of the best features of amazon prime is the ability to download a whole season of a show on your phone or tablet would be nice if netflix added it in some capacity
technology,not_removed,i never realized how significant this is until i lived in an area where i only had fast free internet some of the time fuck data caps
technology,not_removed,makes it too easy to illegally download them not that i had trouble getting narcos like the same night it was released on netflix edit okay man i get it i was wrong
technology,not_removed,i had trouble all the time on time warner cable for three years i had trouble all the time on att uverse for three years i have never had a single issue with wow cable in the first year ive had them i will stay with wow cable for as long as i can theyre worth every penny for clarity i had a down up connection with twc for a month a down up connection with att for for a month and a down up connection with wow cable for a month
technology,not_removed,as someone who subscribes the the big streaming services netflix hulu and amazon prime this is one of my favorite features of amazon prime video nice being able to queue up a bunch of stuff to watch on my ipad if i wont have access to a data connection i cant fathom any reason not to allow this outside of convoluted and outdated license wording between rights holders and the streaming service downloading them into an encrypted container on your device with time based server side decryption keys would seem to remove any possibility of piracy assuming sufficient keylength
technology,not_removed,thats exactly what ive been doing and its awesome first proper day off of work in weeks i wish netflix wasnt down i just wanted to zone out and watch luke
technology,not_removed,how is it so far
technology,not_removed,statement acknowledging recognition of line
technology,not_removed,free with contract click here to find out more
technology,not_removed,as someone who sometimes struggles to pay bills a phone is a lot cheaper than a months rent and you pretty much need a phone regsrdless so getting a slightly newerbetter one isnt that much more expensive and will last longer and work better than an outdated or used one
technology,not_removed,doesnt seem like hed have a problem paying his rent if his boss at the nightclub would actually pay him but more importantly he has an because samsung was willing to pay them to have him holding their new flagship
technology,not_removed,if i was living a false identity and ready to drop everything and start over any minute if i thought my identity might be compromised i would probably want a good phone that would be the only luxury you would be able to take with you if you ran
technology,not_removed,he had his own business until recently in jessica jones he might have brought the phone before he had to start over again
technology,not_removed,luke cage is bulletproof netflixs servers arent a black lady once said the same thing
technology,not_removed,had to finish the last episode elsewhere thought it was my fault at first since i edited my routers settings when i was trying to add a second router im so relieved
technology,not_removed,way to go on being responsible
technology,not_removed,werent you running back and forth to the throne while all that moviprep stuff flushed out of you thatd make shit of any comfortable netflix binge
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,i aint see shit
technology,not_removed,yes imo daredevil is the better series but im enjoying luke cage more
technology,not_removed,i havent finished it so far its okay not as exciting as daredevil or jessica jones though
technology,not_removed,its pretty solid daredevil was better but thats honestly pretty hard to beat id say its easily as good as jessica jones but with waayyyy more quotable dialogue and oneliners plus the rich history of harlem
technology,not_removed,no profanity
technology,not_removed,watch yo profamity
technology,not_removed,hes better than most of the marvel movie heroes in terms of power levels which is probably why i enjoy it hed put cap america down hard and taking on mooks doesnt leave him healing for a week like with daredevil
technology,not_removed,so many cliches its like watching power with a super hero in it
technology,not_removed,yeah except the ending
technology,not_removed,you need to use internet explorer for
technology,not_removed,you know back in the old days there would be about a week between episodes somehow we survived
technology,not_removed,daredevil season was a bore i hated all that electra ad stick garbage
technology,not_removed,would have would have been jesus christ
technology,not_removed,i would have to agree with your opinion although there seems to be a lot of set up and relationship building in luke cage in order to prep the defenders the only one we are missing is the immortal fist who will be played by the actor who was loris tyrell in got i am enjoying the show though and i would put it on par with dd as opposed to below it i dont even remember episode of lc though it was utterly useless besides the intro of knight also i am enjoying the incorporation of the marvel shared universe with the mention of hammer industries and their weapons being on the streets and their inclusion of metals not of earth
technology,not_removed,ive only made it through episodes so far feels full of halfassed acting and shitty one liners
technology,not_removed,thats disappointing because i loved the first two episodes and seemed like complete filler i wish first time seasons like this were limited to only episodes instead of straight off the bat jessica jones so far has been my least favourite of the bunch but i still have this to finish
technology,not_removed,looking at it the wrong way netflix was trying to help you out by helping you get to the point
technology,not_removed,always forward
technology,not_removed,do you remember shaft or black dynamite luke as a comic was born out of blaxsploitation the fights were meant to feel exaggerated and senseless because thats how they have always been in the genre and they did it perfectly dd and jj were born of a different era for different reasons than lc thats why comparing the three isnt fair and why lc will always seem off its just the genre the only thing id have enjoyed more in lc had they had him pull his belt off and whip someone with it admittedly im on i think so he may still do it before the finale for all i know lol edit spelling
technology,not_removed,nah i think jj was a complete slog after like episodes luke cage is behind dd and in my book it was uneven but liked almost every episode i also appreciate that the ending left so much unresolved
technology,not_removed,you need to watch jessica jones to enjoy jessica jones
technology,not_removed,not really but there are some references to what happens in jess jones
technology,not_removed,no im episodes in the luke cage im not sure if its before or after so far it has no link to jessica jones however jj is brilliant so watch them both
technology,not_removed,that blurry guy picked something up i think
technology,not_removed,one show every six months is too much
technology,not_removed,shit puts in swear can
technology,not_removed,i dont like coffee
technology,not_removed,it was fixed hours ago
technology,not_removed,maybe theyre different hers is more detectivey this was more gang warfare
technology,not_removed,no
technology,not_removed,it only lasted for like minutes
technology,not_removed,contrary to what the other person said i think this is the worst out of the
technology,not_removed,its better then jessica jones i agree with you on jj
technology,not_removed,website that is extensively used by the majority of the population and accounts for very sizable portion of internet traffic goes downyou dont think thats newsworthy
technology,not_removed,netflix has a massive distribution of regional and localized cdn caching servers they will freely distribute their openconnect cdn appliances to isps and peering data centers like for free this is done to ensure that the latest content or frequently watched content is stored more closely to the customers and to prevent that traffic from leaving the isps network and saturate peers or longhaul links there have been much more highly anticipated shows and movies released that did not kill the netflix content delivery service so im skeptical that this show was the culprit ill dig for more info to find out for sure though
technology,not_removed,that doesnt mean its amazons fault either it could still be netflixs fault for not predicting the load or allocating enough servers for themselves it could also be amazons fault if their servers didnt perform how they promised
technology,not_removed,my understanding was only the netflix front end servers were on aws the actual content is spread across cdns
technology,not_removed,the netflix website is hosted on aws their content is on cdns all over the damn place most major msos have at least one netflix cdn inside their as
technology,not_removed,you are vastly underestimating what netflix accomplishes they use chaosmonkey which randomly shuts down servers well virtual machines to be exact they do this all the time all day long yet ℅ of the time there are no interruptions this forces them to be extremely redundant and failure proof also during the course of a show youre watching the software on the servers that are feeding your video stream night have been updated several times without you even noticing their infrastructure is really really great
technology,not_removed,netflix also utilizes cache servers around the country and world connected to various isps video is stored on those and sent out to customers on a more local level
technology,not_removed,its up to netflix to define their own scalability metrics on aws so i doubt aws is to blame but like mentioned above this is just a blip netflix is compliant and kicks ass
technology,not_removed,netflix runs a combination of amazon web services for the over arching system but streaming is handled by servers on each internet providers network to decrease overhead this seemed to be an issue with some of the servers in the providers from my experience
technology,not_removed,why isnt netflix owning the base and renting the spike
technology,not_removed,one time the power went out for twenty minutes i started thinking about if i could kill a person in self defense
technology,not_removed,lets go get coffee
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,httpiimgurcomlflmbkcgif there you happy now lol
technology,not_removed,residential car metal cage or wall luke can go all kool aid man through everything
technology,not_removed,for real listen luke not everybody around here is made of money maybe just break the doorknobs and leave the doors on their hinges and did you really have to break that storefront window no you did not you wild man now someones going to have to stay up all night to keep crackheads from looting the place
technology,not_removed,big black superhero doing superhero stuff i havent finished the entire season but right now hes trying to make things right for a friend who was killed and get back at the person whose henchmen did it
technology,not_removed,its part of the avengers universe on the netflix side with daredeviljessica jones hes going to eventually join up with the others in an avengers style group called the defenders which comes out next year i think after the member has had his show they take place after the first avengers movie and the attack on new york is used as a reason for why society has gone to shit to fit the comic storylines which were written decades ago when parts of new york were much more run down and crimeridden
technology,not_removed,i bet this will make it into season two
technology,not_removed,i ponder a woman
technology,not_removed,merry christmas asshole swear jar
technology,not_removed,weird im getting it says missing component i followed the instructions please visit chromecomponents locate the widevinecdm component and click the check for update button but it still doesnt work though it works on edge for some reason
technology,not_removed,i didnt even get that before earlier in the day i couldnt even reach the netflix host i think it was error in chrome or something
technology,not_removed,god this made me laugh i dont even know why
technology,not_removed,just checked because i saw your comment seems to be back up now
technology,not_removed,hey i just typed in your problems in the search bar and it said you may be having network connectivity problems
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmaingrowingthebeard
technology,not_removed,im about three seasons ahead of you go go sacrificial targ
technology,not_removed,dont listen to this fraud i gave him three strips of latinum a month ago and my netflix is still on the fritz hire me instead ill fix it for two strips
technology,not_removed,is the hd remaster available on netflix i havent gotten around to watching tng in years
technology,not_removed,ive watched tng several times since i was a kid and i finished it on netflix a few months ago its my favourite one im currently in the last season of and wondering if i should watch voyager or enterprise next then i might just go round again with tng
technology,not_removed,my netflix subscription is mostly just for star trek and house shows these days i wonder if netflix is gonna lose trek when the cbs show comes out
technology,not_removed,i got about as far as season back in the nineties just recently ive decided to watch the whole thing over from scratch im up to season twoparter past tense slightly bizarre that this particular story is now just years in the future
technology,not_removed,wait until you get to that conclusion at the end of the season no trek series maybe no series ever has been wrapped up with such style
technology,not_removed,god bless the guy who turned up the ac every episode i bet the investors were in on it
technology,not_removed,til i feel like my whole life has been a lie now i dont know what to believe anymore
technology,not_removed,is it an ice pack bra with the nipples exposed
technology,not_removed,one lackadaisical googling later uhm source
technology,not_removed,aint oligopolies grand
technology,not_removed,i bought a hard drive and loaded it with hbo shows i watch that when my internet is shit i watch netflix when its good
technology,not_removed,not if they used some kind of encrypted storage and as you say pirated netflix stuff already shows up on your favorite illegal download sites shortly after it drops you cant keep people from pirating stuff its like trying to hold back the tide with a broom
technology,not_removed,you could still use a screen grabbing program life finds a way
technology,not_removed,spotify was able to do it
technology,not_removed,the easy way to illegally download them is to never subscribe to netflix the whole season was up in high def with perfectly sync subtitles on multiple torrent sites within hours after dawn on launch day and it could be streamed over wireless to your bedroom in case you didnt feel like getting up that day p offering the best convenience factor is always the best and perhaps only way to make your service superior to piracy for the end user never ever fall into the trap of withholding convenience in hope it might lower piracy thats shooting yourself in the foot
technology,not_removed,if youve got physical access to it you can copy it all the drm in the world wont stop someone with a dedicated video capture card or experience with reverse engineering basic encryption
technology,not_removed,hey man youre like wrong and stuff
technology,not_removed,amazon prime lets you download
technology,not_removed,amazon and bbc iplayer allow it
technology,not_removed,amazon prime does it
technology,not_removed,amazon doesnt seem to have a problem
technology,not_removed,maybe but the larger issue is that most of the content licenses they have forbid doing just that amazon had the smarts to negotiate in the practice and its actually super nice to have there really is no reason besides internal concern that they couldnt make their own shows available for download
technology,not_removed,i had a trying to watch oitnb when the new season was released pay for netflix and still got the shaft
technology,not_removed,did you just say it would make something easier and then in the same comment say that that thing was easy anyway
technology,not_removed,granted your edit but i should say that i use streaming sites as a last resort if its unavailable due to jackasses playing the ddos game but im paying for netflixs service anyway i dont care if i find it on a streaming site to play the content that said i still make sure to rate it and make note of whether the content itself was worthwhile ditto amazon prime or hulu
technology,not_removed,makes it too easy to illegally download them that kind of argument leads us to drm it currently is and always will be easy to find illegal copies of any netflix show all that inconveniencing netflix customers does is make it more likely that they will take the illegal route instead
technology,not_removed,i really liked it i managed to finish it today the sense of culture and community was cool theres a lot of action machine guns and doorswalls getting torn apart id give it an
technology,not_removed,disappointing really nowhere near daredevil writingdirectingacting not even jessica jones
technology,not_removed,worst of the marvel shows but really good at what they were aiming for a story on black harlem and how a bulletproof black man who wants to be invisible becomes a hero for hire the actors and acting is pretty on point but like all things marvel netflix wise the story is very straightforward with a lot of character building but sometimes it just hangs on a plot point for too damn long and the characters make fairly illogical decisions but nothing on the level o fear the walking dead character decision making
technology,not_removed,not op but ive finished it thought it was really good albeit the weakest of the netflix marvel shows the villain isnt as good in my opinion
technology,not_removed,inexplicably gilded comment edit obligatory expression of gratitude
technology,not_removed,for just a day this phone can be yours month contract required
technology,not_removed,a phone is a lot cheaper than a months rent especially in nyc
technology,not_removed,regular colonoscopies are definitely responsible if your are a male over with a history of colon cancer in your family
technology,not_removed,it actually took a couple hours for the prep work to start its magic and even then it was a slow start so for awhile it was a half hour of relaxing run and then back twenty minutes here another half hour and then it started to become a problem lol its funny to me that people seem interested in this
technology,not_removed,jessica joneseither season of dd
technology,not_removed,i thought jessica jones was boring as hell id go ddlcjj
technology,not_removed,watch yo profamnity
technology,not_removed,watch yo profamity
technology,not_removed,i think he could take dd but the cap i dont know about that he may have tough skin but enough force can damage his internal organs like in spoiler jessica jones so maybe a well placed uppercut with caps shield can knock him out
technology,not_removed,he wouldnt beat cap
technology,not_removed,op better
technology,not_removed,yeah and everything since the first episode has been great ive seen so far
technology,not_removed,no ones stopping you from continuing to live in the middle ages you old hag
technology,not_removed,bro was action packed it was my favorite marvel netflix show so far
technology,not_removed,you felt like was filler it was his origin story one of my favorite episodes
technology,not_removed,generally speaking the thing ive learned over the years as it comes to marvels anything is that when i dont really enjoy watching or reading something for whatever reason usually it means that im the problem in one way or another for example i dont know enough about the backgrounds of something or i oversaw a critical part of the story that clicks everything together your post out of all others in this thread was exactly what i needed to read as it pertains to luke cage thanks for the insight much appreciated
technology,not_removed,right but shaft and black dynamite didnt take itself so seriously lc does and thats the problem it tried to incorprate that into the mcu defenders universe and its very off i loved the jail escape scene though you look like a damn fool
technology,not_removed,i wonder how good the next jj season would be i think that the shows strength was mostly due to the fantastic villian played by david tennant killgrave killed it in that show and then some
technology,not_removed,sweet thanks
technology,not_removed,its after he makes mention of an event that happened in jj to pops when talking about an ex girlfriend
technology,not_removed,cool thanks for the info
technology,not_removed,i think african american is the accepted term
technology,not_removed,but i was just on netflix and saw portlandia are you in the us
technology,not_removed,me neitherque the music
technology,not_removed,i bet you cant even hop like a bunny
technology,not_removed,agreed its almost certainly not an issue of unanticipated load the amount of traffic netflix does on the regular means that itd take a truly extraordinary spike to warrant any automated remediation triggering some mistake in the autoscaling my guess is a slow boil situation some critical subsystem that chaos monkey hasnt randomly killed before that is for instance leaking a tiny amount of memory so after months it just suddenly blows up ive dealt with this before with fucking zookeeper shitting the bed and killing for instance your entire kafka network
technology,not_removed,yep we actually have a link to the device in our head end the amount of data it saves is mad crazy
technology,not_removed,so im skeptical that this show was the culprit i took it as a hint as this show must be super amazing and told my so about it and the server issue shed never heard of the showcharacter and ive only seen a few images on here but havent payed attention and didnt know it was close to coming out i started saying that we should watch it tonight and realized what she was actually about to tell me which is maybe netflix let it happen on purpose knowing it would make news and people like us would flock to watch itsome needing to subscribe to do so not saying thats what happened but i wouldnt put it past any big company to use a tactic like that
technology,not_removed,will that also work for more local content like if the post is relevant to rkansascity it will be hosted in kansas
technology,not_removed,isnt one of amazons selling points that they are elastic though and self allocate and scale based on load then again i am sure a lot of that is dependent on configuration settings that netflix is responsible for
technology,not_removed,this is definitely not amazons fault in pretty much any scenario i work for a company that uses a ton of aws and if you dont have a disaster recovery plan that covers omg amazon is gone its on you that said netflix is very very very good at what they do even anderson silva got knocked the fuck out once
technology,not_removed,the cdns are often these localized servers cohosted at your isp theyre big red boxes and each of them has a hand written quote on it source i have one
technology,not_removed,you dont even drink coffee
technology,not_removed,just realized thats tuvok from star trek voyager
technology,not_removed,fun fact the actor in that scene is steve buscemi who was a firefighter at a
technology,not_removed,i love that they have a pick instead of a comb
technology,not_removed,and if theres no door hell just decided on a place for a door to be and break it down
technology,not_removed,stops thugs from trying to get money from restaurant owners causes irreparable damage to shop
technology,not_removed,maybe he saw jessica breaking just the door knobs and decided that breaking the whole door looked much cooler
technology,not_removed,to get a cup of coffee
technology,not_removed,oh ok so is he the guy with unbreakable skin or what
technology,not_removed,thats because season two is going to be marvels power man and iron fist if the world is just that is
technology,not_removed,that was so fucking smooth
technology,not_removed,i was trying to decide of it was too corny or not got to be episode before it was too much i be back tho
technology,not_removed,i pondered you pondering a woman before you ponderized
technology,not_removed,yeah its something weird with chrome mine wont play from the browser but it will play from the app i got the exact same message last night and today
technology,not_removed,ah yes service unavailable aka we aint found shit
technology,not_removed,ya back up for me now but earlier even when it was down it was still working on my phone for some reason
technology,not_removed,very underrated comment
technology,not_removed,two strips ill do it for hour with moogie anything goes
technology,not_removed,jokes on him i paid him in gold worthless gold
technology,not_removed,i got rom to do it for free
technology,not_removed,find out why ferengi hate him
technology,not_removed,i down voted you but its just business you understand
technology,not_removed,depends where you are
technology,not_removed,im planning on watching them all in broadcast order although ill probably skip enterprise as it never really felt like star trek to me
technology,not_removed,doubtful netflix are paying for discovery in its entirety if anything happens id be less surprised if all access goes bust and discovery moves to netflix
technology,not_removed,not if they wanna keep me subscribed
technology,not_removed,theyve got a deal to stream that show outside of the usa so i doubt theyll lose the shows leading up to it
technology,not_removed,if it makes you feel any better there are plenty of pictures of the actress not on the set of friends still with pointy nipples
technology,not_removed,so no one told me life was gonna be this way
technology,not_removed,just believe in pointy nipples
technology,not_removed,thanks gonna save this for next week
technology,not_removed,it was probably for continuity purposes imagine if during a scene her nipples were hard then not then hard and yada yada especially considering how much the eyes draw to them naturally
technology,not_removed,my whole life is a liiiiieeee
technology,not_removed,thats a million dollar idea right there my friend
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,which is weird ive lived in nj texas and now florida and ive never heard of data caps until reddit shit i even work at a local isp we dont do data caps and were merging with two other bigger ispscable companies and still no data caps
technology,not_removed,to be honest i could pirate anything id ever want from netflix in minutes i pay a month for netflix for the convenience remembers where i was loads well save for this incident really good layout and i dont have to have a million tv shows on a hard drive
technology,not_removed,makes it too easy to illegally download them not if they used some kind of encrypted storage if you can view the content a pirate can rip it at best you can delay rips with obscure systems that pirates have to reverse engineer first but after the fact the process is streamlined and adds no reasonable delay only unnecessary restrictions for the legal customers
technology,not_removed,if youre willing to record while you watch it basically any screen capture software would work ffsplit for example
technology,not_removed,if you get the powdered tide its pretty easy to hold back with a broom
technology,not_removed,yes but that loses quality and possible frame rate issues and one episode at a time but yes life finds a way
technology,not_removed,doesnt amazon prime instant do it too
technology,not_removed,they understand that people are going to pirate music regardless and their quality while fine wont be the sort of high fidelity pirates can easily acquire elsewhere same thing may not be true for netflix where they have high quality streaming
technology,not_removed,exactly i was a music hoarder for years especially back in college gigs of all told bought spotify premium and havent dld a song in years
technology,not_removed,the stream encryption hasnt been cracked yet as far as i know its hdcp in the hdmi connection thats the weak point
technology,not_removed,i like it as well i love the black dynamiteesque feel to it whenever he deliver lines too
technology,not_removed,wall and doors being torn apart sign me up
technology,not_removed,same for me loved the show overall but it started to do down after the episode and the villain didnt do it for me the late episodes villain was just too all over the place
technology,not_removed,i actually prefer it to jessica jones but i seem to be in the minority theyre all damn good though though daredevil still has the better fight choreography by far
technology,not_removed,what makes me kinda prefer it to daredevil is that there are no fight scenes that go on for ages at least not until now episode at the moment this was really a killer for me there though i totally loved the show
technology,not_removed,really its worse than jessica jones i really disliked that might pass on this then
technology,not_removed,i tried watching the first episode but honestly couldnt get into it im going to try again because maybe i wasnt in the mood but it just didnt feel like the script was that good does it get better later on
technology,not_removed,really man i cant stand jessica jones shes a horrible character not the actress she was fine i love the idea behind the character but the execution was just ok the villain was amazing though i ended up watching the whole thing because of kilgrave and luke
technology,not_removed,i aint gild shit
technology,not_removed,some research suggests other methods may be better also who knew in colonoscopies is fatal holy shit look into it it may not be necessary
technology,not_removed,i just went through it last monday so thats why i was asking same experience it was a slow start but then then the gates of the underworld opened a gurgling bubbly brown effluent mess i can drink or pints of guinness in a single sitting but two litres of that moviprep stuff was obnoxiously difficult never again
technology,not_removed,same but im not done with lc yet frankly i dont see why everyone loved jj so much it was super slow and boring i mean i get that superheros have a lot of moral dilemmas and human responses to superhuman events and emotional turmoil and whatever but would it kill you to just put a fight scene or in the superhero show i guess the fight between luke and jessica was pretty good but i dont know it didnt really seem like a superhero show more like a lifetime drama with minor superpowers
technology,not_removed,i have to agree but only for one reason luke went soft after prison he used to be able to fight well but since hes had to hold himself back for so long to not kill anyone and because nobody and no things have posed much threat to him hes gotten too used to swatting people like flies rather than using any of the finesse he used to have being a straightforward brawler just wouldnt work against an incredibly well trained fighter like cap even if it would take cap hours to wear luke down give luke cage a couple weeks knowing hell have to fight a super human and he takes it
technology,not_removed,i mean hes no saitama
technology,not_removed,so far what ive seen they do a good job of keeping him out of the superman zone as soon as a character becomes invincible we stop identifying with them
technology,not_removed,looking forward to it
technology,not_removed,that was very rude i think you should apologise to umrcydonia
technology,not_removed,should have should have been jesus christ
technology,not_removed,admittedly those parts were awesome well the second half where he becomes luke cage and dons the classic costume that was a real nice touch episode was very fillery too i wanna see who this diamondback is and what he looks like the soundtrack is pretty sweet but why dont these shows use f bombs they show plenty of brutal violence nudity but they cant say fuck a couple of times i feel like cottonmouth and his goons would use that type of vocabulary the most
technology,not_removed,you could compare him to captain america in the fact caps comic was born during the good ole days which is why hes basically a frickin boy scout for so long its just the genre he was created infor over the course of several movies though you can clearly see the mcu cap transition into a more modern version of the character i suspect they may do something similar with lc but id honestly be a little sad because the ridiculousness in lc is part of what makes lc who he is and the show as great as it is
technology,not_removed,honestly out of the shows killgrave is my least favorite villain compared to cottonmouth and kingpin hes just so corny and unbelievable and im not talking about his powers
technology,not_removed,why dont you start with jessica jones its pretty good too
technology,not_removed,thanks i mustve missed that just got done with episode i will probably binge watch the rest tomorrow
technology,not_removed,that blurry guy picked african american up i think
technology,not_removed,in the us they just added season
technology,not_removed,it usually ends up getting sorted out and then revealed that it all came crashing down due to a line of bad code in a script that gets scaled out without proper testing and cm procedures in place to revert rapidly it has happened to me but honestly were all just speculating at this point
technology,not_removed,as someone who works on highreliability systems its not infrequent that the actual error recovery proficiency is the problem you have name servers that automatically balance load something goes wrong and they start dying off one by one because of a configuration error everything is fine as you roll stuff out until the last one gets the configuration and suddenly youre offline everywhere in the world
technology,not_removed,blessed offtopic edit i emailed steam to see if we could offer up our cage and rackspace at but no response it only accounted for of our yearly traffic so it wasnt really a critical request i mean they dont have a node in our region so the location makes sense it was still mostly for selfish reasons that i proposed it
technology,not_removed,i saw one in a cage adjascent to a cage i was racking some gear in and i saw qsfp connections coming out of it and into a pair of nexus switches with connections
technology,not_removed,it gives you tools to add elasticity for your applications theres also many components in that elasticity theres transcoders storage distribution and other type of servers that are separated and have different levels of elasticity theres also how fast the system can scale and trying to grow faster than that would result in outages this happens on reddit which have scalable servers that in theory would be able to handle tons tons of growth but then obama comes and breaks reddit
technology,not_removed,as a software engineer who works in the cloud its not as much of an out of the box solution as they make it sound there is a hell of a lot of configuration and maintenance that goes into scaling updown
technology,not_removed,elastic though and self allocate and scale based on load no this requires a significant amount of effort and engineering resources especially at netflixs scale
technology,not_removed,true for elastic beanstalk but it does it in unreliable ways also true of opsworks but its based on your configuration also your own config and triggers of what and when to scale can cause issues as well build time for new instances how frequently you check status to see which instances are overloaded bad even with their newest offerings and instance sizes its never perfect source managed aws hosting for a very spikey traffic web app
technology,not_removed,i am sure a lot of that is dependent on configuration settings that netflix is responsible for amazon just rents virtualized servers and provides the tools to scale httpsawsamazoncomautoscaling and and such how netflix uses those tools is up to it granted there are some thing in aws that are wonky like elastic load balancing that has a bit too much latency between a unexpected traffic spike and its scale up so they recommend anyway think of httpsawsamazoncom like a toolbox of virtualized hardware and managed services how those tools get used is up to the engineer behind them netflix is profoundly good at this shit and theyre probably already working on things or already shipped those things to make sure it doesnt happen again
technology,not_removed,you still have to pay for it if netflix didnt pay for enough for the demand it dont matter how elastic amazon servers are they can be elastic but you got to pay
technology,not_removed,they also may not use awss elastic services they could have their own boxes spun up so that they have more control over the configurations of their servers dbs caches etc problem with that though is that aws instances could be sharing hardware with other more taxing instances or the hardware could just failed right out from under you its not unlikely especially as you scale and your system has to be able to handle those failures
technology,not_removed,what do you mean exactly are you saying that companies should have backup hosts they can immediately switch to if their main host goes down data migration is not instant
technology,not_removed,as an it guy i agree youre generally correct but netflix is at a different scale than any other service out there theyre so massive and so big its possible it even stresses amazons services
technology,not_removed,i think wed all love a picture of such a box and some info on the amount of storage in there amount of drives kind of drives and total data capacity used d super curious now
technology,not_removed,this is what i imagine it says dont you fucking unplug me you little piece of shit i have over confirmed bgp peers
technology,not_removed,neither do you
technology,not_removed,and star trek generations and a mirror episode from and the die hard episode of tng illgobackandhidenow
technology,not_removed,walls are just doors that luke hasnt opened yet
technology,not_removed,windows arent generally irreparable
technology,not_removed,he dont drink no coffee
technology,not_removed,yeah he was also in a lot of jessica jones beforehand as well
technology,not_removed,theyre making an entirely separate show for iron fist afaik
technology,not_removed,as much as i cant stand this current incarnation of power man and iron fist id love to see them team up or even some form of heroes for hire
technology,not_removed,i would be so incredibly happy if they did a heroes for hire miniseries at the very least iron fist and cage should be supporting characters in each others shows i cant think of a better bromance in comics its what ive been looking forward to the most since they announced the netflix series well aside from danny rand bearhugging a goddamn dragon to death
technology,not_removed,i feel like they have a specific person that screens all the lines in the show and makes edits so that cage the mob boss and the politician have some of the smoothest dialogue ive ever heard the quotable smoothness of some of the lines baffles me
technology,not_removed,must have different servers for mobile streams
technology,not_removed,iirc they have servers distributed all over at isps so just because one area is down doesnt mean its a widespread phenomenon
technology,not_removed,leeta rom wants to ask you something what is it rom iii
technology,not_removed,they almost lost me when doctor who left if star trek goes i doubt i am going to stay
technology,not_removed,the bras a joke you bloke her nipples are mia
technology,not_removed,i pay a month because someone has to or there would be no netflix original programming
technology,not_removed,i actually deleted some things i had because of it being on netflixamazon mainly shit i downloaded while stationed in korea but still
technology,not_removed,id just finished season of spartacus this morning and was really looking forward to season i tried to get on netflix a few hours ago and it wasnt working i googled season spartacus and clicked on the first link and was able to watch the entire first episode yeah i pay for netflix but if presented with no easy alternative we will find a way
technology,not_removed,i had a netflix subscription for three years for that very reason but now im like homeless poor and figured the pirates life was the life for me
technology,not_removed,convenience is the best strategy to fight piracy it is part of the reason valve does massive sales
technology,not_removed,i still pay for netflix but i also download everything i want to watch in my opinion plex is honestly way more convenient that netflix has ever been personally its for several reasons no buffering i download the show and then can watch it even if my internet goes down no changing resolution mid stream i like having access to the content no matter what happens to netflixs servers like what happened today i still pay for netflix since thats how they get the money to make the great programming they have its also convenient for when i want to watch something the moment it comes out and i dont want to wait for it to show up elsewhere
technology,not_removed,is it really that easy to rip netflix
technology,not_removed,telesync telecine cams no re needed if it can be seen it can be recorded
technology,not_removed,im just saying that a properly encrypted local store wouldnt make it any easier to pirate netflix
technology,not_removed,adds no reasonable delay to pirates only unnecessary restrictions for the legal customers thats pretty much the definition of drm
technology,not_removed,yep sometimes i download stuff just because ill need offline access if netflix et al could provide that it would cut my pirating down to near zero
technology,not_removed,there are some good screen capture programs that have custom encoding options debut comes to mind
technology,not_removed,yep at least for the mobile version i heard that the reason netflix doesnt do it is on account of some of their licensing agreements being for streaming only but theres no good reason they couldnt have the option available for their original content
technology,not_removed,you can actually set the download quality on spotify
technology,not_removed,very much so i kinda felt in the first couple episodes that it seemed like some of the writing and acting was kinda hackneyed almost like this whole thing was a blacksploitation plot but then i decided they were probably going for that and let them roll with it and im getting more and more sucked in then i started doing some reading on luke cage comics he was apparently inspired by blacksploitation films so its most definitely intentional iron fist was also inspired by kung fu movies of the time so im hoping they similarly get a feel of kung fu movies in that series
technology,not_removed,yeah it was around episode it started losing me theres just this odd tone change and then it never finds a good beat again
technology,not_removed,i love the extended uncut fight scenes myself it takes a lot of effort to get those correct and interesting although daredevil is the perfect character to show that kinda thing for to demonstrate to the viewer that he is still human luke and jessica would absolutely destroy most people so their fight scenes have to be drastically different
technology,not_removed,yes but this is coming from someone who enjoyed jessica jones this show maybe more your flavor i have a thing for very strong villains that are also relatable and i felt kilgrave was just that which had me glued to my seat from the time he was introduced until the finale i still enjoyed luke cage though
technology,not_removed,no way imo luke cage is the best of the shows only daredevil compares i hated jessica jones only kilgrave made it enjoyable luke cottonmouth mariah misty all the characters in this show are fantastic if you liked daredevil you will love luke cage imo
technology,not_removed,yes it does take episodes to pick up sadly
technology,not_removed,be warned episode is even slower and less exciting than episode is but by the end of id say its pretty much got up to pace
technology,not_removed,line about no profanity
technology,not_removed,points to the swear jar
technology,not_removed,i had a different prep which was apparently a newer process judging by the nurses reactions when we were going over the prep i had to take four dulcolax tablets total and drink oz of miralax mixed with sixtyfour ounces of gatorade all over a six hour period
technology,not_removed,more like a lifetime drama with minor superpowers thats because it was a drama with superpowers jj in comics was rarely ever about her powers or being a superhero tbh i feel that they nailed her in the show hell httpsenwikipediaorgwikijessicajones theres not too much superheroing in there and whatever there is the mcu cant really emulate it given their future plans
technology,not_removed,i might im also behind on dd having only watched season so many shows so little time
technology,not_removed,it has happened to me it happens to all of us the only thing that makes me feel better is the privilege i feel when i beat down a party provider for making the same mistake i made a quarter ago shit rolls downhill its kind of like a traffic jam if we could all behave properly no one would suffer but fuck that shit you cost me a major contract you shitty party provider
technology,not_removed,eh i think it was in the neighborhood of here were a small over builder in a college town lots of cord cutters and we dont push the tv issue cable companies dont make much on video
technology,not_removed,thanks obama
technology,not_removed,totally i work with a large media companys web ops dept and a large portion of my time is spent writing code that manages amazons cloud they basically give you a bunch of little building blocks and its up to you to piece them together in ways that make sense for your organization im not knocking it though its hard to imagine a onesizefitsall cloud solution
technology,not_removed,you ever write about those experiences especially any lessons you picked up the hard way id love to read about it as would many others
technology,not_removed,honestly i call bullshit duplicating live infrastructure as a backup literally is not possible and noone is doing that he probably means zone availability
technology,not_removed,oh no i dont mean to argue for a specific mitigation strategy im just saying that its folly to blame a companys third party infrastructure or service providers when something goes wrong ultimately where does the buck stop ive been victim to service provider failures including at the worst fucking level from the the biggest provider dns from neustar fuckers and as much as id like to blame them for how much their fuckups cost my company i know that ultimately i chose them and chose a risky strategy the depended on their absolute availability and consistency for me at least the buck stops here
technology,not_removed,theyre so massive and so big its possible it even stresses amazons services perhaps but the massive scale defense against individual users traffic spikes idea applies to aws just as it applies to netflix you could argue that netflixs increasingly complete reliance on aws is evidence that aws will generally do it better at scale than netflix by netflixs own admission consider how many companies use aws if you combine them all how does that combined size compare to netflix alones size
technology,not_removed,ive never seen inside ours since it comes as a sealed unit and i would imagine they monitor chassis intrusion alarms but based on presentation the big ones like i have which are have of raw space on spinning disks and on ssd
technology,not_removed,deep
technology,not_removed,oh good chuck norris is back
technology,not_removed,neither does she ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
technology,not_removed,i dont either
technology,not_removed,i think he is implying that they each get their own season then team up in a combined season thats what i hope anyway establish each one and their own world then combine the badassicity
technology,not_removed,yeah but heroes for hire is hopefully next
technology,not_removed,cottonmouth is such an awesome villain
technology,not_removed,you cant fire me i quit before i walked in
technology,not_removed,pimp stormtrooper my sides
technology,not_removed,thats what i thought because it wouldnt stream from my computer laptop or xbox but i pulled out my ipad and it worked without any issue i kept trying because i prefer not to watch shows on a small screen but i made due it was weird
technology,not_removed,it was down for me on mobile as well
technology,not_removed,its like you never see the second base
technology,not_removed,plex is awesome that it can consolidate home media similar to netflix
technology,not_removed,yea i vote with my wallet they give me a worthwhile service so i pay for it
technology,not_removed,the above post deserves gold but currently i can only vote with my upvotes hopefully someone will finance gnovaa original programming
technology,not_removed,be careful with thattheir catalogues are continuously rotating titles in and and out
technology,not_removed,i just started spartacus yesterday this crash completely cut into my bingeathon
technology,not_removed,dont blame you still pirate things that arent on netflix
technology,not_removed,friends and family will often share netflix login credentials in my experience
technology,not_removed,better far to live and die under the brave black flag i fly
technology,not_removed,pirates life was the life for me yo ho yo ho
technology,not_removed,supposedly all it takes is a computer recording software and an hdmi splitter that strips out the encryption all stuff thats easily available certain cheaper brands of chinese hdmi splitters strip the encryption because its easier to do that than deal with all of the drm nonsense
technology,not_removed,no i just know how to torrent things like everyone else on the internet and i have a decent download speed
technology,not_removed,look up a program called play on it will record online shows and save the to your hard drive they consider them selvs a pvr type solution it works with netflix hulu and most stations sites if you are looking to record from sites you pay for it is a great option you can nor ally get a life time license for like to on sale
technology,not_removed,exactly this is why i pay for spotify for music i have a couple hundred gigs worth of music from back when i had to use my ipod classics i even bought an extra ipod classic when it was announced they were discontinued just so i knew i could have access to my music anytime then i finally downloaded and bought spotify and i havent touched my classic or dld a song in almost years
technology,not_removed,you can but it only goes so high
technology,not_removed,yeah kilgrave was good its just that jessica herself was awful
technology,not_removed,this is the comment i needed to see to put in the time to watch it ive been on the fence until now does the writing at least wrap up into a satisfying season finish
technology,not_removed,what did you think of dd trying to gauge it based on your opinions i got through the first half of daredevil pretty quickly but lost steam and finished it about a week later jessica jones took only a couple days daredevil season never grabbed me but i kept trying to the point i got to episode seven before realizing it wasnt worth it
technology,not_removed,pun about relevant plot element from the show
technology,not_removed,wikipedia says have perforations to are fatal
technology,not_removed,the binge is real my friend
technology,not_removed,httpiimgurcomdrdrtmlpng
technology,not_removed,well theres good bits and bad bits
technology,not_removed,thanks dad
technology,not_removed,no i really havent outside of work conversations that app was fun to manage ops for it was a health app for kids through a research non profit wed get large amounts of data from the kids at recess and after school and constantly have to change our time based instances based on where the large batch of kids were in the country we couldnt autoscale because the demand would outpace our instances and how fast we could build new servers
technology,not_removed,actually netflix is redundant across aws regions which is pretty baller and difficult to do which makes the upcoming postmortem even more interesting
technology,not_removed,not dr replicating for fault tolerance is called high availability
technology,not_removed,duplicating live infrastructure as a backup literally is not possible and noone is doing that you are wrong twice
technology,not_removed,eds the guys who process all the credit card transactions on the east coast get their machine room electric power from two different power stations owned by two different power companies that is the redundancy you buy when youre clearing hundreds of thousands of dollars per minute in profit
technology,not_removed,i want more jessica jones
technology,not_removed,my name is not cottonmouth
technology,not_removed,the actor who plays him also does great on house of cards
technology,not_removed,can you dig it
technology,not_removed,i literally pay and pirate their stuff too i think i have a problem
technology,not_removed,yeah i know if i want it bad enough ill just go get it again
technology,not_removed,i can see why people are against pirating but i mean honestly how else do you watch some shows theyre not on any legitimate streaming sites but theyre all over illegal perhaps illegal is strong but illegitimate sites and i cant exactly argue with their cost and convenience factor
technology,not_removed,pirating ruins the economy you disgusting piece of trashs edit dang downvoted even with the s i took the risk i suppose
technology,not_removed,its actually meant for this the different pricing tiers will allow multiple simultaneous streams and they dont even have to be in the same ip
technology,not_removed,than play a sanctimonious part with a pirate head and a pirate heart
technology,not_removed,its not the encryption thats stripped out its the hdcp handshake that is stripped out at the hdmi splitter allowing you to use nonhdcp compliant equipment
technology,not_removed,some streams may be encoded in the video with user data so you might want to check before you start sharing it not sure if thats the case but its fairly trivial
technology,not_removed,i have playon its pretty good but you really need a good computer for it to record at a decent frame rate which i have and even still if im doing anything else on the computer while its recording the recorded videos have lots of dropped frames so you basically need a good dedicated computer to use it to record full frame rate in hd oh and in my experience the compression is pretty bad so you end up with mb files for minute shows with decent not great quality i think the encoder settings can be adjusted but its definitely not very efficient im guessing its using a codec that prefers encoding speed over small file size in order to minimize the dropped frames issue i mentioned above
technology,not_removed,if i remember correctly which is a far cry from flac or any other lossless format but to the untrained ear on any standard sound system car computer speakers etc wont sound much different at all than lossless i barely hear the difference
technology,not_removed,satisfying that ones kinda hard to say id have to go with this it looks like season will be really good i was a little upset by the ending of this season to be honest although you cant have everything wrap up too nice and neat
technology,not_removed,just a warning but i preferred the early episodes as soon as the plot takes off i lost quite a lot of interest in the characters it goes from then drifts off a bit again the pacing isnt doing it for me at all
technology,not_removed,id say yes a good season finish knowing that the characters will be back but it wouldnt be a good series finale if it suddenly got canceled
technology,not_removed,i loved daredevil i thought it was pretty incredible i feel like jon bernthal turned in an amazing performance as punisher that kept me from being able to stop sad that you didnt make it to episode that was definitely the best one for me
technology,not_removed,that joke bytes
technology,not_removed,thanks bender
technology,not_removed,maybe think about it then doing this kind of architecture is just starting to become commonly accepted at my customers and lots of folks are prowling for good lessons learned stories about how to do it
technology,not_removed,they also use their proprietary open connect to avoid as much backbone traffic as possible
technology,not_removed,yea we still have some legacy stuff on local servers most is on aws now and we have redundant fiber lines with two different isps we also have giant diesel generators out back for power outages shit still happens though last month a truck hit a pole knocking out our main isp and we failed over then our failover isp had an outage as well lucky it was a weekend and only some older services were affected still not good
technology,not_removed,black and hot
technology,not_removed,jessica jones season is next up after defenders the next three shows will be iron fist season the defenders season jessica jones season theres been some rumors they might ramp it up in and do three shows in which case punisher season will likely come out between defenders and jessica jones
technology,not_removed,i didnt ask for it
technology,not_removed,im sorry mr strokes
technology,not_removed,such a perfect cast he looks very snakelike
technology,not_removed,the warriors was such a great movie and a very fitting reference
technology,not_removed,no you just want to watch your favorite shows even if netflix ever drops them
technology,not_removed,i pirate for the plane necessary
technology,not_removed,i pirated all of star trek tng to watch when i go to bed at night and halfway into season i remembered they were all on netflix oh well
technology,not_removed,same ive had a usenet account of some kind since high school years now its not for the things i can legitimately get its for the slew of older things that go away over time because of silly contracts and licensing
technology,not_removed,nah i do that too for a lot of stuff licensing and contracts for programming are temporary and change frequently especially for older stuff i once even had a show vanish overnight while i was in the middle of it and not get picked up by literally anyone else so i had to pirate it to finish it as it was never released on home video
technology,not_removed,this is my answer to people who grief me about buying kindle books in the rare cases that theres a book i want to read years from now im sure ill still be able to find it
technology,not_removed,sometimes you just want to pay for something but the companies make it really hard for you pirating is just a few clicks difficult and costs shit or easy and free sometimes it isnt that hard to figure out why people pirate
technology,not_removed,my girlfriend has netflix hulu and amazon prime still has to pirate like a third of her shows if she wants to watch them at all
technology,not_removed,i am trying to get the last season of twd on german on a legal way for month
technology,not_removed,i pay for netflix i pay for paytv in australia as well but if i cant watch something the same time as the us does on one of those things that i pay for then im going to pirate it that being said when it does appear on australian tv i will watch it then as well which i know doesnt do much in the long run but makes me feel a little better
technology,not_removed,people argue you just dont get to watch it and you have to be ok with that but thats stupid to me when i can watch it with minimal effort and essentially no consequence if companies arent going to give me a convenient way for me to pay them to watch what i want ill find another way
technology,not_removed,take my upvote brother dont be sad
technology,not_removed,have a sympathy upvote i knew what you were trying to do
technology,not_removed,i think it originally wasnt meant to be used that way but netflix adapted their service to patterns of customer behavior instead of trying to force people to use it in a certain way that business philosophy is probably why theyve stuck around
technology,not_removed,i believe that the multiple users on one account are suppose to be in the same household according to the terms of service i am pretty sure netflix could crack down on the sharing of accounts to some extent but they dont appear to be interested in doing that right now personally i share with friends and family my streaming music service netflix amazon prime economist subscription hbo ny times and probably a couple more im forgetting about
technology,not_removed,yeah definitely a possibility never did it myself for bucks a month its just not worth the effort it would be nice if they had an offline mode
technology,not_removed,if i remember correctly which is a far cry from flac or any other lossless format i wouldnt call it a far cry its pretty damned close on highend equipment the majority of audiophiles cant reliably identify vs flac in a controlled blind ab test some can and it sounds like youre one of those im not but like you said they report that its barely noticeable not disputing your argument completely just the far cry part i think is pretty damned good for most music listeners even with highend equipment
technology,not_removed,watching it was like casablanca to me the whole time i was like whoa this is a masterpiece but god damn i need to change the channel really well shot i can think of one part with the punisher in a chair that just looked beautiful ill need to try again at some point
technology,not_removed,yeah it mega bytes
technology,not_removed,where i am the rule of thumb is usually at least five clusters to serve from so you can bring one down on purpose for maintenance and have a second fail by accident and still have more than half your servers running and of course you have to pick five clusters none of which get scheduled maintenance at the same time in five different cities it can be somewhat a pita setting things up for the first time
technology,not_removed,i really hope they give it the daredevil season treatment and tighten up the pacing also give it some smarter and more interesting characters than season had
technology,not_removed,aint there a punisher season somewhere in there
technology,not_removed,i need more bernthal punisher he is the best character in the netflix mcu
technology,not_removed,httpiimgurcombglqltzgif
technology,not_removed,say sorry to the ground
technology,not_removed,i know i was disappointed he wasnt the primary villain cottonmouths character had so much depth you felt bad for him for his upbringing
technology,not_removed,it pissed me off when i was half way through scrubs and then they dropped it from the uk catalogue had to resort to a vpn to watch the us catalogue and finish the series
technology,not_removed,i bought the entirety of the first season of a show on google play and then pirated it all anyway because google play couldnt release the episodes until two days after they aired the legality of this is questionable but i had no moral qualms about doing it
technology,not_removed,gotta get that rupauls drag race allstars
technology,not_removed,hi its me your friend
technology,not_removed,it would be pretty hard as people can stream at home work on the bus at a hotel all in the same household
technology,not_removed,where i am the rule of thumb is usually at least five clusters to serve from i hadnt considered that its annoying when you hear an idea that makes so much sense that after youve heard it is so obvious and simple that it should have been noted long ago if i have instances in a cluster i can update the configuration of the whole cluster over the time it takes to update one server serially you could solve the problem of having different versions in the cluster by having them all switch over after the or nth instance finishes with all kinds of elaborate redundancies to make sure finish with this route you can still adhere to the idea that capacity should be enough to handle all of your predictable load i guess ultimately at scale my company has already achieved this doesnt help much but for the next startup its still a valuable observation
technology,not_removed,i hated that dd season was really long preview for things to come like heres the hand clan theyre doing a lot crazy stuff but i guess youre going to have to wait until the next season to find out what that big hole in the ground is for
technology,not_removed,yeah that midseason turn of events was surprising to say the least i kind of got the impression that he was on his way out when we started seeing his childhood but damn also i liked that he wasnt the big bad and i thought that episode conveyed very well why he never could be and why hed made one bad call after another leading up to that moment he was a pianist playing gangster
technology,not_removed,my opinion doesnt matter on this but i feel that if youve purchased media or access to it that you should be able to watch it as you please look at roms and emulators for game systems seems to be all gravy morally if youve purchased the physical versions
technology,not_removed,ive pirated games and bought them after because i liked them or the other way around i have no issue emulating mario kart on my phone i bought that fucking game
technology,not_removed,its not just that though i pay for all three of the above streaming options and if i can i use them but for example i wanted to watch the series london spy from the bbc last year as it aired in the uk however while bbcs website would allow you to watch online for free if you were in the uk you couldnt access it from the us bbc america wasnt due to get the show at the time for over a year which is common and happens a lot with lesser known bbc shows so i used a service similar to hola to effectively spoof a uk address to watch on the bbc if hulu aired it or if bbc america aired it concurrently with the uk release id have watched it there i dont mind paying to have a streaming service but i sort of expect my streaming services to offer what i want to watch
technology,not_removed,more like american horror story and scream among several others she watches them again anyways in high quality with subtitles when they come out on those services months later but she doesnt want to go on the internet and see all the spoilers so she watches them like next day when theyre on the pirate sites

technology,not_removed,update no lawsuit
technology,not_removed,i work at a electronic repair shop people come in a lot and say the apple store wanted to charge me x ridiculous amount for this repair and we do it for a fraction of the cost with a warranty i read that apple is against places like this or whatever but people always say the apple store sent them to us maybe i just live in a decent area with people that work together cell phone places send people to us and we send people to them same with apple and gamestop if we cant fix it for less than buying a new or used one then we dont dick them over and we send them to the places that send people our way thats the way it should be everyone working together edit thanks for the gold whoever you are also im enjoying the different perspectives ive been getting in replies edit typo edit courtesy of uyoureditsucks edit thanks for the gold whoever you are literally no one comes back to look to see if the person they gilded edited their post its just annoying to the rest of us this guy
technology,not_removed,in this case the company is likely upset that not only does louis publicly condemn its policies to a growing subscriber base but shares how to repair its hardware without going through apple support theyre probably going after him for the schematics he buys which might be illegal to obtain and showing them on his videos
technology,not_removed,update hes not actually being sued
technology,not_removed,this has not been confirmed
technology,not_removed,is there any proof that he is being sued by apple ifixit and other makers of apple repair videos and tear downs havent been sued
technology,not_removed,apple is suing wheres the link to the court filing for the lawsuit
technology,not_removed,update
technology,not_removed,the video says he is not getting sued update video is on the way you can put away your torches for now
technology,not_removed,lucky weve got all his videos from youtube in the torrents now
technology,not_removed,no they are not fucking hell reddit is full of crap sometimes
technology,not_removed,ughh op you suck hes not being sued
technology,not_removed,from the article taking all this into consideration its clear that louis has been threatened by apple but the only time the article says about a lawsuit is in the title and at the end saying supposed lawsuit the writer should just write could be sued by apple in the title but thats not clickable enough
technology,not_removed,a law firm has contacted him and wants to talk about putting schematics in his videos no legal action has been taken so far at all internet drama galore
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,he is not getting sued
technology,not_removed,remember that in the uk you have years from the date of purchase to have an item returned for repair should it become faulty according to eu law you have years im in the uk so i had a year old imac with a failed screen so i contacted apple and they said to get lost so i issue a county court summons via httpswwwmoneyclaimgovuk weeks before the court date they rang me and collected the imac for repair but it was too old so they sent me a brand new imac 😀 easy edit i was wrong and thanks to folks here for putting me right the years is not an eu rule its a uk rule
technology,not_removed,before you skewer my on a pitchfork let me say that im in favor of small independent repair shops all that being said i watched one of rossmans videos where he clearly says he downloads apple schematics from sketchy russian ftp sites because they are probably illegal and then he proceeds to use these schematics to perform professional repairs i mean if you run your business on illegally obtained intellectual property youre gonna get sued rightly or wrongly
technology,not_removed,apple is not suing him they like him
technology,not_removed,he just posted this link three is no lawsuit
technology,not_removed,he just posted a video saying hes not being sued apples lawyers expressed dissatisfaction with things hes said on the channel but they like the channel
technology,not_removed,update
technology,not_removed,so far i see no proof of anything at all happening least of all a lawsuit from apple more fear mongering
technology,not_removed,so i happen to work for best buy at one point we used to able to do repairs on apple products with geek squad you come in get a quote and we can work on your hardware we recently made a larger partnership with apple and in doing so best buy adopted applecare so now the same applecare that is offered in the apple store is also offered at any best buy as we are no longer able to offer geek squad services in them but now i have to tell my customers thanks for buying applecare now if you have a problem you can take your item to the apple store as we are no longer allowed to work on apple products anymore it just sucks that this is where the market is shifting and now long time best buy customers who shopped apple products with us can no longer get the support on their products with us
technology,not_removed,update
technology,not_removed,regardless of whether he is right or wrong am i the only person on reddit who thinks this guy is an obnoxious dickhead
technology,not_removed,click bait no lawsuit has been filed
technology,not_removed,its interesting how my experience with apple products can be ° from some of the peoples experiences in here ive been building and using computers since the timex sinclair of all the machines ive ever used or owned my apple products have been the most reliable most enjoyable to use and easiest to maintain not in anyway saying that people dont have the problems they do or received the treatment they claim they received but ive not once experienced any of it i repair machines and networks for a living im against companies taking that away from me but ive not had any problems repairing apple products in a way i wish i did have the problems people have so i can better understand their frustrations but to date i havent and cant
technology,not_removed,he made an update today he may not be getting sued
technology,not_removed,where is the evidence this is nothing but rumors at this point it feels like apple is suing but we still dont know for certain dont make this to have people pick up their pitchforks
technology,not_removed,this is a horrible article it takes speculation and treats them as fact
technology,not_removed,this dude is all drama
technology,not_removed,no he isnt
technology,not_removed,your title is not based in fact nice clickbait
technology,not_removed,not suing someone suing on reddit
technology,not_removed,absolutely disgusting sent from my iphone
technology,not_removed,hey wasnt that guy on linustechtips linus goes to him to find out how to actually fix dead gpus i think
technology,not_removed,ive watched his videos beforehe definitely knows his stuff but he is incredibly arrogant and obnoxious im torn here
technology,not_removed,this is the exact same typs of bs that the ag industry is trying to do to farmers who buy new equipment like tractors and stuff making it illegal to work on something that you own
technology,not_removed,in the video description he says im not getting sued update video on the way no idea what im getting actually and the suspense sucks so
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,he clarified that he is not getting sued but that he was being vague because he didnt know what was going to happen so it couldve been interpreted that way
technology,not_removed,just to be clear we are not certain he is actually being sued this blog has taken his video and made this assumption edit the vlogger has come out and said i am not being sued
technology,not_removed,title should be changed no one ever confirmed apple was suing him neither is he even being sued in fact according to the videos description apple likes his videos
technology,not_removed,i would like to point out and this is pure conjecture on my part that this video has been made private i think this may be the one related to the schematics
technology,not_removed,without any details im not reaching for my pitchfork terrible title and a misleading attempt to manufacture controversy for shame op
technology,not_removed,companies refuse warranty service based on this kind of thing every day all over the country in all kinds of industries
technology,not_removed,actually no they are not you people are fucking idiots lol
technology,not_removed,hes not getting sued just a drama queen
technology,not_removed,lmao this will be a thread everyone sweeps under the rug so much overreaction to completely inaccurate media reports everyone is so quick to join the antiapple circle jerk with little to no factual information but hey this is normal on reddit particularly rtechnology
technology,not_removed,this is problematic journalism if you want to call it that i wont do a systematic takedown but lets just look at a few key points the headline free speech under attack youtuber and repair specialist louis rossmann alludes to apple lawsuit first free speech isnt under attack the government isnt putting this guy in jail no one is stopping him from disseminating his videos on his own site as far as i can tell they havent even been taken off youtube but even if they are thats still not a free speech issue you have no rights to speech on a private companys systems but ok lets pretend he is getting flack how to you get from alludes that it is apple to this certainty apple isnt happy about it yay let me try apple doesnt give a shit this guy exists hes no threat to them and they have no idea he exists they wouldnt care if they did and they would be more afraid of the negative publicity of shutting this guy down than just ignoring him note i present no evidence of my assertions but neither do the author of the linked article taking all this into consideration its clear that louis has been threatened by apple ah weve gone from allusions to downright statements of fact no evidence of this whatsoever but its clear its just as clear the guy is making up a fight with apple to get reddits panties in a bundle punching up and all that no one had heard of this guy before hed decided apple was out to get him now it actually could be that apple is hitting him with a lawsuit or asserting hes in violation of ip law but in the absence of evidence i am skeptical again i could be the one thats wrong but you sure as fuck wouldnt see me writing an article asserting that apple is out to get this guy might as well have a headline that says apple secrets revealed tim cook hates this man and maybe just maybe wait until theres an actual filing in an actual court with real lawyers laying out a real case then you could see who has a problem with whom rather than unsubstantiated speculation because even if you can show that yes apple is indeed going after this guy that apple legal is coming down on him until you see the actual filing you cant know what the objection is or even which party is in the right or you know fuck apple because reasons and free speech also fuck scripts that hijack my clipboard and do shit like this read more at and fuck the people that write them or use them
technology,not_removed,guy fuck you apple suck my dick i dare you to try and stop me from repairing your shitty pieces of shit apple ok how about a legal complaint if the guy had just made educational videos and remained professional about the issue then i highly doubt anything would have happened to his channel or his business but he chose to be as hostile and offensive towards apple as possible its really not surprising that apple would feel a need to defend their brand when someone is openly accusing them of fraud and shoddy workmanship on a public forum
technology,not_removed,ok i have a stupid question is apple actually suing louis rossman or is this just the assumption everyones going off on he posted a video implying people download his videos i could be anything from a cease and desist letter to the fbi going after him yeah its very likely that its apple considering everything else but it might not be them suing it could be a cease and desist letter any company with copyrighted and trademarked material must actively protect them or risk loosing them the title is stating something as a fact that as far as i know is only speculation and might be considered slanderous
technology,not_removed,yeah bad title this story has zero sources and no confirmation we can all watch the video let the public speculate on its own
technology,not_removed,someone please point me to the court filings on this case if apple is suing what district is the case being brought in what are they maintaining in the lawsuit im waiting
technology,not_removed,this is why this sub isnt a default anymore the mods are letting in any apple witch hunt get on top without any moderation
technology,not_removed,no comment on the article but can we fucking get a grip on what constitutes someones freedom of speech being taken away
technology,not_removed,so this article was written by a guy that did no more than copypaste the exact same things that were on reddit before i hoped at least some hard evidence or an statement
technology,not_removed,no lawsuit apparently apples attorneys and arguably apple themselves are fans of the channel still theres more to come
technology,not_removed,free speech under attack no but this is the perfect kind competently overblown uninformed vague outrage fodder for the average reddit wanker
technology,not_removed,so far all of this looks like conjecture im waiting for something a bit more solid than a random site reading between the lines about some random guys youtube channel
technology,not_removed,he actually just posted another video stating he isnt being sued but isnt sure what will actually happen from it link
technology,not_removed,his edit he says very clearly i am not being suedlol
technology,not_removed,i wonder if apple had the lawyer change tactics because of the backlash they were seeing online now with this
technology,not_removed,apple has no legal authority to sanction or otherwise intimidate thirdparty repair shops who offer apple product repair services apple while aware of this can play the i dont give a fuck card and throw lawyers at it until they can shut down said repair shop our judicial system turns on resources the party with the most resources wins right or wrong i hope louis can drum up some good legal counsel maybe the eff will help him out
technology,not_removed,this was a huge overreaction here is a to the an updated video apple is not suing him things are still vague at the moment however it will not likely end up in a law suit
technology,not_removed,itt people who dont use apple products who are really upset about the repairability of apple products people also dramatically confused at how people keep buying more macs as the pc industry as a whole declines
technology,not_removed,apple has been doing this ever sense the apple came out in the if you sell or repair apple products you can only sell items approved by apple if you caught they will blackball you and you will never get anymore product from apple apple will actively go after anyone who tries to party add ons to their products
technology,not_removed,i asked this in another thread but what other electronics companies give board schematics to repair shops
technology,not_removed,its actually a lot more than just that actually it has almost nothing to do with that the guy plasters apple ip all over his videos without permission thats illegal
technology,not_removed,fuck apple for doing this going after a small business owner who is just trying to make a living and is obviously really good at what he does i hope apple offers him a job or something at the end of all of this
technology,not_removed,ok so i would really love to help i took a few electrical and computer engineering classes in college last semester and would enjoy going over boards to possibly generate schematics im not too fluent in it though but with help of others and a nice microscope maybe we could start releasing diagramsschematics open source style that are reverse engineered free to use that way they cant sue anyone else i really hate big businesses attempts to prevent people from fixing their own products its such an evil thing to do
technology,not_removed,taking all this into consideration its clear that louis has been threatened by apple is this a joke im not saying hes for sure not being sued or even that its unlikely that hes being sued but outright stating that apple has a vendetta and is suing this guy based on an ominous youtube video is some rumormongering tabloid bullshit
technology,not_removed,this is boldfaced slander there is absolutely zero evidence that apple is involved further the individual received a cease and desist letter which is not a lawsuit even more absurd is that this individual is allowed to publish the cease and desist letter there doesnt have to be baseless speculation instead he purposefully withholds information to whip reactionary idiots in the tech industry into a frenzy you are being scammed by a narcissistic attention whore
technology,not_removed,guy sounds like a negative nancy
technology,not_removed,apple or not there is a piece of shit out there suing this guy for teaching people how to fix their own property lets all support louis and hope he comes out of this strong as ever
technology,not_removed,he does live in the usa what do people expect freedom from corporate control he lives in an economy already sold to wall street so it should not be a surprise to anyone
technology,not_removed,httpslouisrossmanncom
technology,not_removed,oh shit ive watched this guys videos he seems like a cool dude his stances are very firm but theyre also very well reasoned this really sucks for him
technology,not_removed,lol free knowledge unacceptable
technology,not_removed,iono i watched a couple of his videos and his video they link in the article why i dont use apple products is pretty weird he claims a couple weird things claims you cant copy and paste on an iphone yes you can tap and hold select what you want to copy and then hit copy claims you cant move music from an iphoneipod to a computer and that all party applications that claim they can cant yes you can mediamonkey has been able to do this for years a couple other weird claims that arent truemake your own judgement
technology,not_removed,updated video maybe not getting sued
technology,not_removed,the title is inaccurate at this time there isnt an active lawsuit the law firm has only said that they are fans of him and that one or of his videos have things it them that they would rather was changed im guessing from his mentioning specifically a schematic its because the schematics are covered by copyright and that him showing these schematics on his channel could be interpreted as illegal sharing much like in the same way if someone pointed a camera at a book and turned page by page till it ended it could be seen as breech of copyright because the book is protected his situation can be explained as legal intimidation by having the lawyers contact him instead of being a manager from apple if it was a manager or director at apple maybe from a similar field to him it could be seen as industry guys having a chat but talking through lawyers is a very aggressive way of opening a dialogue
technology,not_removed,im not saying he deserves it but why are people surprised by this he wasnt just teaching people how to repair their apple products he was waging his own personal war against apple he came at apple with everything he had and not surprisingly apple responded
technology,not_removed,he talked a ton of shit and now looks like he is going to pay for it literally
technology,not_removed,its like i woke up in bizarro world fuck the criminals the terrorists the wall street fraud the biggest threat in the us is self repair techs what a joke the us has become
technology,not_removed,this article is one of the most clickbaity ones ive seen in a long time it also leaves out the part where he has obtained schematics circuit diagrams supposedly pirated diagnostic etc software that appleauthorized repairmanufacturer employees are normally required to sign an nda before using and hes posted videos to youtube of himself doing it to show other people how to get them
technology,not_removed,this is confirmed httpmotherboardvicecomreadwarrantyvoidifremovedstickersareillegal
technology,not_removed,yeah i figured this is what he was talking about the other day his sincerity about being hush hush made me assume it was apple fuckin sad really not only that they would do this but that we live in a world where its increasingly possible to hold consumers hostage with regard to repair accessibility
technology,not_removed,holy shit game revolution those guys have been around for like years
technology,not_removed,it hasnt been confirmed yet that apple is behind this
technology,not_removed,this guy comes off a smug in a bunch of his videos but over all no one deserves to be sued for teaching someone to repair anything imaging if chevy sued people on youtube that showed you how to fix your brakes
technology,not_removed,yeah its not exactly the best has to be the sweetner and not sugar since it wont mix the extra lemon slices go a long way too one lemon wedge cut it
technology,not_removed,it is not illegal to mod and xbox so it should not be illegal to repair a laptop when i purchase a property i have the right to modify it any way i see fit
technology,not_removed,thats just management acting in the shareholders best interests
technology,not_removed,i dont even understand what you people do to break your computer in the first place
technology,not_removed,at least air is free
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,what city is he in anyone know
technology,not_removed,video
technology,not_removed,this is very sad
technology,not_removed,i support louis and find him entertaining but like many smart people he fails to ask himself such a simple question that should be eminently answerable for someone with even a modicum of intelligence if you rail against a corporation with a branded product and affect its sales wtf do you expect dumbass and who told you that you have a right to do that with no consequences
technology,not_removed,updoot
technology,not_removed,this is what happened in the robots movie
technology,not_removed,so i read about this yesterday apple cant actually go after this guy could they i mean people buy the product they can do as they please if it breaks then they can fix it themselves this guy just shows them how if a company van get away with this that means that nissan can sue me for me fixing my own car as opposed to taking it to a dealer becaue of these people are being charged that means whatever broke was outside of apples warranty be it too old or human error so why would they come after this random guy there is no way that this is even a remotely justifiable move
technology,not_removed,i would love an ama with this fella
technology,not_removed,my guess is theyre going to give him a cease and desist for showing certain schematics and informing watchers how to obtain said schematics
technology,not_removed,they are just telling louis that repair guys like him can operate cause apple allows it apple dont want to provide costly support like louis does apple is externalizing advanced repair on a larger scale just look at how repairs goes apple cant afford a loss when they have to say they cant repair something so instead they have standardised repair that will work more often the lawyers just want to say hey good work but dont push them thats the message if they want you dead you would be dead
technology,not_removed,itd be cool if he was overseas
technology,not_removed,itt res ignored duplicate link
technology,not_removed,lol starts video by saying he is going to be succinct and get to the point repeats everything twice and goes on for minutes
technology,not_removed,can someone tldr that minute video
technology,not_removed,fan of your channel slimey charm and disarm negotiation tactic watch out
technology,not_removed,oh wow all the year old lawyers who spend all their time playing games were wrong that never happens on reddit
technology,not_removed,no he meant there is no lawsuit thus far he doesnt know what the firms email is about and it could still be a lawsuit well know tomorrow or next week editlol typo fart
technology,not_removed,i really like louis but that was a minute video not saying a whole lot
technology,not_removed,people always say the apple store sent them to us i worked concessions at an outdoor theater for a few weeks once long shows outside in the hot sun we were selling water bottles for a bottle i used to tell people that balked at the price about the guy with a cooler who was just outside the gate who was selling them for a dollar apples retail employees arent getting paid enough to want to screw over consumers apples lawyers are
technology,not_removed,its because youre dealing with noncorporate people
technology,not_removed,we apple store technicians would regularly refer people to smaller repair shops if they couldnt afford or want to pay the price we offered we only had one price to offer for the repair but often would have the opportunity to repair or replace for free if there werent obvious signs of neglect unfortunately there are quite regularly obvious signs of neglect
technology,not_removed,i used to work for apple and when ever someone didnt like the options i was able to give them in the store we have very little control of those options btw i would send them to the next best thing usually along the lines of well you could try this or that place if you have a warranty with us still it will void it but they will probably fix it for cheaper just give them all the info and let them make up their mind
technology,not_removed,its kind of like jiffy lube vs taking your car to a dealer for an oil change right there is precedence albeit another market
technology,not_removed,giving the consumer full market price information are you crazy
technology,not_removed,i was charged an ass and a dick having the sata cable replaced on my macbook at a small momandpop computer electronics store
technology,not_removed,i worked at a chain store for a bit that sold tractor equipment our manager actually had an envelope behind the register with a bunch of cards for nearby places that would have smaller parts wed need to order obviously were supposed to just tell them to order it with us but weirdly enough when you get people to work with customers all day they dont want to fuck them over
technology,not_removed,the guys working at the apple store are computer techs just like anywhere else they recognize the fuckery that apple does to its customers and their concern usually is just to get the customer what they need
technology,not_removed,this is absolutely about the schematics if they were just pissed about people repairing their own stuff ifixit would have been sued into oblivion a long time ago
technology,not_removed,i came in to say this seems premature to assume its apple yes he calls them out a lot but he also just released a scathing video on yelp could be them as well
technology,not_removed,yeah article manages to tell us nothing but pure conjecture and it blows up anyway
technology,not_removed,its been confirmed to be untrue rtechnology yet again proving they completely shit the bed over apple
technology,not_removed,this should be top comment im expecting it to be true but until it is confirmed its downright unethical for op to title this post apple is suing a man
technology,not_removed,this needs to be higher up the man literally said nothing in his video
technology,not_removed,its antiapple and its on reddit doesnt matter if it is confirmed or not
technology,not_removed,confirmation didnt catch the boston bomber we did or wait
technology,not_removed,he uploaded an update on the topic and at least for now he isnt being sued by apple or anyone else
technology,not_removed,it is apple
technology,not_removed,shhhhh the hive is stirring
technology,not_removed,doesnt matter this is reddit and were talking about apple please stop trying to interfere with a typical circle jerk
technology,not_removed,no theres none all we have is the video all hes said is hes facing a large issue legal in nature which may result in his business andor his youtube channel being shut down since then people have made assumptions presented them as fact and others have reported on those speculations as if they were fact all we know is what he said in a cryptic video yesterday he didnt say apple he didnt say lawsuit he didnt say sue he didnt say copyright he didnt say schematics he said nothing like that yet people in this thread are making very specific claims ah so this confirms the feds are raiding his shop at the behest of apple over copyrighted schematics no reddit stahp edit update louis has since tweeted this
technology,not_removed,this is my thought i have seen similar stories elsewhere pop up today and i have not seen a shred of evidence just conjecture that it must be apple suing him rossman has explained multiple times how hes made bad business decisions and run multiple businesses that failed so it seems a little premature to assume that apple is suing him instead of waiting for more information to come out
technology,not_removed,this is reddit and reddit hates apple no proof is needed now if a big media company did that it would be pitchforks from the same people on reddit who will happily believe anything they are told that fits their predetermined conclusion
technology,not_removed,theres no proof just speculation however it says much about the public opinion of apples practices that everyone is ready to accept they were behind this
technology,not_removed,yeah thats my problem here too i wanna support him but not even in the article is there concrete proof apple or anyone for that matter is suing him
technology,not_removed,apple gets you clicks thats the only reason
technology,not_removed,sorry i cant hear you over my ad revenue apple bashing and outrage culture
technology,not_removed,there is no lawsuit in the video he talks about the same antirepair legislation that weve all heard about before and uses that as cause to take down his own videos which somehow got turned into apple is suing him the guy is a serial drama queen and reddit eats it up
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,so you take his work and leave him to defend himself alone the guy helped everyone and expected nothing in return when he gets introuble for it all you can say is oh well we got what we needed why is there no boycott being organized
technology,not_removed,because circlejerk
technology,not_removed,i cant wait until we find out this is just a large media company placing false claims on his videos and trying to bully him with court bills this happens to youtubers every day
technology,not_removed,what have people told you about witch hunts that they saved salem
technology,not_removed,shhh everyone is here to hate on apple without any confirmation on a serious note if its apple this is pretty shitty but people are being to quick to judge without really knowing whats happening
technology,not_removed,i cant hear you over the sound of redditors sharpening their apple pitchforks
technology,not_removed,exactly the hive mind is so unbelievably scary
technology,not_removed,spoiler alert it turns out it wasnt true
technology,not_removed,its usually the same people who rip on the media that will happily spin conjecture that fits their needs
technology,not_removed,its even worse title says lawsuit by the end its a presumed threat
technology,not_removed,wow a witch hunt over apple over something no one knew any details about you dont say but fuck apple right
technology,not_removed,its not the eu the eu directive youre thinking of gives protection for just two years which was superceded by the uk sale of goods act of and is now superceded by the consumer rights act this does not mean a year warranty this means a year period to make a claim if the fault was present within the first months of purchase which is still considered the supply period after the first six months the burden is on the consumer to prove that the product was faulty at the time of purchase apple gave you a new one because either a there was a recognised fault in that line of product within the first six months unlikely because they told you to go away or b a new mac book is cheaper for them than a court appearance extremely likely
technology,not_removed,soooo in the future when the uk leaves eu for good will that still be the case
technology,not_removed,years from the date of purchase source ive heard two years of which the first six months are basically a seller has to repair unless he can prove you broke it instead of you have to prove it was faulty
technology,not_removed,sounds super easy
technology,not_removed,i always thought its a year warranty for appliances under eu laws where did you get in my country they tend to limit warranties even to year for example my says year warranty after the date of purchase on the receipt ofc i know i can stress it to two if i go after them but
technology,not_removed,yup not just that but those schematics could easily be wrong leading to damage on someones device and apple does love protecting their image so the last thing they need is for some repair shop to fuck something up and then they have to take the blame for it much like how party home buttons were bricking peoples phones but somehow that was apples fault
technology,not_removed,the schematics are either a leaked b stolen c reverse engineered in my opinion it doesnt matter and in most cases its likely a combination of the why doesnt it matter because the schematics show nothing that isnt already public domain i am typing this comment on an iphone i could theoretically open this up grab a mmeter and troubleshoot my way to a page iphone schematic this is not intellectual property when we buy the phone we by the schematic in its constructed form apple does not own the schematics we all do
technology,not_removed,he does hey may expose himself for doing so he always goes on to explain though im forced to do this because apple refuses to make schematics available to repair shops he stepped into the crosshairs to highlight the issue watch his videos about the right to repair bill etc
technology,not_removed,the headline is definitely misleading the writer of the article correctly uses the word alludes but op certainly doesnt bother
technology,not_removed,you oldfashioned journalist
technology,not_removed,at my job i repair macs dells and hps and let me tell you everything about an apple repair is much much more pleasant than the other two
technology,not_removed,yup watched it this morning should be top comment
technology,not_removed,there was never any lawsuit reddit once again over reacted
technology,not_removed,linus went to him actually louis made a video calling linus out for baking his gpu so linus went to new york to see louis and was taught how to do it properly it was all handled really profesionally
technology,not_removed,i watched one and his arrogance seemed to only specifically stem from how apple handled their business as in if a guy said a fucking baby could do this he isnt necessarily being arrogant but saying that if a baby could do this then why are they charging so much money they are dicks
technology,not_removed,incredibly arrogant and obnoxious his personality has nothing to do with a legal problem if he didnt break any laws then that shouldnt sway your opinion on legal issues only look at the facts not your feelings
technology,not_removed,second this one i get the frustration he has against apple and yeah most of the time shit is outrageous but for the majority working there we want to really help you with as little charge as possible
technology,not_removed,i dont get why so many people want apple to be evil on the internet for a company of their size they seem pretty decent they protect their customers and try and make nice products they dont sell your information and ensure privacy fuck them right
technology,not_removed,but he chose to be as hostile and offensive towards apple as possible its really not surprising that apple would feel a need to defend their brand when someone is openly accusing them of fraud and shoddy workmanship on a public forum so we are allowed to have our lives ruined because we said what we felt think about that for a second even if he is wrong the penalty does not fit the crime lets make the guy homeless that will show him lets make an example of him so they all know to never question a corporation ever again should apple be able to defend themselves yes but his life shouldnt be ruined if said person did not commit a felony crime why should we defend corporations greedy practices if we let his life get destroyed over this whats stopping this from happening to others saying hurtful things about companies
technology,not_removed,thats not the problem here though louis specifically zerosin on the notion that even a simple rectrace of a lead with generic wire is apparently destroying apples intellectual property while yes im sure they will take issue with that as well this is a mere matter of principle apple doesnt want anyone taking business from them for any reason that is their strategy on all accounts proprietary cables walled off ecosystems secretive repair practices etc
technology,not_removed,same thing with the press negative review when you can be easily singled out among a sea of mostly positive ones no more reviews for you
technology,not_removed,its far from clear what is actually happening here the article is speculative and overwrought who the fuck doesnt know that apple makes their products hard to repair and tightly controls availability of parts that hes facing a lawsuit from apple is totally plausible but at this point we dont know that for a fact and we definitely dont know the specifics of what apple may or may not be claiming what seems more plausible to me is that apple may be pressuring googleyoutube to take down his channel for some bs reason youtube bends over and drops its pants to fellow corporations when they cough so who knows maybe he feels that without his youtube channels marketing value his business would fail
technology,not_removed,and is obviously really good at what he does this was the guy who didnt know a gigabyte from a gigabit and made a whole conspiracy theory video about a part of the macbooks webcam that he didnt understand lets not oversell him here
technology,not_removed,just trying to make a living not that im not on his side but louis is absolutely antiapple and encourages others to be as well
technology,not_removed,heres me hoping apple takes a massive pr hit loses business and is forced to change their strategy but sure give him a job thatll solve everything
technology,not_removed,because if your computer crashes because it was repaired wrong it doesnt kill you yet
technology,not_removed,louis was working on computers legally you can mm your way through a board and build your own schematic and fix computers at your house all day long apple wont care obtain the schematics illegally and brag about it online and go viral good luck against apples lawyers i have yet to see an argument that can defend him in this aspect
technology,not_removed,why does a small repair company have the right to make money off a manufacturer while dealerships are typically equipped to perform service they typically cant handle the volume outside mechanics help cover the demand that the dealerships cant apple can handle the demand themselves and they do so very efficiently theres no need for an external source because there are no leftovers for them to begin with honestly as good as they are with servicing their products i wouldnt be inclined to take it elsewhere anyway
technology,not_removed,apples lawyers didnt contact him to wish him happy birthday
technology,not_removed,but how come ifixit is still up and running selling third party batteries and such and isnt the lawsuit over the schematics of apple products and not necessarily the howto videos he has posted
technology,not_removed,no its not dude is showing confidential apple schematics on his youtube channel
technology,not_removed,i believe he was talking about the gen
technology,not_removed,i dont see any mention of rossmann in that article so i dont see how it confirms that apple is suing him
technology,not_removed,wait what this article doesnt mention louis rossman and it was put out days before louis cryptic video how does this confirm apple is suing louis so far this is nothing but speculation all louis has said is hes facing a large issue today legal in nature and the result could be that he loses his business he hasnt said apple he hasnt said sue he hasnt said schematics he hasnt said copyright yet weve got people in comments sections wildly speculating some have said so this confirms it the feds have been called to raid his shop what the fuck reddit all we know is louis says hes facing a legal issue and it could be the end of his business can we just leave it at that spread awareness about that until we actually know some facts here
technology,not_removed,theres still no confirmation some blogger just watched the video came to the obvious conclusion and posting saying this is definitely whats happening its still all speculation we can assume apple because thatd be the most obvious answer but i for one am waiting for actual information before i go overreacting to this
technology,not_removed,well who else would be threatening him
technology,not_removed,when i purchase a property i have the right to modify it any way i see fit unfortunately thats not the case for software youre purchasing a license and part of the agreement often is you wont decompilemodifyreverse engineer the product from what i know hardware has similar usage agreements but i havent looked into it
technology,not_removed,sometimes they pour soda in them or kick them for being bad
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,he also said he was bad at being succinct and to the point
technology,not_removed,youtube revenue is based on viewership and duration
technology,not_removed,tldw apple enjoys his content apple has problems with malicious repair techs they spoke about that his lawyer spoke to apple about the video with the pcb schematics that were illegally obtained we assume this i guess if i understood everything his shop was closed and raided because of that he hints many many times that apple is unhappy about something despite what theyre saying to his lawyer from what i gather he believes it may be a lawsuit regarding slander or something like that what he says on his channel its still developing and he has no idea what theyre trying to do exactly it could be positive though unlikely
technology,not_removed,yeah that stood out to me as well as it is a fairly transparent tactic its a negotiating tool meant to disarm the opposition they play the good cop so you are more willing to come to their side of whatever dispute
technology,not_removed,thats the way louis videos always are
technology,not_removed,a bottle pshh here in miami if youre at a club and its time to sober up and you just want a cup of ice water the bartenders will offer you a bottle of that nasty nestle water and you can argue all you want she wont give you the ice water unless you already have a couple dollars on the counter for her tip otherwise shell walk away and ignore you
technology,not_removed,same here i work in honda parts and there are things like remote cases that honda doesnt sell separately so if someones remote breaks they have to spend on a brand new one i will tell those customers that they can get just the case on ebay for less than shipped but it wont have the honda logo on it and most dont care thats not hondas policy its not the dealerships policy its mine
technology,not_removed,exactly im in a different retail field but ive got no hesitation referring people to competitors that can provide a service we dont i get paid fairly decently for retail and its still nowhere near enough to care more about my companys bottom line vs making the guy in front of me happy assuming hes not being a dick or otherwise acting objectionably at least
technology,not_removed,shhh the corporate ones might shut down that collaboration if they found out what were up to
technology,not_removed,the majority of good employees at retail jobs that customers actually like would be fired by corporate whenever a store is doing really good and the company wonders i wonder what theyre doing that the other stores arent the answer is usually that the place has chill employees that dont follow corporate policies and act like fake douchebags that drive customers away people want to interact with real people not cutouts
technology,not_removed,so people with actual souls
technology,not_removed,i felt ripped off when apple wanted to fix my phones screen but then the guy came out from the back and told me they were just going to replace the whole phone for the same price and i was like maybe some of you are ok i dropped and overheated the old one so many times
technology,not_removed,is it because apple mostly just replaces failed components that is if its a bad logic board you replace the logic board you dont get out a soldering iron and fix it is that correct
technology,not_removed,apples definition of neglect is a pretty strict one too and for the cost of the machine while not offering accidental damage coverage yeeeeah thats just a shit deal not feeling much sympathy for the company as a whole that loses business to people that frankly offer a competitive rate and get the job done with minimal bullshit youre obviously not the guy that comes up with these shitty policies its good that you realize the shit that the company you work for tries to pull and you give customers fair recommendations well done keep up the good work
technology,not_removed,you guys saved my ass once when i didnt even deserve it i accidentally jumped into a pool with my iphone and i bleached one of the water sensors to make it look like it didnt get wet little did i know at the time that there was a second external one and two on the inside which obviously had turned red after playing dumb they came back and said out of the water sensors were tripped and the inside of the phone was filled with rust they still gave be a new iphone for free best customer service ive ever had and ive bought more apple stuff since then partially because of it
technology,not_removed,unfortunately there are quite regularly obvious signs of neglect i get that they shouldnt be expected to honor the warranty in the case of obvious neglect but the system is often abused in favor of the company
technology,not_removed,i just had this same experience when he was talking i mentioned the name of the store i figured he was referring to and he said yeah thats the one we were looking at getting an ssd installed to replace my friends dying macbook hard drive i dealt with him the next month with a problem phone he remembered me and took care of everything like a champ i sometimes get slightly testy techs but thats been the rarity but i do think this is apple doing something outside of the store level possibly not even because they want to but because if they dont it fucks something up for them somehow
technology,not_removed,hello fellow apple tech im phone support not in store going to a party will invalidate the warranty then apple will never touch it again at least thats what we have to tell people that bork at paying £ for a battery replament that said your conversation with the customer is not been recorded so
technology,not_removed,httpmotherboardvicecomreadwarrantyvoidifremovedstickersareillegal
technology,not_removed,you said it perfectly fixing peoples tech is rewarding
technology,not_removed,upvoted for the last paragraph my boss gives me shit because i fix laptops by just ordering parts dispatch under warranty instead of having a tech dispatched i like hardware i just dont get to work with it much with the adoption of virtual machines
technology,not_removed,besides just because they arent a customer now doesnt mean theyll never be one
technology,not_removed,taking your car to jiffy lube wont void your warranty letting someone work on your macbook will that said if youre needing to go that route youre probably not under warranty anymore anyway
technology,not_removed,except that computer fixit shops dont cross thread your drain plug or leave the old filter gasket stuck to the engine so your oil ends up all over the road and your engine is ruined
technology,not_removed,so maybe instead of getting all high and mighty on reddit pretending that seeding a torrent with his videos is helping he hinted in his video that his fanbase should do this just in case they would not have done it if louis had not dropped the hints that he wanted the videos copied
technology,not_removed,right to repair already exists as a federal law i cant remember the name of it but it falls under warranty protections on mobile seeking source help
technology,not_removed,people are going to assume apple is going after louis for the schematics he buys but for what purpose schematics for apple products arent hard to obtain and if they are suing louis for profiting off of stolen ip the end goal would be money for damages and lost revenue and louis doesnt have enough money for apple to take to make a case very worthwhile when there are much bigger fish to fry when it comes to suing for ip money eg samsung so why would apple choose to sue louis if he doesnt have any worthwhile money the answer to that is that apple probably isnt pursing money at all apples eventual goal is to prevent you and anyone else from doing repairs on an apple product unless its by one of their authorized repair centers by preventing legislation allowing you to do so from being passed right to repair bill so why doesnt apple go after other repair businesses like ifixit is it cause ifixit doesnt divulge ip no ifixit themselves have divulged sensitive ip before and also keep in mind that ifixit divulged secrets of an unreleased product while louis shows schematics of laptops as noted by louis one of the arguments apple and lobbyists have against the right to repair bill is that the difference between ifixit and louis is that ifixit merely disassembles apple products and tells you to replace entire pcbs with an oem one if something is broken this is what authorized apple repair centers already do and any replacement pcbs originate from apple themselves so its harder for apple to argue that replacing an entire pcb with an oem one alters an apple product especially since they do it themselves already on the other hand louis teaches people how to repair apple products on a pcb component level and in some cases fixes entire burnt traces by soldering wires or replaces some components with what he judges to be better ones even for components as simple as a resistor since the bill of materials for apple products demands a cm like foxconn to only use specific mpns manufacturer part number for each specific component if you were to replace a resistor with a nonapproved mpn despite having the same exact properties or replace a resistor with one that has a different tolerance apple could argue that you are altering an apple product to become an nonapple product to some extent apple has a point if you were to replace all the parts of a honda civic with aftermarket parts would it still be a honda civic at what point does a honda civic become not a honda civic if you were to replace each part with aftermarket parts one by one would you be tarnishing the honda brand by driving around in said aftermarket honda civic that did not perform like a honda civic while still displaying the honda civic badge those are some interesting thought questions however on the other hand if you were to only replace the spark plugs in a honda civic with aftermarket spark plugs almost everyone will agree that it is still a honda civic and likewise if you got into a car crash and had to get the front of your honda civic rebuilt with some aftermarket parts people would still agree that it is a honda civic from apples point of view since ifixit only tells you to replace entire assemblies with oem assemblies while louis teaches people how to people how to alter apple products going after louis and winning helps apple achieve legal precedent to prevent people from altering apple products in the future whereas going after ifixit will only achieve a little monetary gain which is nice but not what apple is after
technology,not_removed,well theres your problem you bought lemons from the apple store
technology,not_removed,shhh dont call them lemons i wrote a long letter to apple corporate after i had my macbook pro repaired times for the same problem the battery was going bad after a month of use anyways in the letter i told them a store employee told me it sounded like i got a lemon and to give their new product a go and that i would like to talk about another repair other than giving me another battery shortly after they received the letter i was contacted by executive relations apologizing that i was told that i got a lemon and that since i was now out of warranty i could buy a new battery it irked me that the main reason for their contact want to right their wrong in the product quality but to apologize for me hearing such a harsh word as lemon and to assure me they would have a talk with the store and fix that needless to say i stopped giving them my money
technology,not_removed,fans cannot separate brand loyalty from their own egos so they attack victims so much advertising and marketing isnt accidental they add the advertising cost to every product to teach their customers how to think different
technology,not_removed,im on his side and im also not buying any more apple products
technology,not_removed,it is apple
technology,not_removed,its antiapple in rtechnology the rest of the world and in people on reddit just use their macs and nobody gives a fuck it was taken off the default subs for this reason
technology,not_removed,yes this guy is using outrage to make money the suckers are clicking away
technology,not_removed,it sounds like anything could be up maybe his large legal issue is him going to jail for something like murder its probably not but theres also no proof its not yet
technology,not_removed,he even says himself on twitter that hes not being sued so
technology,not_removed,outrage culture so hot right now
technology,not_removed,i kept the title as lame as possible for the initial video i wanted it to be viewed by my core audience not have it turn into a viral thing that was silly one thing i realize is that speaking to subscribers is different from speaking to subscribers which is different from speaking to different from different from different from theres more to think about with more people receiving a message
technology,not_removed,uses that as cause to take down his own videos umm what link
technology,not_removed,he just put out a video that all but told people to download the videos while they were still up i got the distinct impression that whatever happens from this point on he feels it must be that those videos still be accessible
technology,not_removed,if you read that thread or watch his last video he is giving hard hints for everyone to do exactly what they did to save his videos since they will be taken down
technology,not_removed,they ripped his videos to preserve them in case apple makes youtube delete everythingyouve got it all wrong friendo
technology,not_removed,what the fuck are we supposed to do to stop a billion dollar company complain on the internet
technology,not_removed,if you watched this guys video hes essentially advertising himself as a martyr to this cause he full understood what he was doing from the start and the repurcussions he totally anticipated it happening he just wanted the rest of us to know that we dont have to get screwed over by shady business practices
technology,not_removed,youre talking in ignorance its to maintain his videos on youtube if his channel gets taken down
technology,not_removed,go ahead and organize a boycott no ones stopping you while youre at it read the article where they reference him asking people to download the videos or better yet watch the video where he asks people to download the videos
technology,not_removed,i feel youve grossly misunderstood the significance of ensuring we have a freely available copy of his work as well as what he actually wants given your manufactured outrage its clear you dont actually watch his videos
technology,not_removed,why is there no boycott being organized a boycott against what exactly have you read exactly what theyre upset about do you understand the technicalities of what hes doing and the legality of the information he is advocating i think if you were to understand the answers to these questions youd see why a boycott is not a brilliant move
technology,not_removed,i agree boycott this guys videos oh maybe thats not what you meant then lets boycott youtube for not taking his videos down no boycott apple im guessing thats what you want what did apple do again because as far as i can see theres no evidence they even know this guy exists maybe its just me but i like to have facts before i go grabbing the pitchforks maybe apple is genuinely pissed about what hes doing so maybe reserve judgment to see what they are objecting to before making up your mind nah fuck that better to rail against the man
technology,not_removed,well that wasnt implied in the post but okay someone can talk about a positive action without mentioning another thing while that thing is still going to happen if that makes sense
technology,not_removed,lol the notion that redditors would collectively boycott apple
technology,not_removed,welcome to any apple related threads i had filters set up but res updating wiped them all out again because they refuse to code the extension for firefox properly
technology,not_removed,or he is full of shit
technology,not_removed,on a serious note if its apple this is pretty shitty im pretty sure it will come out shortly that theyre not upset with him for sharing repair tips theyre upset about advocating using stolen data
technology,not_removed,its just been getting worse and worse
technology,not_removed,you are spot on thanks i was wrong its uk law extended from eu law i think that apple gave me a new imac for both your a and b reasons like all big corporations their first line of defence is just to tell you to go away regardless of the facts — at which point something like of complainants will just disappear then after that they dont want to go to court for two reasons time and expense they dont want to set a legal precedence that can be used by future customers with the same or similar issue note that they also gave me an apple gift card for £ ukp as well so they were quite good about it all as regards the proof required of what is effectively a manufacturing issue this is a grey area obviously the fault was not showing when i brought the product the screen was working fine but then the fault started to develop or years later so the question is what could have caused that fault apart from an initial manufacturing issue was the imac shaken at some point got too hot or too cold in many cases you can show that the fault could not have been caused by you on the balance of probabilities which is the civil burden of proof eg what could i have done to stop a cpu chip from working or pixels to go dead and the whole point of the year rule is that the law is saying when you purchase an electronic device it should work for at least years and of course it was easy to pop on the internet and find stories of numerous other imac owners with the exact same issue if i had gone to court i would have printed these out and taken them with me i had also served apple with a notice to tell me how many imacs of the same model they had fixed with the same issue since they started manufacturing that model they never gave me that information of course and i would have used that in court against them 😀
technology,not_removed,this is actually a rule from the uk in the eu the warranty is a minimum of two years under eu law consumers are offered a twoyear guarantee in which sellers must repair or replace a faulty or notfitforpurpose item but this right is trumped by the sixyear warranty in the uks own legislation this is a case in which the eu sets a minimum and if any country wants to provide more through their own legislation they are allowed to to protect the consumer so i suppose that the uk will keep this even after leaving the eu
technology,not_removed,its on apples website 😀 httpwwwapplecomuklegalstatutorywarranty
technology,not_removed,the shane dawson whoa super triple take on that one
technology,not_removed,if its reverse engineered its legal leaked or stolen not so much
technology,not_removed,ianal but i doubt what you say is true and you do not buy the schematic when you buy your phone you are well within your rights to reverse engineer and document yourself but the official company documentation is copyrighted if you obtained that document through it being leaked or stolen than im sure you can get into trouble for that
technology,not_removed,does it really work like that serious question when you buy food do you also own the recipe
technology,not_removed,neither do like half of the comments here ill never use another product again apple is so anti consumer i hope the company goes under with the pr backlash its like how when apple was fighting the whole phone breaking things almost every single comments started with i dont like apple but like how the fuck does that qualify you or do you just have to get that out there did you know im a vegan
technology,not_removed,honestly the video doesnt allude to anyone its a safe guess but pretending its anything more than speculation is kind of silly
technology,not_removed,that has also been my experience it can be the difference between an hour long job and a hour long job for the same procedure
technology,not_removed,have any links to the videos or something
technology,not_removed,i wouldnt even care if this piece was properly sourced had some semblance of evidence a quote from both partys lawyers a link to a case maybe a quote something instead you get crap writing and mob mentality based on nothing the lack of critical thinking in this thread is staggering
technology,not_removed,but he talked bad about apple hes reddits savior theres no satisfying the eboners being flopped around
technology,not_removed,dude fumbles between gb gb asks why a webcam has gigglebites attached to it compared to previous models points out you should be paranoid about mics over webcams no light hard wired in circuit to show status makes enough money everyday for the last two years to pay shop rent buy consumables insurance pay his own salary and the salary of employees in new york city about to fight apple and alludes to being able to stay afloat for at least a few months which points to some nestegg hes been able to establish lets not throw the baby out with the tubwater either or drop dollars penny pinching
technology,not_removed,agreed reddit fell way in love with this guy way too fast and now the hivemind treats all he says as gospel despite its merit like ive said before i agree with right to repair i just dont care for louiss schtick that much and i dont buy the higher ethicalmoral reasons thing guy is just looking out for his next pay check and theres nothing wrong with that but dont spin me some yarn about big bad corporation is out to get me personally individually
technology,not_removed,apple have in the bank a pr hit isnt much
technology,not_removed,lol literally no one will care
technology,not_removed,but would it not be safer to bring your car to an authorized dealer rather then some random to have it repaired who knows what that random could do at least you know authorized dealers have only the highest quality personal who have spent years learning about the specific type of vehicle s
technology,not_removed,an exploding lipo battery can kill you or at least severely burn you
technology,not_removed,why would gen matter in when the video was made still weird
technology,not_removed,because people want to be outraged and will just see is confirmed with a blue link to a website theyve heard of before
technology,not_removed,thank you for the clarification given we know the locale and defendant shouldnt we be able to ascertain the validity though i suppose they could be suing him at a different venue than manhattan
technology,not_removed,id think any company with a stake in keeping their products schematics a secret could be up in arms against him that may seem like ill intent but people have every right for their product not to be open source though if they are scamming people on repair costs thats a different story
technology,not_removed,they triedare trying to say that as a result of the code running modern tractors you dont own the tractor you just have an implied license for the lifetime of the vehicle
technology,not_removed,there is an httpwwwcatborgjargonhtmlddontdothatthenhtml that refers to that
technology,not_removed,no the actual video of the repair
technology,not_removed,he has a full conversation without having you talk at all all his videos are like that a lot of introverts like that and it makes it feel like youre conversing with him and theres a bit of a story there so people tune in hes tripped up in this video because of whats going on thats all and obviously thousands of people breathing down your neck because you might have a really shitty problem probably gives you nerves
technology,not_removed,the only videos i watch is where he actually figures stuff out repairing a board there he has one point to get the board working again as someone who has had soldering as a hobby as a kid i love seeing someone like him actually make a living out of it
technology,not_removed,on the tech side though are his videos helpful
technology,not_removed,hes so goddamn long winded and reddit gets their rocks off so hard to it
technology,not_removed,since the lawyer firm appears to specialize in ip i think an ip lawsuit is more likely also friends of him got raided for various reasons not him
technology,not_removed,if i understood everything his shop was closed and raided because of that i didnt make it to the end of the video but i think he was talking about his friends shop being raided
technology,not_removed,in australia anywhere serving alcohol has to offer free drinking water if they do not offer jugs of water you can demand a free bottle of water to my knowledge its illegal to be sent to the bathroom to get a drink as those taps arent classified as drinkable
technology,not_removed,isnt it illegal to refuse a customer free water i would by a drink from her and make sure to not give her any tips ever
technology,not_removed,this is consistent with my experience in miami scumbags everywhere at least in south beach
technology,not_removed,i swear to god this actually happened and im not making it up this exact situation happened to my group of friends we were on our way out but one of us wanted water because it was hot as fuck but the bartender said i need to see the paying customers first dont care how hot it is and he gave in and flashed a bill and said fine and ordered a drink the water he drank the water pocketed the and threw the drink in the guys face i have no idea why the bartender didnt take the first but im guessing hes learned from that mistake lol
technology,not_removed,thats fucked up i like getting fucked up but i also love water and know when i need it
technology,not_removed,and budlights or whatever like at liv
technology,not_removed,stores that refer me to who will have what i need get my business im more likely to go first to them because i know they will help me and if they have what i need theyll get the sale right there
technology,not_removed,yup same here i work in a pretty niche area and pointing people in the right direction providing good customer service in general will get people to come back because usually in my line of work people will want to deal with the nicest guys we arent targeting the lowest common denominator of society so theres that as well
technology,not_removed,whats always forgotten is that making the guy in front of you happy affects the bottom line usually in a postiive way i love places where the staff is willing to bend rules or go out of their way to make me happy
technology,not_removed,i work in car sales and even though im commission i still have a great network in the industry and gladly make suggestions when i cant help them referrals are a major part of a sales persons success so im always trying to find people i can trust who work for other brands and even will send referrals to direct competitors i sent a referral to a friend who works for the same brand as i do because a good customer of mine wanted to help his daughter buy a car but my dealership was too away my friend got an easy deal and took me out to dinner my customer was delighted that i put his daughter in good hands and is even more loyal to me because of it its just good business if someone is looking for a different brand than what i sell i am especially eager to offer a referral because i want that person at toyotalexusbmwwherever to think of me when someone needs a mercedes
technology,not_removed,they damn sure would i never worked in a corporate environment until recently man i hate my fucking life
technology,not_removed,the guys at the top of my company are all about people the somethings that are running the sites thoughtheyre in it for the bucks
technology,not_removed,how do you overheat a phone
technology,not_removed,isnt bad depending on the particular model of iphone i think the is more expensive just for the part from a party oh and thats all apple ever does they replace your entire device
technology,not_removed,as i understand it yes people say this creates a lot of unnecessary ewaste and costs the consumer more than the simple repair would
technology,not_removed,the one on boylston st i ripped my pants open in that store and i wasnt wearing anything under it
technology,not_removed,ill just skip all of boston thanks
technology,not_removed,that guy sounds like an asshole but honestly someone who doesnt know what torx is and cant easily figure it out on their own probably shouldnt be trying to fix their own laptop
technology,not_removed,when i started they werent they narrowed it down quite a bit before i left which made it more difficult to do such things a customer going in there and being somewhat humble and honest made it very easy to plead their case to the ones who could make the call to replace or repair for free after we lost some of the power though i imagine its still the same way telling us youre phone has never been near liquid when the internal sensor is tripped is not going to get you any sympathy telling us your child threw it in the pool would at least score you some bonus compassion points
technology,not_removed,i always viewed those stickers the same way i view not responsible for damage signs in parking lots and such you can say it all you want but it doesnt mean anything if the law disagrees
technology,not_removed,well shit someone should start a class action lawsuit already then
technology,not_removed,this should be up voted far more til
technology,not_removed,of course without government intervention much of this is theoretical manufacturers can get away with their warranty policies because no one ever challenges them on it—its much easier to buy a new phone than spend months in court over a couple hundred bucks a law that is not enforced is not a law
technology,not_removed,good luck fighting that and yes that is what they are counting on
technology,not_removed,the problem is then proving that the repair that a third party company did didnt cause the issue that youre claiming the warranty on the closest i can think of this would be with vehicles and repairs for example i know that some car companies wont honor your warranty if you choose to get oil changes from somewhere other than their dealerships
technology,not_removed,he did say it perfectly but fixing peoples tech is only rewarding if you were born with a sense of empathy or at the very least a sense of sympathy public corporations exist to make shareholders money to be high up on the corporate food chain one needs to have dulled their sense of personal responsibility and empathy really the fastest way to the to top is being able to be completely free of any sense of empathy stepping over others and manipulating your colleagues should cause you no unease hence why sociopaths make great ceos
technology,not_removed,actually legally letting someone work on your macbook does not void the warranty on parts they didnt work on apple appreciates that most people are oblivious of that fact
technology,not_removed,the thing is though is that you can work on your macbook or whatever and lawfully maintain warranty as long it can be proven that x which failed isnt related to y which was modified apple will deny warranty work as they have in the past but no one fights it even when they illegally denied the warranty service assuming the situation explained above to be the case httpmotherboardvicecomreadwarrantyvoidifremovedstickersareillegal
technology,not_removed,quite a few luxury makes will void your warranty if you use third parties for maintenance but will usually look the other way unless the third party maintenance was related to the warranty work youre having done another situation where you arent supposed to use jiffy lube is new bmws with the complimentary maintenance included
technology,not_removed,took my fleet vehicle there for years and my personal car in between major services since and never had a problem at the one location i go to as with all things it depends on the mechanic
technology,not_removed,maybe what youre thinking about is the motor vehicle owners right to repair act googling right to repair federal law brings up car repair laws theres a separate right to repair movement for electronics httpswwwefforgissuesrighttorepair
technology,not_removed,magnusonmoss warranty act see this link httpmotherboardvicecomreadwarrantyvoidifremovedstickersareillegal
technology,not_removed,brighter minds than apples lawyers have tried to answer the ship of theseus problem
technology,not_removed,to some extent apple has a point if you were to replace all the parts of a honda civic with aftermarket parts would it still be a honda civic at what point does a honda civic become not a honda civic if you were to replace each part with aftermarket parts one by one would you be tarnishing the honda brand by driving around in said aftermarket honda civic that did not perform like a honda civic while still displaying the honda civic badge i think cars are a great way to look at this honda has a certified used cars which go through inspections by trained technicians and sold at dealerships if you buy a honda from a noncertified dealer or private person then you could be buying a honda with any imaginable upgrade downgrade or non oem parts i am not sure of the legal intricacies of the apple case but in some other industries this is not an issue
technology,not_removed,i think the main point as to why a law like this is needed is it has always been perfectly legal to do whatever you want with what you purchased those hacks or repairs have never been covered by or attributed to the oem and problems caused by them are never covered by the oem does this make it a nonapple product who cares they have no liability for the machine anymore due to the repairs tarnishing the brand grow the fuck up how many severely modified civics have you seen how about that one that is still running from but its panels are different colors and all the lovely blue smoke coming out the exhaust do people look at that and go wow civics suck no they use common sense the ricer was modified the vehicle is long past its prime and despite being maintained decently probably is just has issues due to age if i owned a mac and had it repaired and it started goofing up afterwards well i blame the repair guy i had do it what tarnishes your brand is releasing an update that bricks devices that were working perfectly fine before hand because you detected a repair was done on the device
technology,not_removed,too damn bad i bought the product i can do what i see fit with it brand be damned if thats what your worried about youd help parties do better work on the other hand any manufacturer has the right to make their devices as hard to repair as they want if you dont like it dont buy it
technology,not_removed,the damaging the brand thing is bs in and of itself if a honda civic is swapped with new parts except the emblem why would it damage the brand even if it made the car much less powerful people arent just in the dark to the fact that parts can be replaced if a civic does not perform like a civic then it is safe to say it is different in some way from a factory new civic and any resulting weirdness is not hondas doing
technology,not_removed,but i bought it it is now mine why does a company have any say in what im doing with my possessions i didnt borrow the laptop i didnt rent it i bought it car manufacturers mostly arent going around throwing lawsuits at speed shops for turining their little econobox into a drag car bmw didnt send me a cease and desist letter for swapping out the suspension with an aftermarket setup for diluting the brand or whatever bs apple is trying
technology,not_removed,ive had the same issue macbook pro with issue after issue new power cordadapter thing new board blah refused to replace the whole unit so i sold the damn thing and built my current pc issues years later faster and best of all not a damned mac
technology,not_removed,what is a lemon
technology,not_removed,think different just like all of us
technology,not_removed,he specifically says hes not being sued in the link which makes the title of this thread false could it just be a cease and desist
technology,not_removed,it isnt but we know you really want to believe hatesheep
technology,not_removed,clicking away at a rapid rate trying to download each and every video so they can upload it to torrents he will be laughing all the way to the bank when he sees how much he makes this month
technology,not_removed,if i understood right the guy is the author not the video maker maybe im just confused
technology,not_removed,he did pretty much imply he wanted his videos downloaded if he gets more of a following hopefully they could put up a good fight
technology,not_removed,a billion dollar company its almost a trillion now so youre off by a lot
technology,not_removed,its crazy and sad to think that a guy only trying to help people fix their own gear which they paid their hardearned money for knew going in that he was playing with fire
technology,not_removed,same for res in safari havent looked yet but pretty sure i lost my saved stuff too in addition to all shortcuts stored at the top love res but also hate res
technology,not_removed,correct thanks for putting me right on this
technology,not_removed,no this is the exact thing copyright exists for to prevent you get to read the book you dont get the text in the book you arent allowed to reprintpublish the text in the book you buy a dvd you dont get the movie you arent allowed to copy the movie and resell it or republish it you get the food you dont get the recipe the whole point of copyright is that chefs can create dishes without people being able to steal their recipes making it financially viable for chefs to invest a lot or money in creating recipes
technology,not_removed,people saying they hate apple and will never use apple products again always strike me as vegans coming into a steak restaurant to loudly exclaim that this place is horrible and they will never eat there
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,louis vid linus vid
technology,not_removed,anyone who thinks more than of apple product owners will care is delusional
technology,not_removed,i havent seen videos from him about anything other than apple products
technology,not_removed,interesting thats a sticky situation when you have tiny low level code which is just part of the product youre using when hardware and software are tied so close its difficult to say what you own and what you dont many modern microwaves have built in software and a simple processor even flashlights with multiple modes likely have nonhardware things involved shoutout to gnulinux and the free as in freedom movement
technology,not_removed,i dont watch most of his videos like this i really like his videos because he is one of the very few people that actually share some of the issues mistakes you can make as well as tips and tricks on doing board repair i cant even learn this shit in school not even university apparently one of the best ee schools in the country thinks that giving you a bread board and telling you how to make shitty basic circuits then cramming hundreds of hours of lecture down your throat will some how teach you how to diagnose and trace a mosfet down on a motherboard with hundreds of other fets on it nor do they thinks its necessary to show you the skill or how to replace a component on some of the scales that some components can use
technology,not_removed,he has a full conversation without having you talk at all you just described radio my grandparents used to listen to the radio no not music all day and they were normal people
technology,not_removed,this is what editing is for
technology,not_removed,in all fairness australia regulates bars quite a bit more than the united states does youd be hard pressed to find anywhere that will measure your shot in the us
technology,not_removed,in australia you can lose your license to sell liquor if you dont have free water obvious and available to patrons its not very safe to deny water to drunk people and its just a shitty thing to do although once a bartender asked me for id before she would give me an empty glass to fill up from the water fountain i just gave it to her but realistically she should feel bad about that
technology,not_removed,its state by state
technology,not_removed,i thought so too but some bar on bourbon street selling bottles for and refusing to fill up a cup with the bar nozzle thing said otherwise
technology,not_removed,and then you wouldnt get served at that bar if they were even moderately busy
technology,not_removed,most bars ive been to even offer free pop if youre the dd because they dont want to be the bar that encouraged drunk driving
technology,not_removed,its all of se florida source proud resident
technology,not_removed,like a colorful lawless swamp
technology,not_removed,dude d wade is not that bad
technology,not_removed,threw the drink in the guys face thats just a dick move regardless of the circumstances
technology,not_removed,i swear to god this actually happened and im not making it up see now i just dont believe you
technology,not_removed,exactly trust is a big factor especially with things like electronics where most consumers dont know much about it ive had best buy reps tell me not to buy the hdmi cable from them i ended up buying a tv probably not because of that but i would trust that i would get accurate information so id choose them given similar prices
technology,not_removed,i gained a ton of respect for my vet when he urged me to find a specialist for gastropexy surgery and this is after hed done very well with two surgeries on the same dog he turned down an surgery because he knew he wasnt experienced enough with it to be that effective instead of just having a go and taking my money that kind of honesty ensured ill keep going to him
technology,not_removed,worked for microsoft for about months and they were terrific but then i also had to work with best buy corporate quit at months
technology,not_removed,part of succeeding in a corporate environment is learning to replace go fuck yourself with ok great
technology,not_removed,its pretty much company policy to replace if it doesnt look neglected try that with xaomi
technology,not_removed,playing an eye candy filled game and charging it at the same time might do it
technology,not_removed,ive left mine out in the sun in summer and had it overheat didnt make that mistake twice
technology,not_removed,i live in texas and my work iphone used to overheat if left in the console of my work truck or my backpack or near any kind of direct sunlight for a good amount of time even if the car ac is on the sunlight through the windshield could overheat it in the gps mount add charging and graphics and it drastically shortens the amount of time it can run in even regular summer temps in the shade
technology,not_removed,its a very good price i work at a third party repair shop and just gettinf a digilcd combo part for a costs us about
technology,not_removed,depends on the repair most often the labor cost of component level troubleshooting and repair exceeds the materials cost of the fru level repair
technology,not_removed,people say this creates a lot of unnecessary ewaste and costs the consumer more than the simple repair would not if youre doing it right in an ideal world the part gets replaced lickety split and then the faulty one is sent to a company that does component level troubleshooting in bulk like everything else its significantly easier to do that if youve got a pile of parts you do all at once instead of doing them piecemeal the fixed parts are then reused as replacement stock or alternatively used to refurbish returned items as necessary the end result is that the customer is out the door fast because their fix is a quick swap and it doesnt cost significantly more than doing a standard component level fix
technology,not_removed,i see this repeated really often but its not true when apple sends a failing logic board it gets sent to a depot where its taken apart and reprioritized per component each board is taken apart the components are individually tested and if they pass theyre added to the parts buckets for remanufactured devices and in some cases the refurbished parts buckets parts that dont pass the tests are discarded i cant think of a cleaner way to do this while producing a smaller amount of ewaste theres a reason that apple consistently wins awards for their components and practices when it comes to reuse and in general being green and waste conscious people on reddit just like to jump on the antiapple train for some reason
technology,not_removed,in western countries cost of labour is so high that often its cheaper to replace the whole component its the same with cars if a garage charges £ and it would need hours to take the old transmission out and put it back in again then hours of work to take it apart and repair then a £ brand new transmission is a better purchase if you live somewhere that charges £ for an hour of labour its better to repair itobviously its the same with phones if you find someone who sits in a little shed somewhere and can get away with charging as little as possible for their timethen suddenly repairing stuff looks good financialy but if youre apple and you have to pay for extremely expensive rent for apple stores and hire people with collage degrees to do simple solderingthen its no wonder that of a screen replacement cost is just labour
technology,not_removed,howd they like them apples
technology,not_removed,the good ol lenny kravitz maneuver
technology,not_removed,if you have to pass route youre too close
technology,not_removed,yeah i if i want my change thrown at me by some hot shot working at radio shack ill give boston a visit one more time
technology,not_removed,you can learn by doing
technology,not_removed,why not whose place is it to tell someone what they should or shouldnt try to do with property they personally bought wholly own you or anyone thinking its a bad idea has zero bearing on what should or shouldnt happen i mean that is kinda the whole bloody point of the argument against apples tactics
technology,not_removed,cant easily figure it out on their own like by asking a genius
technology,not_removed,i think some places are still like that i was helping a woman the other day who said she was taking her phone into the store to have her screen swapped on her way into the store she dropped the damned thing into a puddle the guy helping her gave her the old well it looks like theres something wrong with the battery were going to have to replace it she actually started to protest and said something like oh no i came in for a dead screen his follow up was no the battery is defective wink wink then she figured out what he was doing i am so glad people like that exist in retail stores like this still i do it work and often dig up parts from old failed machines of the same year and model to swap components that apple or other tech companies would otherwise charge them out the ass for i just i really hate this throw away device mentality and it makes me even more angry that companies are quietly trying to get laws passed that stop people from repairing their own stuff its just so unnecessary and wasteful
technology,not_removed,yeah same with those things places like skydiving places make you sign you can make me sign documents and they wont mean a damn thing if i die due to your negligence
technology,not_removed,even software tos are like this i think saying it means nothing is an overstatement but yeah just because you put up a sign or make people sign something doesnt always absolve you unreasonable or obtuse contracts can absolutely be voided especially when one party cant meaningfully negotiate
technology,not_removed,agreed its an uphill battle for someone if they try to bring this up at a shop and are still turned away
technology,not_removed,its exactly this technically they cant void you for opening it but then you take all the blame for anything inside which then voids the warranty
technology,not_removed,you should read snakes in suits it argues that while it does occur from time to time psychopaths have a far from easy time climbing the corporate ladder its very high risk high reward for them
technology,not_removed,i had a jiffy lube fail to put the right rear wheel on correctly and it bent the rim and left me stranded on the nj turnpike however i chalked that up to being in new jersey never had a problem with jiffy lube in va where i live
technology,not_removed,yeah thats all i could think of this with i just cant believe an argument like this made in a court wouldnt be laughed out of court
technology,not_removed,jesus fucking christ the comments on that article drive me insane
technology,not_removed,tell that to john deere
technology,not_removed,former genius people complained to me all the time that their iphone sucked when in reality it was the cheap plastic replacement screen they got installed at a mall kiosk or the untrained tech damaged their speakers during repair you seriously overestimate the tech knowledge and effort of your average consumer
technology,not_removed,but the average person wont know that lets say you buy that car handused and it performs like shit or is unsafe the vast majority of people would blame honda
technology,not_removed,i cant speak to the details of your situation of course but when i was a genius in four repairs for the same issuecomponent would qualify you for a replacement macbook i have to wonder how things ended up that way for you sounds painful for everyone involved
technology,not_removed,after the dead mobo you should have demanded a different product entirely
technology,not_removed,i hate that apple became an evil corporation but ive always had good luck with their macbooks i have a macbook that still works like new
technology,not_removed,something else was going on there bad power supply perhaps no one gets dead motherboards without something else going wrong blame apple for the first dead board but not the next
technology,not_removed,apparently apples law firm just contacted him to tell him that they were fans of the channel im serious
technology,not_removed,could it just be a cease and desist maybe he states he has bits and pieces but is waiting for the full story perhaps a cease and disist but with either minimal details on what activities to cease or what legal basis they have to order him to cease
technology,not_removed,it might be stop what your doing or we will sue you sincerely apples lawyers letter similar to patent trolls where the one being sued will loose a lot of money in litigation unless they do what trolls wants
technology,not_removed,practically speaking thats not much of a distinction its likely he got contacted by lawyers saying stop everything youre doing or well sue you and you cant talk about any of this or well sue you
technology,not_removed,i know for a fact that the fupa isnt large enough to take on apple but the internet is and have the internet in their corner so this might be a shitstorm for the ages
technology,not_removed,imply he wasnt exactly subtle about it not that i disagree with what he wanted to be done but short of giving everyone urls for the software and explicitly telling people to download and share his videos he was really very detailed in his instructions
technology,not_removed,makes you kind of think about it means to actually own something like technology
technology,not_removed,yes but in this case the possibilities exist that the schematics are leaked or stolen which doesnt seem too legal to me
technology,not_removed,recipes are not protected by copyright you can teach and make it however you can you just cant call it cocacola
technology,not_removed,agreed this was my experience as well however and maybe this was just me but i was in the program to learn the engineering aspect which i feel like i got not the repair side related but definitely different
technology,not_removed,graduated in ee from a good ee schoolcan confirm
technology,not_removed,electronics repair is something you learn at a community college or in the military i certainly would not expect it to be taught in an ee program
technology,not_removed,you dont measure shots in the us i work in a pub in the uk and by law a shot here is we have little steel shot measures that we are required to use too seems just bizarre to me to not
technology,not_removed,ive tended bar in places where measuring shots was requiredby the stingy owners not the law
technology,not_removed,measuring shots i just watch as the bartender grabs a handful of bottles and just pours them into a cup a few additives and some shaking later my drink is there
technology,not_removed,new york here any place that sells food or beverages is required to provide free water even if its just from the tap edit for the record i live about hours away from the city
technology,not_removed,i think california was like that too
technology,not_removed,meanwhile in florida
technology,not_removed,the solution is to leave florida or simply never go there in the first place
technology,not_removed,it is however illegal to deny water to anyone in arizona where water must be provided at no charge if requested nope that is an urban legend
technology,not_removed,yeah that is pretty bullshit honestly free water from a business that sells liquor or food should be mandatory
technology,not_removed,might have been a business rule all patrons must be ided for all sales or she was tired and just ided you on habit
technology,not_removed,eh i have been a bartender before the bartender can be a cunt all they want but its really up to the managers whether or not you get served and if youre buying full priced drinks they could give a shit if youre not getting tipped from one guy
technology,not_removed,there are a few good places that wont do that i used to spend a lot of time at abbeys brewing company ive been at the sober up time scarfing on fries and chicken nuggets from the mcdonalds next door and theyve always given me free water if youre in one if the night clubs however youre fucked they dont give a shit about you all
technology,not_removed,not just a dick move but assault the same as sucker punching someone
technology,not_removed,i told the story on reddit once before but i deleted it after i got karma and someone responded with rthathappened
technology,not_removed,but the tv doesnt have high profit margins youre fired
technology,not_removed,ms is weird corporate but mildly openfriendly even i dont know any other way to describe it than lawful neutral
technology,not_removed,i have worked for multiple corporate companies all with it in various industries and now consult many corporate companies for it working for a large corporate consulting firm i have become jaded to belief i people actually caring for their fellow man it is also about the cheapest way to make the most money many corporate companies treat their employees well while they are fucking their customers three times sideways people blame millenials and the silent generations for this and that but the baby boomer and gen x are some of the most ruthless sociopaths i have ever met the companies run by the silent generation and millenials care the others the will outweigh selling cars knowing will explode and kill someone if the fine is less than the profit of the cars
technology,not_removed,ya i couldnt do that at my last job i couldnt hold back my scathing unadulterated hatred of half the team so i never communicated eventually fired still no regrets fuck those people in levensworth uk eat your brexit vote and choke insert maniacal laughter here
technology,not_removed,hr informed me the actual substitute for go fuck yourself is good for you with lots of condescending tone and a fake smile
technology,not_removed,while your phone is searching for bluetooth wifi and gps signals in an underground parking garage
technology,not_removed,i cant remember the price for the or because we get so few in but where i work the repair is and the repair is
technology,not_removed,nearly every consumer electronics company handles repairs in this way its almost always cheaper for them to have a low level tech install a new board than it is to pay a highly trained professional to do component level troubleshooting and repair
technology,not_removed,regardless of expense customer satisfaction is probably the priority they dont want to replace a blown cap on the motherboard for dollars of labor and ¢ in parts if theres a chance of it failing the second time the macbook loses its magic smoke the customer is going to be rationally upset its probably better for word of mouth and pr for their customers to experience one expensive repair then multiple cheap repairs it makes it feel like a oneoff defect as opposed to a stream of faulty manufacturing and service
technology,not_removed,i tend to think its more because official shops from apple and that sake any company arent equipped to do repairs on such level they are there to get faulty products in and then elsewhere they just replace the whole mobo because anyway the consumer pays to get on a level like the small repair shop requires actually skilled people who can bother understanding the electronics on a deeper level to figure out what component is broken and also need to have sufficient hardware stored to take away the broken parts i can understand why big corps dont want to go through that lane but that should be a choice for me as a consumer who actually owns the hardware and not apple and the likes to dictate me i cant ask someone else to fix my hardware
technology,not_removed,louis seems to be able to do it and still turn a profit
technology,not_removed,im a chubby man with a small penus
technology,not_removed,well how do you like dem apples
technology,not_removed,how else am i supposed to get to evergrande city and become the pokemon champion
technology,not_removed,i agree no matter what the costmarkupwhatever if you bought something you should own it and be able to repairhackmodifyreverse engineerrepurposeetc to your hearts content the company doesnt have to help you but they shouldnt be allowed to stop you
technology,not_removed,right but you cant expect apple employees to actually recommend you do this or help you buy the products to do something apple doesnt recommend they dont build their computers to be serviced by customers they arent really going to help you do that
technology,not_removed,youre free to repair your own apple products but apple wont tell you how and all your warranties are voided thats the catch
technology,not_removed,yeah i whole heartedly agree id never tell them they cant just recommend they make sure they know what theyre doing first this guy should be able to do whatever he wants with it but its my opinion that if he doesnt even know what a torx driver is he probably isnt ready to attempt a repair on his own and runs a high risk of regretting doing so really i think specialty screws are a pretty reasonable way to say hey be careful you could potentially fuck something up if you go past this point not that theyre always needed for that where theyre used but it can serve to make someone at least slow down a little and do a google search before they just tear into something no reason for the apple employee in this story to be a dick about it though
technology,not_removed,i actually have asked people with cracked screens if they have their phones backed up and if they did i would just drop it on the cement floor and say oh man im sorry and just told my boss i dropped it and it was my fault the screen was broken
technology,not_removed,dont read them they raise blood pressure
technology,not_removed,i doubt that most would blame the seller there doesnt need to be a system protecting from idiots who blame the manufacturer for a used cars problems
technology,not_removed,they have to otherwise youre given a default judgment against them you just have to make sure you properly serve them
technology,not_removed,i bet they did an out of court settlement with their highly paid lawyers it might not have been worth the time over this amount
technology,not_removed,apple policy is major failures and they give you a brand new laptop something isnt adding up here also fucking boards other than gpu defects mac laptop logic board failures are of the time physical damage like liquid or dropping or whatever moreover if you have one of the macbook pros with the shitty ati flipchip gpus that fail they will still replace it for free until the end of
technology,not_removed,idk i think theres a lot more to this and the information is too ambiguous for people to get the pitchforks out i mean as of the last time i checked his channel was still up wouldnt it have already gotten shut down
technology,not_removed,doubt it this will probably blow over in a few months tops
technology,not_removed,what is fupa the only fupa that i have heard of is fat upper pussy area
technology,not_removed,if made a video like hey were in a legal battle with apple for some bullshit theyre tryna pull i think the internet would find a way to keep them funded
technology,not_removed,that has to be the lamest thing i ever read
technology,not_removed,a lot most of restaurants in the us that serve alcohol do measure shots but that is because of the restaurants rules not the states bars on the other hand make more money when the bartender doesnt measure so they generally dont care unless there is a major liqueur shortage when inventory is done
technology,not_removed,isnt that called a jigger
technology,not_removed,more and more hospitality service points are using the automated shot dispensercollars for efficiency accuracy and loss prevention
technology,not_removed,no way my favorite bars are the ones that have heavy pours sometimes double shots in cocktails if they really like you
technology,not_removed,you can get things on the bottles that only pour shots worth at a time
technology,not_removed,yes i will be back shortly with your toi i mean tap water sir
technology,not_removed,there is a company that bottles and sell nyc tapwater so it cant be that bad i guess
technology,not_removed,californian here ive never been denied a water cup anywhere although working in a restaurant for years it never came up as a law just a shitty thing to not give someone
technology,not_removed,it is in a lot of the civilised world
technology,not_removed,yep its disgusting behaviour and completely unwarranted yes the bartender was being a dick the correct response in that situation is to vote with your wallet and go drink somewhere else and maybe complain to his manager not attack the guy
technology,not_removed,it all depends on your gig and the team you land on
technology,not_removed,funny short story i applied for a store manage of one if their retail stores went through a few phone interviews and in person interview as well they really liked me went to a final in person interview and at the end they told me i wasnt getting the job i had the experience and everything i was qualified for it they wanted me for the job i managed multiple cell phone stores i had a fantastic record in successful stores over years managing employees i came to realize that the most important thing is employee happiness and thats what always brought me success my employees were mostly happy all the time and they all loved me and all my stores broke their own records in sales month after month thats what i used mostly for my interviews going back to the interview they told me they did not care about the retail employees happiness thats why i wasnt getting the job
technology,not_removed,it is also about the cheapest way to make the most money i wish corporate is generally all about individuals covering their own ass even at the expense of profit seeking or common sense
technology,not_removed,the art of diplomacy is telling someone to go to hell in a manner that theyll be so a happy to go they will ask you for directions
technology,not_removed,charging the phone while listening to music in bed and then the phone getting under the blankets
technology,not_removed,its also more reliable to replace the whole board if someone tries to repair a small component and messes up you either piss off the customer by not fixing it again or bite the bullet and then replace the whole thing
technology,not_removed,i service and repair pioneer cdjs a mixers and they are just the same with regards to parts no service center actually repairs boards and they just replace with new i asked one of the parts dealers if i can send anything back to pioneer as i have no use for them and they just said no and to dispose of them in the correct way
technology,not_removed,this is the correct answer troubleshooting component level defects for consumer electronics is a waste of time you need to find more than the blown part to do it correctly you need to find the root cause so the blown part doesnt reblow out as you said your blown capacitor could be due to a short somewhere downstream that is drawing slightly more current than its designed to handle and will cause the cap to die in oh hours to try to figure that out is a complete and utter waste of time
technology,not_removed,and also its much better experience when a customer walks into an apple store with a broken iphone and leaves with a brand new one in minutes if you have any other brand you most likely send it somewhere for weeks only to hear back that they wont fix it under warranty or that the repair is more expensive than a new phone
technology,not_removed,because he has schematics and is trained to use the tools imagine if we treated electronic tech repair like we do car repair
technology,not_removed,louis literally says he wants to find a replacement and cant at the wage he can provide that tells me that board level repair might not be a worthwhile field
technology,not_removed,sup boi ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
technology,not_removed,how else am i supposed to find my son and protect various settlements that need my help
technology,not_removed,your warranty should be voided if you do anything to alter the machine
technology,not_removed,properly serving them is key in small claims had the experience of going to court and thr judge dismissed the case cause i couldnt prove they got the papers
technology,not_removed,how did you serve them
technology,not_removed,idk didnt the public stay interested in the iphone fbi unlock case for like what five weeks or so thats eons in internet land
technology,not_removed,youtuber ethan klein is all about the fupa that youre referencing but when he was sued for fair use the internet rallied and donated more than enough to fight the case the remaining money was set aside in an account that has the oh so beautiful name of the fair use protection account money that can be used to protect fair use of youtubers
technology,not_removed,fair use protection account put together from donations received by even they realized what it sounded like
technology,not_removed,not much is better than a or double shot at a single shot price other than free booze of course
technology,not_removed,dont know if theyre called that here we just call them either measures or littlesilvershotthingies but then again my work isnt a fancy bar or nothing just a pub
technology,not_removed,they wanted to refuse you so you gotta take their toilet paper
technology,not_removed,youre thinking of
technology,not_removed,hows the windows upgrade notification team
technology,not_removed,wow thats surprising its well known in trainingcoaching that if you take care of your people they almost always take care of you and you get better results i could not possibly imagine not having a fun work environment with unhappy employees that shit would suck
technology,not_removed,allow me to preface with the fact that i dont mean this offensively but merely my perspective as someone who has been on a panel to hire someone like yourself i wouldnt hire you either because you make it clear its about you and what you did and how they loved you and because of them loving you they performed well not that you hired good talent that you placed this talent in critical roles that allowed them to use their skills and develop you making them happy made them work hard and success followed this isnt managing its daycare edit some words missing edit im just some dude with an opinion nothing else i am sure there would folks who love the approach mentioned above im not one of them edit people arent understanding the point that when i read his post above it comes off as very selfish a me me me attitude praising himself as the reason for the success rather than the team and his employees to me that isnt ideal management and would rather hire a person that understands how important their employees are to their success a great manager will always know exactly why they succeeded and its usually from hiring good people placing these people in roles that they will succeed in supporting his people and allowing them to get the work done their way and then reaping the rewards the idea that his people loved him and thats why they kicked ass isnt good management
technology,not_removed,you seem to possess some narcissistic qualities count the number of times you referred to yourself in your comment think about how you only see how things affect you how you were brought success your employees were happy and loved you your stores
technology,not_removed,that seems like a pretty ass backwards mentality when considering a customerfacing retail sales environment how do they honestly think low morale equates to a positive customer service experience and repeat sales numberblind corporate idiocy at its finest
technology,not_removed,the hubris is real with this one
technology,not_removed,for those cold and lonely nights
technology,not_removed,also and this is the reason why hes being sued in order to perform these fixes hes pirated both schematics and some applespecific software if hed bought those things legitimately from apple hed still be digging his company out of the hole
technology,not_removed,for the knowledge and expertise required to do this hes probably be better off working for a defense contractor or a medical devices company doing the same thing instead of working on a laptop hes working on a piece of equipment where it being down for a day is costing whomever is using it more than a day
technology,not_removed,these arent the droids were looking for move along move along
technology,not_removed,thankfully where i live the court serves small claims suits for you
technology,not_removed,so yeah a few months tops
technology,not_removed,thats different because it was linked to a shooting and those are sadly more popular the only reason this is making noise is because hes earned reddits interest as well as a lot of the internet its interesting and empowering what he does and apple is taking one this one little guy because they can the san bernardino shooting didnt affect one little guy on the internet if this guy didnt get popular on youtube or as popular as he has now nobody would care and it would probably be front page but just one post all hush hush popularity depends on both interest and involvement whenever this happens i will be far less interested than the fbi phone cracking it simply affects less people and is less interesting to nontech internet users
technology,not_removed,be careful about free booze it always come with attachments come on over i got free beer while youre here can you help me move a piano
technology,not_removed,in florida ny style pizza places will advertise that they ship in ny water for their dough cant say i can tell a difference but its a thing
technology,not_removed,ehhhh
technology,not_removed,which they get from upstate ny
technology,not_removed,windows upgrade notification team we were supposed to be the notification team shit weve been doing this all wrong
technology,not_removed,id imagine theyre fairly busy making sure everyone upgrades regardless of desire or intent
technology,not_removed,they are the borg no feelings just upgrade pls
technology,not_removed,well they were trying to sell the microsoft phones no fun to be had
technology,not_removed,i still dont understand your reasoning all that should matter is that he was able to consistently break sales records why should it matter because he was able to do it through positive management instead of your approach it seems like both approaches get results plus as one of the peons who isnt in management the power of a good boss is just incredible and what you call daycare i would call a positive work environment that gets the most productive work out of its workers a boss that people do not like just slows down everything in all kinds of ways
technology,not_removed,that and the fact that he is probably full of shit
technology,not_removed,i would understand that if you are managing groceries or just paper pushing but in it for example without getting the right people you are doomed i have no idea what the train of thought is there
technology,not_removed,what is wrong with daycare as long as its sustainable and produces results im not trying to say your preferred method of management is literally hitler or anything but micromanaging is the fastest way to lose engagement the above method doesnt stop with making people happy you still teach coach and train and hold people accountable it leaves you open to getting taken advantage of so you need to establish an understanding that under performers will be dealt with when you achieve that zen like level enjoy it and sustain it as long as possible
technology,not_removed,so define good managing then
technology,not_removed,he said he increased metrics he would have not been happy joining apple after realizing they dont care about employees like sears too managers have to fire cashiers for not signing up people for spam i wouldnt ever do it and i would get fired not a good fit for me
technology,not_removed,i like how you extrapolate from a tiny response and have the dude completely figured out i wouldnt hire you you quick judging schmo
technology,not_removed,to be fair when interviewing you do have to emphasize what you did yourself and your own personal impact for interviews i had to break the habit of defaulting to saying we when describing past accomplishments and remember to emphasize my role you are selling yourself in an interview it might feel more selfpromoting than youre used to but the interviewer wants to understand clearly what you did
technology,not_removed,typically you can pay a fee for the sheriffs office to serve the papers there are also private companies that serve official papers as well source recently went through a divorce and had private company serve
technology,not_removed,they actually ship in powdered ny water to rehydrate it you just add water
technology,not_removed,thats because florida tap water smells like burnt matches its terrible wtf are you guys doing
technology,not_removed,they finally added a decline upgrade button to the pop up theyre figuring it out
technology,not_removed,jupiters cock
technology,not_removed,lol dont know why this was downvoted thats hilarious
technology,not_removed,no a manager who can only point to employee morale as a benefit is like saying im a good husband because my wife is happy a very important metric but what if we live in dire straits kids are sick etc because i cant hold a job but my wifes happy youre not likely to believe me even if she is happy doesnt mean everything is kosher you have no quantifiable data employee morale was up because we met our deadlines of the time reducing the stress of excessive overtime is a much better way to point out the employee happiness btw not saying the commenter was bad just that in an interview you usually add more quantifiable data
technology,not_removed,we are doing the sheriff route now because a bunch of dentists decided to not pay us dental labs
technology,not_removed,windows is the latest release of microsoft with plenty of gui features due to which it has a large number of users who all are currently using this windows while upgrading their current windows os to windows many users reported about the horrible error blue screen of death on
technology,not_removed,a future device may or may not omit one button whoa major news
technology,not_removed,apples design decisions seem to be worse and worse as time goes on im finding the user experience to be worse and worse on each update whether the hardware or os with the touch screen problems they have been having not having a physical button doesnt seem ideal right now
technology,not_removed,how innovative

technology,not_removed,but would you buy one d
technology,not_removed,yes for review i definitely buy one
technology,not_removed,i see i would also love to get my hands on it when it hits the philippines d
technology,not_removed,and commercial nuclear fusion power plants too s
technology,not_removed,the cost of solar panels has fallen by per cent in seven years with battery costs dropping by per cent over a similar period i think ill be ready in years to buy property and i definitely think ill make a large investment in solar for it i wish my area had more annual peak sun hours but whatever
technology,not_removed,im all for it but do you know how many times i have seen predictions for peak oil they always tend to be a bit optimistic we have a huge worldwide economy that is based on the consumption of fossil fuels there is a lot of inertia in that system it will take time to turn it around i believe that it will happen i think that it is inevitable but happy slappy estimates like this just end up making people disappointed
technology,not_removed,and the fear from the fossil fuel puppets is so bad theyre making solar illegal in some cities
technology,not_removed,cmon you know thats years away im betting on zero point energy perpetual motion technology
technology,not_removed,in certain ways we have passed peak oil particularly in quality and easy locations fracking locations are easy to use but the quality is low and new sweet light crude oil can only be found further out in the oceans one side issue the iraqi oil fields once considered some of the highest quality was tainted heavily by bad production practices during the gas and cars were a replacement for horses and their pollution so we can do it again
technology,not_removed,and we will im just saying that it will take some time to turn around when the industrial revolution took place there were about of a billion people on the planet there are over billion now it is a big machine that runs on fossil fuel it wont turn on a dime
technology,not_removed,mucho agree just had that minor caveat of cheap poor quality oil for some reason the analogy of watching an oil tanker turning in even slower motion seems appropriate around the dime in question but we are finally starting to turn
technology,not_removed,blame john connor
technology,not_removed,so does this mean the prince of nigeria will have to wait to send his emails requesting help for moving his wealth around banks
technology,not_removed,or lester crest
technology,not_removed,this story is from april last year the company is now called safr previously safeher and they still havent launched apparently due to high demand strikes me as basic marketing crapola tbh announce false date or have low manufacturing volumes etc claim victory when you fail to deliver due to unexpected demand
technology,not_removed,is this like straight from bojack horseman
technology,not_removed,i dont see how this is remotely legal
technology,not_removed,how does this handle if a couple want to get a ride somewhere
technology,not_removed,well that name certainly isnt going to shape attitudes and stereotypes or anything s
technology,not_removed,it sounds like the high demand is mostly in social media terms not in actual dollar terms or people would be falling over each other to fill this gap and earn that money it is also very much illegal any argument that could be made about feeling safer with drivers and customers of a certain gender could just as easily be used by a hypothetical whiterdr ride sharing app that exclusively paired caucasian customers with caucasian drivers not to mention the fallout when the first transgender customer or driver wants join their app and their support fragments into the transinclusive and transexclsuive camps of feminism the main problem however that i can see has nothing to do with gender but simply with the fact that uber and similar programs live and die by their popularity and size there is no room for niche players if they cant get enough drivers customers will avoid them and if they can get enough customers not enough drivers will join the program unless they have enough capital to do a major marketing push with articles like this one and to pay drivers for the transition time when it is not quite profitable yet they wont be able to establish themselves
technology,not_removed,overwhelming demand in certain editorial pages i guess it isnt going to work few enough women want the miserable working conditions of the unlicensed taxi ridesharing industry and those who have to work there anyway dont want to prematurely exclude half their customer base optimistically speaking
technology,not_removed,like safeher sherides was marketed as exclusively for and driven by women come this summer however that will no longer be the case—men will be able to both drive and ride in their ridesharing service the change comes after the owners of sherides faced steep legal fees after activists and male drivers threatened to sue according to arkansas online safeher is already facing similar criticism that it may be illegal according to the boston globe civil rights lawyers say that the new service would likely conflict with massachusetts antidiscrimation laws
technology,not_removed,next up whites only ride sharing and then jews only
technology,not_removed,what about antidiscrimination laws this is not only discrimates males it very likely also discriminates transsexualstransvestites because its not clear exactly how they define woman biological gender legal gender
technology,not_removed,so its basically a guaranteed lump sum of money for the first person to launch legal action against them for discrimination many people have spent their lives fighting for gender equality and against segregation we cannot let their sacrifice be in vain by allowing such blatant discrimination to occur
technology,not_removed,so you have to identify as a female to get a ride as a male meh i suppose thats not so bad
technology,not_removed,wed love to go in front of the supreme court and actually try and change some laws because there is such a need for that this is foolish he wants to change the law to allow discrimination against male drivers and passengers because a male passenger was drunk and unruly and that made him worried about his wifes safety how is this any different from a racist store owner saying blacks arent welcome because they steal a lot is there a difference
technology,not_removed,yep go right ahead all men are shit right were all awful we want to rape you and beat you up all of you women keep thinking that and stay away from me while youre doing it i would prefer the paranoid idiots living in an echo chamber stay away
technology,not_removed,what happends when a man puts on a wig and say he identify as female if this is legal im starting a online wig store
technology,not_removed,sounds like theyre just tired of getting hit on by uber drivers its pretty understandable this literally has no affect on your life theres no reason for you guys to be mad about it
technology,not_removed,with how dangerous black people are maybe we should make a white only share ride system too s
technology,not_removed,wheres my all male ride sharing app no women to judge me as a potential rapist and lower my self esteem same people who advocate for the all female ride sharing app would be outraged hearing me say that
technology,not_removed,and so the war on males begins
technology,not_removed,ah the feminiazis strike again
technology,not_removed,something about muslim men not being able to control themselves around women and a comparison here is that what this is saying
technology,not_removed,i dont understand all the anger from you people in what way could this possibly effect your life ill tell you it wont you are not excluded from ride sharing services there are plenty out there it makes sense for one to cater to females only do you people really think they are doing this out of malice or to shit on men lmao you people need to get out and try speaking with real women for once there are many instances of sexural harassment by drivers and if a customer base wants a female driver to just drive around females and if that makes them feel saferbetter then more power to them it will effect me in no way and im mature enough to not see everything as an us vs them mentality its just a simple solution to a problem people are having if men start getting hit on and harassed by female uber drivers to the point where they feel safer with an all men one then go for it god damn this site if full of petty year olds who spend way to much of their life focusing on shit that has no effect on them
technology,not_removed,i am all for ending discrimination laws people should be able to discriminate based on any criteria they want outside of the government the reason the government cant discriminate is because it is mandatory
technology,not_removed,still havent launched apparently due to high demand how does that stop you from launching high demand just means you can launch for a higher price
technology,not_removed,cabracadabra
technology,not_removed,nah i remember hearing about this a couple of years ago far before the newest bojack season not sure if they copied that or just happened upon the same idea but safeher was before cabracadabra that being said which one has the dumber name is still open for discussion
technology,not_removed,my first thoughts too
technology,not_removed,however mr pelletz told the observer that his legal team hasnt faced any challenges yet hopefully we wont but if we do wed love to go in front of the supreme court and actually try and change some laws because there is such a need for that sounds like they want to remove anti discrimination laws
technology,not_removed,yes they should follow the lead of uber and make sure to comply with all laws and regulations
technology,not_removed,somehow hooters hiring practices remain legal i have no idea how
technology,not_removed,women only gyms women only apartments workplaces study spaces on college campuses etc etc i dont think anyone cares enough to take it to court
technology,not_removed,well is this just about an app or is this a business if its the former i dont see how it could be illegal though if its the latter i definitely see legal problems
technology,not_removed,dont worry its not going to work most women dont want to be cab drivers when they fail theyre going to cry oppression again
technology,not_removed,how would this be illegal
technology,not_removed,they might be able to get around the issue by offering a maleonly service in conjunction so your driver matches your gender or should they do it by sex oh boy aside from that it would be an interesting test case under the first amendments freedom of association if they go that route
technology,not_removed,do you not think women will be safer statistically if they are allowed to choose to be with other women strangers than men strangers inside cars
technology,not_removed,theyre not allowed to no men over
technology,not_removed,the guy gets in the trunk
technology,not_removed,clearly you dont understand just how overwhelmed they are s
technology,not_removed,blacks have to ride in the back why cause im black i have to ride one the back no sir my front passenger seat is full with my backpack and urine container
technology,not_removed,just to let you know transvestites are people who enjoy wearing the clothing of the opposite gender but do not identify as the opposite gender to their sex
technology,not_removed,i find it unlikely that youd win that case protected groups have been allowed to keep to themselves in many ways usually for safety or the feeling of safety i do wonder how it would go if a transwoman or bi gendered person tried to sign up though they might have a better chance in court if denied
technology,not_removed,while its technically discrimination i really fail to see how its a big deal for anyone in a negative way
technology,not_removed,aa a trans woman this whole premise confuses me if females are allowed then arent trans men allowed
technology,not_removed,devils advocate i believe the standard argument is to say there is no comparison because they are not the exact literal same scenarios
technology,not_removed,begins it has been going on for some time
technology,not_removed,quit the hysterics
technology,not_removed,yeah its never been so hard to be a man pretty soon you wont be able to get your own bank account or vote
technology,not_removed,dont be such an altright why cant businesses deny service to a particular gender youre surrounded by your male privilege look at how many options you have women have none
technology,not_removed,the law has consistently held that separate but equal is illegal in almost every practical circumstance we have spent a long time as a nation working against discrimination and continue to do so lets not take a step backward
technology,not_removed,just thinking this through though the problem with shit like this is that society does not want discrimination of sex religion race etc everyone is supposed to be treated equally woman are continually requesting this but then push for segregated services now i dont know if woman actually want these things i mainly see segregated services created by men for woman people are also worried about a cascade effect the us has a horrible record for taking concepts to solve one actual issue and extending it to everything because do i really care about some ride sharing app that will fail before launch no but i dont want to see the world move back to segregation of anything and supporting these sorts of small things can grow to bigger things especially these days were ridiculous concepts ideas and services get funding and blown up on a large scale we live in a time where we cant ignore small things like this because before we know it it could be huge and changing things
technology,not_removed,well if this is going to be anything like uber theyre not going to charge users for the service with a product yeah you can just price gate whatever youre selling to cut down on volume until youre able to afford said volume with a freetouse service it is a bit harder since you need to have infrastructure setup to handle the influx of trafficbusiness
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,right but only in the direction that they want no chance that will get abused s
technology,not_removed,im excited for the post in two weeks about them shutting down lol
technology,not_removed,i bet the people who made this app agree with the verdict jack phillips received edit
technology,not_removed,women are a majority group
technology,not_removed,couldnt they avoid legal trouble by simply making a ride share app that lets you choose your gender preference for your driver or something
technology,not_removed,there were two other services before them and all got sued and had to allow male drivers
technology,not_removed,sarcasm because uber actively avoids following the law whenever they feel like it
technology,not_removed,i think theyre considered to be entertainers
technology,not_removed,i believe its because hooters waitresses are classed as models not waitresses its how theye allowed to discriminate based on looks
technology,not_removed,womenonly mens locker rooms wait
technology,not_removed,i think with how big of an issue transgender rights have become all that shit is about to get shut down
technology,not_removed,not sure why youre being downvoted this service already folded due to lack of female drivers
technology,not_removed,potential title vii violation they need to prove that being a woman is a bonafide occupational qualification for their driving service and that a similarly qualified man would not cause issues in performing the work current case law is that customer preference or customers feeling of safety are not sufficient qualification for a bfoq limiting who they serve is legal as far as i know but people love getting outraged at people who refuse service to gays and this is the same thing against a federally protected class so shrugs
technology,not_removed,can we get an allwhite ridesharing app as well then we are statistically safer if we are allowed to be with other white strangers than black strangers inside cars
technology,not_removed,i dont know how thats relevant its still not legal to discriminate on the basis of gender
technology,not_removed,men are of the victims of stranger violence and almost all crimes involving car services are committed against the drivers not the passengers
technology,not_removed,only on reddit will the simple thought of doing something that helps a women feel more comfortable result in massive downvotes
technology,not_removed,maybe theyll give him a helmet and attach a street luge to the back of the car with a bungee strap
technology,not_removed,they just tie him to the back of the car and drag him to the destination
technology,not_removed,nah he just has to pull the rickshaw
technology,not_removed,i knew that but what if one of them lets assume he is male wants to work for such taxi service will he be allowed allowed but only in womans clothes which will ok with him
technology,not_removed,an ocean is made of tiny drops and when the tiny drops are enough to cover your mouth you wont be able to shout against them no more
technology,not_removed,it normalizes the idea that men are objectionable in some way compare to starting a whitr company that is whites only
technology,not_removed,and where do apache helicopters stand in all of this
technology,not_removed,rshitredditsays is that way
technology,not_removed,bojack horseman season episode old acquaintance discusses the difficulties unattractive lady drivers face on todd and mr peanutbutters rideshare startup cabracadabra in people blogs views since aug ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
technology,not_removed,they arent looking at numbers though
technology,not_removed,no that would be sexist s
technology,not_removed,you can get ahold of any of the mens groups out there trying to fight for mens rights or abuse of men they will tell you pretty bluntly that todays feminism is not about equality at all its about women being superior hell a huge group of feminists protested at a meeting for men whop were sexually abused not too long ago pretty outright horrible people
technology,not_removed,because these big polemic things are what gives clicks they make people read the news and talk about it
technology,not_removed,between the pay cut and fee increases they might i remember reading about how it wasnt worth being a driver before the cuts dont uber drivers make less than they did in
technology,not_removed,i think trump could end up being a disaster president but boy that media meltdown on election night was wonderful but then they quickly used the popular vote as an excuse not to talk about why they lost
technology,not_removed,lol sexist stereotypes work but really its more statistics if there were a lot of female drivers there would already have been before this service ever happened there just arent many female cab drivers
technology,not_removed,no most of them just dont like it because of their woman personality
technology,not_removed,is it legal im not american but i thought you guys had some sort of little issue with whitesonly fountains and whatnot unless its another case of you cant discriminate against white males dummy
technology,not_removed,all asian jew sign me up
technology,not_removed,i can easily point you to news where uber drivers have raped women can you do the same for black uber drivers perpetuating crimes against white passengers i dont think you can
technology,not_removed,are you sure about that last i checked era hadnt passed
technology,not_removed,im sure the demand for this service is based in the fact that woman feel less safe around strange men than other men do knowing the statistics doesnt change that
technology,not_removed,women are the victims of rape by uber drivers
technology,not_removed,does it really matter people will go into the bathroom that they feel more comfortable in of the world goes into the bathroom to actually use the bathroom and not to commit sexual assault
technology,not_removed,no real way except by asking genitals check will not help because there are preopnoop transsexuals who still identify themselves as such
technology,not_removed,well probably not as he identifies as male if this hypothetical person identified as female and took steps to present as such then i cant see why that person wouldnt be allowed
technology,not_removed,which way
technology,not_removed,i lost a best friend because his new girlfriend is a feminist and she wont be friends with me and our friends because it is a alpha male dominated group as in we do lots of camping fishing sports etc
technology,not_removed,i mean there wouldnt be articles reporting on feminists doing hateful shit if feminists werent constantly doing hateful shit and it feels like if the opposite was happening thered be an endless amount of twitter outrage from equal rights minded people complaining about how an allmale uber service is symptom of a maledominated society that isnt inclusive towards women or some bullshit and you better believe they would be forced to stop but where are all the supposed real feminists speaking up about this all i hear is silence
technology,not_removed,but he won the popular vote how would have that been a talking point the only leg theyve been standing on is about them getting caught cheating bernie out of the election hilary is just freaking the fuck out because she had years of favors built up in the white house and now shell die before she gets to use them
technology,not_removed,lol sexist stereotypes work i never said they did but when this was posted the business had already failed to launch and there have been two other services just like this in the past that also failed for the exact same reason so i dont think its a stereotype nor is it sexist its a reasonable prediction about the availability of willing employees in a given industry similarly a female only construction company folded a few years ago because they couldnt staff the business properly with only women this should have been obvious but the kinds of people who start these companies tend to be under the impression that the reason women dont work in these fields is because of discrimination and they forget that men and women often make different choices in terms of lifestyle and employment
technology,not_removed,stuff like that was why the civil rights act of was made of which title vii is part of it edit referring to the second part its a bit more iffy on who you can deny service to drinking fountains are a public accommodation and thus cant be segregated private businesses are more complicated
technology,not_removed,only asian jews your driver will arrive in three and a half hours
technology,not_removed,all asian silly dylan thats not how the stereotype goes
technology,not_removed,then we have a perception problem not a transportation problem and youre right there is actual data that shows women have greater fear for their safety in public than men do its not a justified fear but it exists problem is that services like this use that fear as does the media and activists in order to push an agenda thats not based on fact or reason instead of catering to an irrational fear we should deal with this irrational fear
technology,not_removed,women are safer with other women than with men that is more than a feeling why is that not important to you
technology,not_removed,the problem with this is they tend to use the excuse well i did not do that they dont stand for us each time this has been done an issue is there is no feminist organisation that actually exists just a movement so anytime someone does something that can be turned on them they disown that person and carry on with their hatred religion does this often too
technology,not_removed,i mean there wouldnt be articles reporting on feminists doing hateful shit if feminists werent constantly doing hateful shit extremism is on any movement they are used as examples to padronize the entire movement and this doesnt apply just to feminism and it feels like if the opposite was happening thered be an endless amount of twitter outrage from equal rights minded people complaining about how an allmale uber service is symptom of a maledominated society that isnt inclusive towards women the same crowd that would applaud a womenonly app are the ones who would criticize a maleonly app on twitter its the same public we are talking about here but where are all the supposed real feminists speaking up about this all i hear is silence
technology,not_removed,taxis struggle because of exploitative regulation and because the model and practices of most taxi companies is seriously outdated and being outcompeted there is no reason in practical terms that taxis cant compete on price if the badgemedallion system is done away with theyd just need to stop having shitty service and comfort and improve their dispatching system there is lots of ground between uber and traditional taxis and somewhere in the middle is fair prices and more equitable wages and benefits
technology,not_removed,when trump won the left quickly rallied behind the idea that hilary won the popular vote i just feel that this ended up preventing people on the left from addressing why they lost why they lost breaks down into a few major sections hilary was a flawed candidate bernie emails etc the left is alienating middle and leftist people with very hardline far left genderrace politics lack of democrat support is what defined the election results by the numbers we all know the issues with hilary and hilary losing solves the hilary specific issues essentially however the hardline politics that seems to say its okay to call white people or men anything is a problem martin luther king jrs dream was to have people be judged by the content of their character real equality right now though far left wants to give minorities and women special status above others so called privilege people who speak to true equality are labeled as bigots most of the poor are white yet their privilege is assumed their problems ignored then trump spoke to them this is alienating people and if this is not solved theres going to be a term trump and another gop president after that
technology,not_removed,im not from the us so im not defending either candidates but im pretty sure trump lost the popular vote didnt hillary get and trump either way i agree that its not an issue because of the way your electoral system has always worked
technology,not_removed,i think theyre just scammers looking for the pity money there is certainly a ton of it out there a lot of women are riding on their rich husbands coat tails and they can afford it
technology,not_removed,statistics certain asians and jews least likely to commit crimes
technology,not_removed,when you say its not a justified fear you are dismissing all the times when women have acted on their fears by not making themselves vulnerable in public spaces what if women are justifiably afraid for example to jog in certain places where men are not afraid to jog you are saying women are being irrational at times when perhaps they are being very rational do you see my point also fears can speak to many things women are justifiably afraid of being sexually harassed in certain places or of potentially getting stalked by an uber driver another poster spoke about comfortability you are not being very precise with your view of statistics
technology,not_removed,statistically children are safer with men than with women who commit the most child abuse should we also design businesses and allow blatant discrimination because of this
technology,not_removed,youre right women are more likely to be assaulted or harassed by men than by other women and i said nothing to deny that i was making a statement about how men and women each feel about interacting with strange men that women less likely to be assaulted feel more afraid about it than do men more likely to be assaulted it doesnt change the fact that women are more likely to be assaulted by men than by women and i do understand the impulse to want to minimize contact with strange men to further reduce the odds of assault even if i dont support segregation initiatives to make that happen im just trying to point out that this wouldnt work the other way around a service that protected men from assaults by other men wouldnt have as strong a business case because men are less fearful of getting assaulted edit fixed an incorrect number
technology,not_removed,her speech was just pretending to care about men the actual campaign she was promoting treats gender equality as a oneway street because women are the only people who matter like we said extremist feminists arent the problem mainstream ones like emma watson and the united nations are the ones dismissing mens issues and telling us that equality should only go one way
technology,not_removed,its a long standing problem but its not a scandal or a crisis the largest factor is not that trump gained votes hilary got far less votes than obama and it closed the gap with trump in the electoral system
technology,not_removed,if men are of all victims of stranger violence and women are about twice as likely to be afraid in public then a considerable percentage of women are irrationally afraid while in public either that or men are irrationally unafraid which i dont buy because violence crime is a tiny fraction of what it was years ago and the frequency continues to go down youre essentially arguing against a straw man here by implying that im saying fear is never justified thats not at all what i said
technology,not_removed,thats incorrect they may commit the most abuse but its not at a higher rate per care giver
technology,not_removed,if you admit women would be objectively safer i really dont know why you would want to deny them that greater safety why its not just an impulse its a liberation from constraints of an otherwise indifferent market system
technology,not_removed,yeah and it is a good thing people are starting to understand just this and starting to turn on these sjw snow flakes it was quite humorous when a feminist had asked trump her stupid question and sat there with the typical obnoxious i am better than you attitude just to get shut down instantly i know reddit hates some trump but that was really funny video below edit ps the wage gap has been disproven hundreds of times now though her second point is valid
technology,not_removed,im not sure what you are trying to say here i was pointing out that there is extremism in any movement and usually these are used as scapegoats to criticize the movement as a whole im not excepting the criticism of said movement because of extremists im saying that its easier to pin everything under and umbrella than see the idea behind it im not going to enter the merit of altright or mra but i do want to point out that raw feminism the kind that seeks to speak about the problem women face has been dealing with shit for over a hundred years you can look on historic documents or if you are into movies you could watch suffragette to give a perspective of how these feminist movements are accepted and portrayed in society httprationalwikiorgwikigoodolddaysfeminism
technology,not_removed,the real question at hand here is whether women are statistically safer with female or male drivers should women look at your first sentence and conclude that they are somehow just as safe with men drivers as women drivers
technology,not_removed,i get the point theyre trying to make women are less likely to be assaulted by men than other men are but women that are assaulted are more likely to be assaulted by men than by other women therefore it follows that women that avoid contact with men are even less likely to be assaulted than women who dont
technology,not_removed,youve missed the point here the point is that discrimination against an entire demographic based on identity isnt justified regardless of the justification
technology,not_removed,why did you decide i was against this i havent said anything to indicate that
technology,not_removed,the rate of violent crime committed by uber or taxi drivers against customers is near per its a completely ridiculous thing to be concerned about at all regardless of the gender of any of the parties involved that youre helping to push the narrative that this is a justified fear is crazy its not its fear mongering and little else
technology,not_removed,thats probably true in general but there are very very few instances of taxi or uber drivers committing violent acts against customers its not a real concern its a concern thats based entirely on irrational and unjustified fear as for that actual stat its not entirely clear that thats true in reality there are some indications that this is a product of underreporting and not women being less likely to become violent there are lots of surveys and studies that indicate women are as likely to be violent theyre as likely to engage in domestic violence we know theyre less likely to be convicted or reported to the police for violent crime that may not eliminate the gap entirely it certainly wouldnt shrink much in the case of murder except murder of partners where women often use male proxies to commit violence but certainly the gap isnt as wide as crime statistics would seem to indicate
technology,not_removed,statistically children are safer with men than with women who commit the most child abuse i was responding to this statement which is false also you did not state anything to support the idea that discrimination against an entire demographic based on identity isnt justified im not saying whether that assertion is true or false however you said nothing to support it
technology,not_removed,i dont think theres anything feminism can do to change your opinion all i can do is hope others who read this are willing to not get swayed by news like this
technology,not_removed,its really not completely ridiculous at all considering that the murder rate itself is some fragment of if you were to be taken seriously no one should take precautions against being murdered and it would be completely ridiculous for anyone to try to avoid that since its statistically so rare in actual fact people will plan their entire lives around not getting murdered and they are not wrong to do so likewise women should be allowed to reduce the probability that they will get killed also my research indicates you are exaggerating the rate of stranger violence against women men are twice as likely to suffer stranger violence than women however perhaps you should do a comparison of how much more likely women are likely to suffer violence at the hands of a man rather than another woman since you are interested in statistics that alone should more than justify an all female riding service
technology,not_removed,im sure thats true to a point but think about it this way you probably have a better quality of life than someone thats homeless you still probably use services that further improve your quality of life no much in the same way women are at least somewhat safer than men are when interacting with strangers but theyll still support steps to further enhance their own safety as long as theres no opportunity cost for men in the form of tax dollars being spent on it limited campus realestate or side effects like even less safety for men then i see no reason not to support initiatives that further enhance the safety of women or to at least be ok with them
technology,not_removed,all this shit about immigrants you want to get elected promise to roast comcast on a pike
technology,not_removed,slams comcast but endorses clinton shes lost all credibility and just needs stop hypocritical af
technology,not_removed,only slams why isnt she blasting them
technology,not_removed,used to like her but shes all talk no action bet shes got negative favourability rating now too
technology,not_removed,clinton is pro net neutrality does that mean comcast owns her trump is anti neutrality that means big telecoms own him
technology,not_removed,all while holding hands with hillary yeah warren youre dead to me
technology,not_removed,just abolish the power of local governments to grant cable monopolies and all this shit goes away of course fauxcohontas cant conceive of any solution that doesnt involve more government
technology,not_removed,promises are easy to make
technology,not_removed,percent agree you cant pretend to be tough on corporations violating regulations and laws and then cozy up to their number one bought and paid representative
technology,not_removed,thats the problem with politics now endorse any candidate and theyre lost all credibility would you rather someone endorse trump i dont think hillary is a prize but definitely not as bad as trump i still wouldnt endorse her
technology,not_removed,part of being a politician is making comprises if youre angrily swinging a bat at the world dont expect to get much help on issues you want to fix
technology,not_removed,cry about it on reddit
technology,not_removed,yeah fuck her for doing one tiny thing reddit doesnt like even though shes still trying to push things through that you agree with smh
technology,not_removed,i feel like you read my comment in another thread criticizing their use of words like blasts and slams either way its fucking stupid and it needs to stop
technology,not_removed,i always prefer evisceration slam and blasting is just not enough violence for this american
technology,not_removed,yeah im curious how shes going to get any traction on any antitrust issues particularly with telecoms and media corps if her buddy rodham gets elected potus
technology,not_removed,how dumb are you she is one of senators and the repubs have the power she is presenting bills and programs she cannot get the repubs to vote for anything that helps the people instead of a corporation how do you think she could get the repubs to vote for a bill of hers all she can do is talk until the dems get a majorityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcurrentunitedstatessenators it is to independent
technology,not_removed,i love how the progressive queen is instantly criticized just because she dared to endorse hillary this is why liberals are a joke
technology,not_removed,i guess youre the only hero this country needs
technology,not_removed,yeah even a stopped watch is right twice a day
technology,not_removed,you can if you want to be hcs vp
technology,not_removed,and this time she compromised on her core tenets compromise has a limit otherwise you sacrifice integrity
technology,not_removed,compromise need not include campaigning vigorously for the antithesis of your lifes work
technology,not_removed,this is not an example of a politician compromising its an example of a politician being a sellout
technology,not_removed,theres a point where you compromise your integrity away and it doesnt matter anymore
technology,not_removed,i guess integrity is a foreign concept to you type of person i hope to avoid day to day
technology,not_removed,mate im talking about her failure to back the only actual progressive candidate in the democratic race
technology,not_removed,well she kind of went and endorsed someone who almost entirely represents the opposite of what she supposedly represented for the last few years early on there was also a big push for her to run against clinton herself
technology,not_removed,its almost as if being a politician involves politics
technology,not_removed,dae liberals
technology,not_removed,while i dont like her endorsement if she chooses to leave the senate to be clintons powerless vp then i will completely lose all respect for warren
technology,not_removed,i wonder what this place is going to do when bernie endorses clinton
technology,not_removed,by that standard an army must always charge headlong toward the other in an open field you would be a terrible strategist
technology,not_removed,sorry then i hear people say she has accomplished nothing regularly and it pisses me off but she backed sanders
technology,not_removed,its her vs trump hillary will be pushing progressive agendas not trump and its hilarious how youre writing off the progressive achievements of hillary
technology,not_removed,you have respect for any politician in america right now brave
technology,not_removed,the same clinton who is sitting down today with the fbi regarding a criminal investigation into her activity
technology,not_removed,lol thanks for that because clearly sticking to your word politically is the exact same as fighting a war honourably fool
technology,not_removed,she did not back sanders that article literally has a giant april fools if you actually click the link
technology,not_removed,hillary will be pushing progressive agendas no she wont dont let this social issue bs they use distract you from real issues that affect real people
technology,not_removed,hillary is progressive kek i mean i guess it is true shes pushing the boundaries of how far a literal criminal can go in a presidential race never before has someone under fbi investigation won the nomination thats progress
technology,not_removed,yes and people voted for her bernie has insisted on keeping his campaign clean and not attacking fellow candidates if he loses hell definitely endorse clinton
technology,not_removed,war isnt inherently honorable its people killing each other politicians cant accomplish anything if they alienate their peers its a shitty situation and i dont like it either but it doesnt help the situation to berate your allies for not making enemies and to call me names because you dont understand any other tactic than full speed ahead you call me a fool but what you want her to do is far more foolish all that would do is cut her from the herd and decrease her influence unless you dont actually care about what she is trying to push through and want her to fail or if you care about it but dont want her help either way youre shitting on your own ally idiot
technology,not_removed,you do realize how silly you sound by dismissing people as progressives when you yourself are claiming progressive issues arent real issues right
technology,not_removed,you do realize that universal healthcare is an idea originally proposed by hillary in the right and you do know why he gop has been throwing attacks at her for decades right
technology,not_removed,not attacking endorsing
technology,not_removed,she already lost what she was fighting for by endorsing the person that is opposite to her policies if you cant understand the fundamental differences and that there are times that you need to stand firm youre a sheep
technology,not_removed,speak for yourself a lot of us republicans like her better than trump
technology,not_removed,she did get most of the popular vote are you suggesting he makes enemies of the entire party
technology,not_removed,the person that is opposite to her policies how can you be so sure maybe she promised to be more open to these policies in the future you just have zero understanding of the actual situation and are taking it out on warren for not doing exactly as you wanted which was stupid anyway grow up
technology,not_removed,the entire party that funny he took almost have the vote in a primary where election fraud and voter suppression was rampant
technology,not_removed,dont get to big for your britches there little guy youve downvoted my comments all along for simply stating my opinion i have not done the same to your uninformed one perhaps you could stop acting so childish before asking me to grow up lastly how can i be so sure by being informed getting information from a variety of sources on both sides of the issue and having some common sense try some of these one day after youve grown up
technology,not_removed,if you have proof then make a post in a location with high traffic where your evidence will be vetted until then im going to treat that as a conspiracy theory
technology,not_removed,dont get to big for your britches there little guy you see fit to lecture me when you cant even figure out that you should have typed too instead of to that is basic word use a goddamn fifth grader should understand let alone a full grown adult you are further proving my point that you have no idea what you are talking about the downvotes arent for stating an opinion theyre for spouting ridiculous expectations only a complete ignoramus would have you have earned it fair and square perhaps you could stop acting so childish before asking me to grow up perhaps you should state your point with more intelligence so it can be more apparent that you are grown up until then grow up lastly how can i be so sure by being informed getting information from a variety of sources on both sides of the issue and having some common sense lol because any politician tells everything they say to anyone else to the press and despite years of elizabeth warren pushing progressive agenda she cant be trusted to do it anymore because hillary just stop youre embarrassing yourself try some of these one day after youve grown up you are truly a fool you really have no idea who youre arguing with
technology,not_removed,sorry son on mobile and unlike you i dont have time to double check grammar especially when conversing with a fool i mean did you get your mom to check my grammar for ya as for the rest of your rambling man youre making me pity you more so those that are forced to interact with you in person i weep for those poor poor souls for you i have only pity but please keep talking laughter is good for me and everyone else reading your responses
technology,not_removed,everything about this title is wrong its not a big change everyone has heard about it and the biggest change in a generation was the rise of google and social media by far which is something since the commercial internet is only a generstion old
technology,not_removed,there is no one dns server if you ever have any fears towards icann just use googles dns server if you fear them just use opendns fear all dns servers just use your own in your hosts folder you fucking idiot no one owns the internet and they never will there is no reason to take down a domain name because the information is still publicly accessible
technology,not_removed,this is not true the dns system cannot function if it becomes fragmented at best well end up with competing dns systems at worst they will make laws mandating that carriers actively block traffic by null routing any network segment that are blacklisted for hate speech or face probably face heavy fines in the eu
technology,not_removed,except icann doesnt have that power they control the tld like com or net or org but not sites on that tld like reddit of google that is handled by verisign in the case of com other companies handle other tlds the us has also had nearly nothing to do with icann since its inception its been run by an international body of governments and corporations censoring based dns is done at the isp level and the us and other countries have been doing it for some time this business with icann is not important is not the end of free speech online and isnt anything anyone has a readon to really care about
technology,not_removed,the dns system cannot function if it becomes fragmented um not sure what you mean by fragmented but each top level domain is managed by a different companyorganization uk is run by someone in the uk and the dns servers for it are controlled by the uk same with fr and cc and biz and on and on and on
technology,not_removed,the dns system cannot function if it becomes fragmented yes it can by my knowledge there are three different dns servers out there that are accessible to the every day joe if you use chrome youre already using googles dns server at best well end up with competing dns systems how is this a bad thing at worst they will make laws mandating that carriers actively block traffic by null routing any network segment that are blacklisted for hate speech or face probably face heavy fines in the eu this has nothing to do with dns servers or icann and when you say network segment i think you meant ip address if you didnt then you have no idea how the internet works at a basic level
technology,not_removed,again you obviously dont understand how dns functions the root dns servers are in charge of all tlds com mil gov org etc like a tree their information propagates to the next level of servers that are in charge of the next level etc if the root dns servers decide to drop googlecom all the servers below it will also drop googlecom the only solution to this is fragmentation which means that someone operates a rogue root domain server that does not obey the order to drop a domain this server will be blacklisted from all the lower level dns servers thereby forking the entire dns system how is this a bad thing its a horrible thing its like having phone number that goes to two different phones theres a reason why the phone system did not allow this to happen and yet it is certain to happen now to the internet this has nothing to do with dns servers or icann and when you say network segment i think you meant ip address if you didnt then you have no idea how the internet works at a basic level im a sysadmin with a masters in it i know exactly how the internet works you dont know wtf you are talking about ip addresses are given out in blocks routing works by sending traffic to routers based on network segment this is the function of bgp which i have no doubt is something youve never heard of when a particular network segment malfunctions that segment will be redirected to another segment on the same supernet and traffic will be sent around the malfunction this happens at both bgp level backbone level and routing level when totalitarian governments dont want people going to sites they dont like they dont generally block an ip address they generally null route the whole network segment meaning that instead of a router being able to forward traffic to another supernet to find the route the router drops the traffic entirely this is what will be used to block network segments that do not obey the new rules what this means to regular people is that if the us decides not to let its sites be censored then the countries who face un sanctions will block access to the network segments that dont obey them so while this might not affect the us dramatically its going to impose drastic amounts of censorship on the countries that do face such sanctions
technology,not_removed,httpwwwianaorgdomainsrootdb they dont control any of the subdomains they control who own com but verisign controls all the domains under con like reddit you dont know what you are talking about
technology,not_removed,iana isnt icann this change in icann governance has literally zero effect on ip addresses
technology,not_removed,its a horrible thing its like having phone number that goes to two different phones if the first phone number service had backwards censorship laws then im pretty sure said system would cease to exist and become irrelevant if icann truly does fuck up in a similar way i have reason to believe similar things might happen yea im not quoting that in here ok fine i learned something today and i truly thank you in that regard but if nobody has the balls to call out their governments and actually do something about said hate speech restrictions then whos fault is it when we can no longer use facebook and does facebook really die if a government blocks it no the answer is no if internet has to happen then it will happen you cannot control people and when you try people only try harder the only exception is north korea those people are fucked
technology,not_removed,the root servers tld managing servers cant drop individual domains only the tld specific roots can drop domain names under their own namespace and such ip range blocks that youre talking about has always been possible independent of anything icann does this change only means that us gives up their veto power over icanns decisions
technology,not_removed,well there are two nations that enjoy free internet and absolutely cant stand restrictions on speech the us and the russian federation most other countries already have all sorts of restrictions on speech the russian federation probably doesnt have specific protections for speech but they are very much profreespeech i would not be surprised to be involved in developing an alternet in the future that specifically is designed to work around and through such restrictions hell it might be my calling
technology,not_removed,you dont get it at all again people are so uninformed here that i want to fucking scream the root servers tld managing servers cant drop individual domains only the tld specific roots can drop domain names under their own namespace the organization in charge of authorizing registrars is icann if icann is ordered by the un push new laws upon the internet icann can either refuse likely resulting in fragmentation or most likely go along with un resolutions their multistakeholder model would evaporate if they rejected un resolutions this effectively puts the entire internet at the mercy of the un the us and other countries will not reject censorship provisions a because the government has always wanted censorship power over the internet b companies would lose fuckloads of business over rifts such as this why do you think youtube rolled out its censorship program literally weeks before this shit went down were fucked royally and youre too fucking stupid to see the writing on the wall talk to me in months and a year from now this site wont exist
technology,not_removed,oh ffs no it isnt not unless you wanna knock out every website ending in com they have no control over the subdomains they cant shut down just one websites because thats not something they control if i wanna know where reddit is my dns server will ask icann where com is icann will point to verisign actually the dns will usually already know this and not even ask my server has no more need of icann and hangs up it then asks verisign where reddit is and verisign gives an ip for reddit my dns server gives me this and my browser goes to that ip now often there is hard coding or caching used to not have to keep looking this up but thats how the dns works icann has no ability to censor a site please drop the namecalling take a deep breath relax everything is going to be finethere is nothing to be scared of here the internet will keep going as it always has
technology,not_removed,i dont think the internet works the way you think it does dude subdomains like reddit fall under the domains like com or whatever but as utuseroni pointed out you you cant change anything about whats inside com from whats outside com for exactly the same reasons as virgin media or comcast or localisp cant remove specific computers from your network they can disable your router and remove your ip address but they cant stop your laptop connecting to the internet and allow your phone and desktop because networks dont work like that
technology,not_removed,in usa they just harass people out of publishing stuff and in russia they just make them disappear if the wrong people are inconvenienced censorship by fear instead of technical
technology,not_removed,the russians have free speech hehe suuure its a country where you can get assassinated for getting in putins way too much and where saying you dont hate gays is propaganda
technology,not_removed,well with a masters in it and our political climate if you live in europe i think you might not have a choice because of the great firewall of china demands for vpn services have always stayed high and are going nowhere meanwhile their government stays as naive as ever im glad i could argue with you but i think were on the part where we keep agreeing with each other on the same topics while using different examples but by all means type in all caps if im wrong
technology,not_removed,and if they comply the rest of the world says goodbye well be making our own dns root and what icann is capable of is taking down top level domains like com by blocking verisign or whoever else runs the targeted tld why wouldnt un target the individual tld managers instead the un is not getting more power over icann because of us government giving up its veto they remain an american organization with a board with members evenly divided from multiple continents still including usa only acting on concensus theres nothing that un gains from going after icann instead of verisign or whoever else
technology,not_removed,remindme months
technology,not_removed,three months since this comment was made the predicted disaster doesnt seem to be unfolding
technology,not_removed,they cant shut down just one websites because thats not something they control yes it is thats what this whole thing is about the com tld controls dns name access to all subdomains this is fucking basic level networking at best if they are ordered by the un to blacklist a domain it disappears off of all canonical nameservers that is how the internet works when you do a dns query first it goes to the tld the tld points to the second level domains like reddit google etc all records propagate down from the top to edge caching short of forking the dns and naming authorities theres nothing a site can do to stop being blacklisted sure they can pop up on rogue domains like the pirate bay has done but is that something reddit should have to do
technology,not_removed,you dont get it the tld is the holder of all the records under it if the com tld stops registering reddit poof it disappears from all dns under it its a hierarchy not separate things
technology,not_removed,lol no im an american but i have lots of european friends and they are having big censorship problems as it is this might just cut off the only avenue of free speech left in europe outside of darknets
technology,not_removed,goodbye well be making our own dns root already been done httpsenwikipediaorgwikialternativednsroot
technology,not_removed,another months until we laugh at his this site wont exist prediction got my reminder set
technology,not_removed,when you do a dns query first it goes to the tld the tld points to the second level domains like reddit google etc icann has nothing to do with the srcond level domainsnothing verisign controls the domains for reddit and google icann has nothing to do with it they can at best ask verisign to remove a site they have no authority here verisign manages all domains under com icann manages where com points to these are sepparate institutions icann controls nothing below the tld dns based censorship is done either at the isp level or at the second level for instance verisign is a us company so the us would sometimes put the screws to them to censor sites you just cant censor a site from the tld
technology,not_removed,but icann doesnt have any control over what gets put in the com tld
technology,not_removed,if the com tld stops registering redditcom that was verisigns action the root server are never told what domains the clients want to go to the root servers gets asked about the tld only the tld servers gets asked about the domain that domains own dns server gets asked about subdomains like emailxy or wwwxy the tld is never told about it then those individual servers gets told about was what in the url resource string each step is totally blind about what happens in the next step they cant censor based on what they dont know
technology,not_removed,heres a northern european that doesnt have censorship problems sites arent really being randomly blocked here at all
technology,not_removed,no im an american ah that explains it
technology,not_removed,ive been living in europe all my life and travelled all around europe and ive never ran into a censored website in any country
technology,not_removed,you dont get it verisign cant stop the tld from dropping the second level domain com reddit www this is how dns is resolved and propagated if the com tld drops reddit it goes bye bye verisign literally cant do a fucking thing about it edit to clarify verisign is a tld registrar but they are not the ultimate authority on who gets what thats up to iana which is controlled by icann which is now going to be presumably controlled by the un not good at all
technology,not_removed,no but in germany they just put a bunch of people in jail for posting antiislamic memes in a private facebook group pretty sure that qualifies as major fucking censorship
technology,not_removed,no you dont get it icann doesnt control the reddit domain ok you almost seem to be there icann has no record of reddit when i try to resolve all icann knows is where the com server which verisign maintains is located not what records are in that server verisign controls that info they register the domains they remove the domains and they are who your dns will ask for the number to reddit here httpsenmwikipediaorgwikitopleveldomain for example in the domain name wwwexamplecom the toplevel domain is com responsibility for management of most toplevel domains is delegated to specific organizations by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers the management of the reddit domsin is delegated to verisign
technology,not_removed,icann is never told it is reddit you are looking for when you request redditcom they only get asked who runs com thats all they ever hear they dont know if you wanted to go to google or reddit or facebook or whatever they therefore are unable to selectively send you to a different tld root based on which domain youre going to because they have no idea where youre going
technology,not_removed,they were reprimanded for hate speech this is not the same as censorship nobody in germany is going to throw you in jail for rationally discussing the problems with islam if you say lol kill all pakis curry boys amirite then you will very rightfully get convicted freedom of speech is not and shouldnt be absolute europe has this right america is on electing donald trump for president take your pick
technology,not_removed,so thinner and longer battery life they should drop the pro from their macbook line then
technology,not_removed,because the software developers arent instructed to add such feature by their boss or dont have initiative or simply just lazy
technology,not_removed,you mean to read a text but to pretend to yourself that you didnt
technology,not_removed,blackberry does on their inhouse and android devices
technology,not_removed,sms vs http
technology,not_removed,iirc the platform simply doesnt support it
technology,not_removed,yes just as with my emails
technology,not_removed,its more to mark it so that you read it again later instead of it instantly being buried
technology,not_removed,http
technology,not_removed,this right here sms was basically an afterthought when they were first paving the way for how mobile telephone networks work and it was barely intended to do any of the things it does now
technology,not_removed,yeah that seems like a good reason i know a lot of people who take screenshots of memorable texts favorite would be a welcome feature
technology,not_removed,think whatsapp vs smssms is plain text but a packet data can be sent as attachment but not designed nor capable of reading a read receipt sms has status pending and sent and received marked on server but not readopened etc on device
technology,not_removed,the protocol doesnt need to support it the phone messaging program just has to add an extra variable to its internal representation of the message which just exists locally on the phone once the message is downloaded probably wouldnt be a trivial rewrite but its completely within the realm of possibility
technology,not_removed,what about imessage though
technology,not_removed,i think youre misunderstanding the question the device supports readunread and the op is asking why most phones dont support resetting the flag on the device back to unread
technology,not_removed,imessage is more complex than sms
technology,not_removed,on sms maybe im losing it
technology,not_removed,think whatsapp vs sms
technology,not_removed,richard susskind an oxford professor who has advised governments around the world said that in the coming years patients would be able to take pictures of their ailments and receive an accurate computergenerated diagnosis yeah this isnt an unfounded or stupid idea at all if it was this easy then american drug companies would have already set it up so that they could just mail their drugs directly to buyers they would already love to do the same by using just blood tests of course mr susskind himself is a lawyer not a medical professional he has literally no idea what hes talking about
technology,not_removed,well thats creepy as fuck i like their completely assbackwards excuse for it the warriors did so in an effort to become the most technologically aggressive nba team as warriors digital employee kevin cote said at the time its really about using technology to enhance the fan experience
technology,not_removed,shopkick did this as well as soon as i entered a target xprivacy popped up saying that shopkick wanted to listen to my microphone i noped that app off my phone with a quickness
technology,not_removed,from wikipedia a master bluetooth device can communicate with a maximum of seven devices in a piconet wifi is gonna be a better solution for what youre trying to do
technology,not_removed,anyone who knows and has experience on how academia works is zero surprised by this result
technology,not_removed,man the amount of butthurt in this article this is harassment telling me about my mistakes just own up to your errors dont blame the messenger
technology,not_removed,can the scientific journals get a copy of that bot science depends on experiments to be repeatable yielding the exact same results but there is very little funding to repeat a study just to check up on it unless it is in a very specific field with big consequences this bot could help finding problem studies before publication
technology,not_removed,crawling in the daaaaaark these wounds they eill not heeeeeeaaalll
technology,not_removed,i always knew science is bullshit
technology,not_removed,exactly all researchers are expected to be quite capable in statistics but its actually not very simple and thus mistakes will happen im doing my phd and i plan to outsource all statistics that end up in the publications to a professional statistician let statisticians do what they do best and let psychologists focus on the psychology and chemists in the chemistry
technology,not_removed,methodological terrorism holy shit was that special snowflake triggered lol
technology,not_removed,the article also stated that since papers with positive results are published much more frequently than papers with negative results errors that favor positive results would be much more prevalent than errors that favor negative results because if the error favors a negative result the paper would be less likely to be published so there are explanations but i agree that the skew toward positive results is very worrisome and indicative of purposeful manipulation
technology,not_removed,good thing i have some words carved into a stone to tell me how everything works
technology,not_removed,relevant username
technology,not_removed,is there any reason why you dont outsource to software
technology,not_removed,what happened to scientists understanding and analysing their own data doesnt this point to an insufficiency in training either in content or in rigour
technology,not_removed,an other explanation not based on malicious intent might be that when the errors favor negative results then the authors are more likely to recheck their calculations while if its positive they dont bother
technology,not_removed,well since negative results dont give the benefits that positive results do it is natural that people would be biased
technology,not_removed,software takes the inputs runs an algorithm and spits out results but you need to know which algorithm to use and how to interpret the results this is what statisticians do
technology,not_removed,just tell me where to get software that i can give my data tell which parameters are interesting and it chooses the right tests to use and interprets the results for me
technology,not_removed,the math and technology behind statistics has now gone beyond the ability of any one individual when it comes to clinical trials yes the pi and his team should have a level of understanding but they should not pretend they can do without a formally trained statistician when it comes to analyzing data infact even organizing the data is itself a skill which means a pi who lumps too many disparate variables together is going to have an equally difficult time creating viable results
technology,not_removed,ofcourse scientists also analyse their own data but to make sure all tests are correct they should have a statustician do the final work for publications you seem to underestimate the complexity of scientific statistics
technology,not_removed,its rather humours to see confirmation bias impacting the field that studies confirmation bias
technology,not_removed,this is the point often missed by many its not a question of how to use the machine its instead the question of which machine to use we havent quite yet written machines to identify which machines to use
technology,not_removed,yep im years out on my last statistics course i couldnt tell you shit about xbar and rbar charts other than knowing they exist
technology,not_removed,you hit the exact thing i love and hate about stats they are such an amazing tool and have given us so many valuable insights but they should never be used as often or for such serious things as quick justifications for policy stats take time resources care and repetition to yield their rewards
technology,not_removed,thats metalarious
technology,not_removed,thats how the war of the machines starts
technology,not_removed,he goes to egypt
technology,not_removed,tldr its google
technology,not_removed,i guess you could say each and everyone of us is a star
technology,not_removed,the joy of badly written clickbait popsci headlines now the tldr creationists will be saying its a sign while waving their six fingered fists in the air
technology,not_removed,imagine the galaxy is an amoeba if humans or any other race will be able to colonize it all imagine that we are everywhere in the galaxy and our science allows us to shape the galaxy move the stars whole systems creating the ultrastructures imagine us creating such structures for the organism receptors internal organs some sort of dyson layer equivalent of cell membrane all built of star systems such creature would be the most fascinating human creation who knows what we could see around us with the ultrastructural receptors maybe we would find that there is completely another level of reality as different from ours as the cellural size world
technology,not_removed,neutron stars rapidly spin on their axis millions of times per second while being immensely dense and have a habit of generating a field that negatively affects its surrounding bodies if you know what i mean
technology,not_removed,hey now youre an allstar
technology,not_removed,three quarks per nucleon three persons in the holy trinitycoincidence or proof of god
technology,not_removed,our universe is actually fully contained in a hyper beings equivalent of a ball sack
technology,not_removed,why wait ill do it right now for your life savings
technology,not_removed,the story had all the credibility of finding a picture of mary in a toasted cheese sandwich
technology,not_removed,nucleons have many quarks and antiquarks and gluons but always three more quarks than antiquarks i guess its still a proof of god
technology,not_removed,i dont see why not
technology,not_removed,just another reason the real name policy stinks
technology,not_removed,i cant wait to see what the army of tesla elon musk nut huggers on reddit have to say about this
technology,not_removed,i am surprised the tesla didnt have a lidar running
technology,not_removed,strikes trailer of and goes under goes under sodecapitation
technology,not_removed,tesla had million miles driven without a casualty from autopilot function a shame it was bound to happened eventually
technology,not_removed,youre late
technology,not_removed,whats there to say pay attention to the road its that simple
technology,not_removed,autopilot has fewer fatalities per mile driven than motorcycles which is a great comparison because it makes tesla look good because of this guy driverless cars will be banned forever this is why we cant have nice things we should beat some sense into this guy oh wait nvm nobody should ever have to make way or slow down for a truck screw truck drivers you have to skip past a warning screen to enable autopilot so tesla is totally and completely blameless its clearly labelled as beta software autopilot learns from experience so this death was a necessary part of finding bugs in it american roads and trucks are the real hazards here the tesla driver had a history of many near misses caused by autopilot where autopilot saved the day what about all those times where it worked
technology,not_removed,lidar is often a scan not plus i heard something about the autopilot ignoring some overhead inputs to avoid accidental breaking when passing under signs or overpasses this is definitely a new situation that should be taken into consideration for the autopilot
technology,not_removed,the driver still needs to pay attention for fucks sake this was the drivers fault and this asshats accident will set driverless cars back for years and will probably get the feds to ban systems like this too until further notice
technology,not_removed,completely agree as long as you know the car is the driver
technology,not_removed,tldr or fadsdr processor engineering researchers produced a proof of concept for a seeminglyinnocuous analog module placed on a specific region of a chip adjacent to another module that could be slowly nudged towards charged coupled capacitance of the other module and when that is achieved would give code that knew what to take advantage of unrestricted access to any system resources such a module would take up an extremely tiny percentage of the die would be difficult to identify visually and could be hidden in interior layers of the chips wiring would not affect the normal operation of the chip until triggered is analog in nature which is already a design domain considered by most silicon ees to be deep magic could be placed on the chip by technicians working for the manufacturer has no defense method short of making random samples to the chips subject to complete teardowns and contractually obligated respins if the exact masks provided by the designers were not used the last point is ridiculously not going to happen because foundries make tweaks to designs all the time because they have proprietary expertise on how to achieve best results with their process flow and materials and pitch which your freshfaced or even mildlyveteran fabless startup doesnt have any expertise in tldrttldr undetectable hardware backdoors that pwn your trustable silicon
technology,not_removed,considering that arm licenses its designs to other chip makers and those reference designs are available for any knowledgeable person to audit this scenario is highly unlikely if intel or amd tried something like that and were caught the ramifications would make the takata airbag recall or the vw dieselgate look like a walk in the park
technology,not_removed,now i can publish it
technology,not_removed,eternal september every popular website has dealt with a miniature version of it reddit especially but the internet as a whole is full of the same idiots you meet in life
technology,not_removed,didnt read the article the link opened properly but then atlantic blocked me from the page for using an old browser that wouldnt let all their advertisers show their messages ironic are trolls winning the internet
technology,not_removed,i love that the media takes random trolls so seriously yes they are winning you know why because you write fucking news articles about them
technology,not_removed,the article is not even wrong in that the premise is not supported or even properly defined what does it mean to say trolls are winning it means nothing because you have to define what winning means how do you even define it ecommerce purchases are still going up and to the right vs brick and mortar online streaming entertainment consumption is rising more people are using amazon and netflix than ever before social media use is rising sites like reddit are functional enough for people to use and enjoy them even with a percentage of assholes lurking about and as for the comment sections of most sites which have been cesspools virtually as long as the internet has existed they are easy to ignore does that degrade the value of the site content no you can consume media content all day long without giving a moments thought to the hidden comment sections which are invariably terrible so the article sets no logical definition of terms as to what winning means and on most common sense metrics of usefulness engagement and utility the trolls are not winning the internet is becoming more useful and more engaging for humanity over time not to mention the huge economic and societal changes at the margins that come with the developing world gaining mobile access to the web the whole piece is poorly conceived blather
technology,not_removed,what a crock of shit hackers and bot runners ≠ tasteless comments no one gives a shit about random jokers and if they do no amount of web monitoring will ever be enough to protect them from all the potential offences they might encounter
technology,not_removed,were becoming less empathetic and more narcissistic
technology,not_removed,the true history of mankind is leaking
technology,not_removed,do not feed the trolls
technology,not_removed,i wonder if they differentiate trolls from unfiltered honesty that some might feel is hurtful for example you shouldnt encourage a teenager to kill themselves but if you say kaitlin jenner looks like a gay zombie
technology,not_removed,why do articles like this say the internet when theyre only talking about twitter and some other social media sites its nice to see people finally cracking the code that twitter isnt that good of a website but do they not know there are other sites out there besides the ones that have share buttons
technology,not_removed,so its not the isps that rake you over the coals every month only to want more while providing less
technology,not_removed,the internet is where the mainstream media went to die rip which is a win for everyone
technology,not_removed,in my opinion since getting likes upvotes reblogs and responses is somewhat rewarding people just do it for the attention something popular shocking or rude will most likely get you that
technology,not_removed,theyll continue to win niel postman predicted as such with his book amusing ourselves to death although at the time he couldnt imagine what the internet would become and instead used cable tv as the basis for his arguments
technology,not_removed,one by one the case is being built to lock down and regulate the internet and the variety of voices that can be present
technology,not_removed,snowflakes are letting them
technology,not_removed,mainstream narrative like rworldnews losing then
technology,not_removed,actually the trolls created the internet technologists came later
technology,not_removed,we need a real reputation system for people and the ability to not interact with those who dont meet a certain standard if we so choose anonymity​ is important of course but any individual or business or website should also be able to choose not to interact with lowreputation people
technology,not_removed,they won a battle not the war they have zero morals will lie cheat and steal posts without s second thought we will build tools to stop them
technology,not_removed,check out its worth a read
technology,not_removed,the internets always been owned by trolls the normies are just mad its leaked into their facebook safespaces
technology,not_removed,we did it reddit s
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,weve been pushing our representatives here in ohio to make trolling a punishable offense some people disagree but its actually gaining traction some of the tenants involved will force sites to make people read through the site first similar to those tos agreements where you have to scroll all the way down but even more involved having people face fines for excessive vpn use and even using your real name while online for certain sites think fb and googleyoutube new hamphire is also joining in i hope that more states follow the internet is a fantastic place we must protect it regardless of what some people think this is for the best and for those wondering starting fines would range from an initial up to per offense depending on the number of prior offenses
technology,not_removed,advertising is the original troll
technology,not_removed,what browser you using
technology,not_removed,im curious what you use for a browser and how old is it
technology,not_removed,dont feed the trolls i mean how freaking hard is it
technology,not_removed,i feel like this is exactly the kind of post the article is talking about whether you want to call it trolling or not poster has a short argument to make focuses on calling the op full of shit and generally an idiot to even dare think the way they do whether or not your arguments are right you dont really take the time to support them and seeing how you treat others most reasonable people arent really inclined to add to the discussion and perhaps get hit with the same level of vitriol by people like you in the end the internet is filled only with people willing to dish out the same level of vitriol they put out
technology,not_removed,no one gives a shit about random jokers unfortunately i think a lot of people do give a shit have you not seen how big a deal offensive content has been lately across a huge variety of subjects
technology,not_removed,i agree about the empathy but i think narcissism is just easier and more socially acceptable to display nowadays i cant imagine that years ago the practice of taking and displaying pictures of oneself on a regular basis would be met with anything but revulsion
technology,not_removed,you havent the faintest idea what trolling is
technology,not_removed,tldr nobody cares
technology,not_removed,no it hasnt ive been here since before eternal september i remember how it used to be
technology,not_removed,that would be the death of the internet most of use has come to love what makes it a fantastic place is the freedom of it you think you are protecting it but youre ruining it and how would you even define trolling in legal terms anyone who makes someone else feel bad
technology,not_removed,the internet is a fantastic place we must protect it so you want to establish rules that will arbitrarily target people
technology,not_removed,troll winning
technology,not_removed,the boogeyman is the lord of all trolls
technology,not_removed,an older mac and safari
technology,not_removed,its a self evident point aggressive hijacking of hardwaredestruction of propertycybertheft are a serious problem rolling those issues that actually need addressing in with people who make controversial remarks is ludicrous and clearly pushing a totalitarian cyberspace agenda offensive trolling can range from simple misunderstandingpoor expression to drunk typing to attempts to intimidate but ultimately its just words on a screen and should be treated no different than that anonymous asshole that screams out something ignorant in a crowd you ignore them
technology,not_removed,contingent upon sufficient anonymity
technology,not_removed,i downvoted this comment without even reading it so that it become negative points trollwinning
technology,not_removed,put a little vitriol on your steak and massage into face for an hour helps open pores and leaves the skin feeling youthful and vibrant edit just did some research if you dont have any or enough vitriol on hand just push your face into the nearest persons butcheecks aim for the middle they may or may not like it do this for vibrant radiant skin everyday you only have to try this once to see immediate results
technology,not_removed,maybe you should grow a pair and stop whining the world isnt always gonna work the way you want it to work
technology,not_removed,definitely easier and more acceptable but i think our consumer society and an emphasis on me has definitely pushed us to be more and more narcissistic
technology,not_removed,i dont see how it would even protect us better against terrorism it would make more people respect oneanother as well there is nothing wrong with wanting these things dont wear tin hats please this is so much more than a silly conspiracy with the government stealing our data
technology,not_removed,well dont fucking tell them jesus akbar
technology,not_removed,to be fair older versions of safari can be pretty awful as apple neglected it for a while given that though just because the advertisements wont work thats a pretty poor reason to block a user from viewing your site if anything advertisers should use fallback versions of thier ads that are simple images instead of overblown interactive widgets that require specific javascript features
technology,not_removed,so like safari
technology,not_removed,have you ever had a random person on the sidewalk just scream at you maybe for something you said or did or watched it happen to someone else you instantly just want to get the fuck away from that situation its not ignoring them its fear whether offensive trolling is a natural part of online communication or not high levels of assholery or vitriol have an effect beyond what a reader can just ignore they make the vast majority of people less inclined to post just to stay away from the crazies in the discussion section already something like just read and never post hi guys and the people who do post are at the same level of vitriol the cycle continues and continues as the already small minority of people who do post to becomes smaller and smaller till they dont really have anything in common with the average person at all
technology,not_removed,i think its an overall change in attitudes from collectivism to individualism
technology,not_removed,and it was boring as hell
technology,not_removed,please enlighten me how making terrorists read through tos and use their real names on services they dont use would protect us against terrorism
technology,not_removed,next level stupid
technology,not_removed,yes of course as we all know the only thing between us and a respectful society is a law banning illdefined online behaviour thank christ you dont run a goddamn thing
technology,not_removed,so people would act nicer to one another if legislation existed to compel them to do so or face monetary punishment maybe i dont know if the statistics existed i would be curious to see whether there exists a history of other offenses being reduced once they were outlawed jaywalking for example i dont imagine these offenses are tracked before they become outlawed though framing someone for being a troll sounds like the kind of game trolls would have all sorts of fun playing itd be like swating someone only with less of a burden on the general public taxpayers and more of a free cash for the government through fines result im curious what would make a municipality attempt to outlaw troll framing when the result is free money for the municipality
technology,not_removed,ads very much are the limiting factor on like of difficult sites the actual content is almost never an issue
technology,not_removed,this is certainly all true but i think the problem isnt going to be solved by silencing and censoring people on the internet if anything i think that would cause a whole slew of other far worse problems to occur i think a big issue is that the internet itself is young and people are still learning how to interact on it and learning how to be civil with one another with time the online communities will calm down and maybe then well see more than just of people commenting articles like this one always seem to be screaming doom and horror from a few personal experiences i mean from my perspective it seems like each year people have been getting a bit more civil and peaceful on here and at the very least a wider range of people and cultures are being represented
technology,not_removed,have you ever had a random person on the sidewalk just scream at you maybe for something you said or did yes and its not the same thing as having someone type angrily at you online not by a long shot this is a problem i see more and more with for lack of a better term safe space groups the idea that online speech should be treated the same as real world speech you cant ignore someone screaming at you on the street you cant block someone calling you an asshole in a shop you can block and ignore people online in fact its very easy to do most social media sites even have tools to help make it easier for you to block people you feel harassed by trolls feed on attention by whining about them and trying to silence them youre only giving them what they want the problem isnt the trolls the problem is that the internet is now full of thinskinned whiners who dont understand how to deal with trolls properly thus making it easier for people to be trolls
technology,not_removed,its to the point on reddit where maybe its always been this way and it just irks me to no end now that the top comment is almost always a joke a pun or a question immediately followed by one those are the things i consider trolling not because they are purposely trying to dilute discussion but because like a child looking to be accepted it is the absolute easiest form of acceptance laughter instead of actual thought sometimes i get frustrated and point this out but mainly dicussion is no longer as fruitful or enjoyable when the equivalent of being mocked and echoed with a baby voice is the only conversational partner
technology,not_removed,it sounds like youre saying that because some people might discourage open discussion and free speech we should systematically and definitively repress it is that what youre saying because that sounds like what youre saying
technology,not_removed,individuality is important but i think we have many people in this country that take it to the extreme and that seems to be increasing
technology,not_removed,also wrong stupid and mildly annoying
technology,not_removed,the problem isnt the trolls the problem is that the internet is now full of thinskinned whiners who dont understand how to deal with trolls properly thus making it easier for people to be trolls the most sensible statement here yet upvote for you sir
technology,not_removed,thats not what im saying at all its not a freaking binary choice where you either love free speech or hate it because mean people on the internet hurt your feelings its just that in contrast to how you seem to feel i feel that this stuff has a real and important effect on the value of the internet mostly because it indirectly affects what kind of stuff people are reading when they read posts ei if most posts online are really done by of people than that causes an even greater distortion effect on peoples worldview than any kind media bias since online discussions are nominally normal people even in open forums the average poster isnt really an average person at all
technology,not_removed,twitter says a lot of things and does very few of them
technology,not_removed,im honestly shocked that criticizing a religion is considered to be hate speech religions are beliefs and beliefs must be scrutinized i think the special protection for religion is a terrible thing there is a difference between the critique of a belief system and advocating for violence against followers of a faith
technology,not_removed,but keep using it to spread jihadi ideology
technology,not_removed,get ready for a posting on rwebjobs that says i need a website thats just like twitter except it is going to be a great great site where only i can say things and it needs to go on whitehousegov not much pay in it but it would be good exposure we have the best exposure an amazing resume builder
technology,not_removed,i dislike trump too although i perhaps dislike censorship and silencing even more but going so far as to ban the democratically elected us president for disagreeable political speech surely that would be the final nail in twitters coffin
technology,not_removed,then there will be the giant sucking sound as trump establishes trumper and everyone leaves twitter for trumper except of course amy schumer she never leaves even when she promised seriously leave amy
technology,not_removed,people need to leave twitter its obviously not working nor is it a fair platform for discussion
technology,not_removed,and yet people can still post stuff like fuckwhitepeople killallmen and yaydeadcops that isnt hate speech at all
technology,not_removed,the first time in us history a president has been banned from twitter
technology,not_removed,trump is the best thing thats happened to twitter lately why ban your best marketing campaign
technology,not_removed,most recently claimed that abdul razak ali artan who allegedly carried out an attack injuring students at ohio state university should not have been in our country artan was a legal permanent us resident whose family had fled somalia for pakistan in he arrived in the states in so the us should be welcoming terrorists in the country is it really that hard to admit that the us screwed up by letting a murdering terrorist past our borders just years ago
technology,not_removed,what ever happened to business people running companies for a profit rather than burning them to the ground in the service of virtue signalling
technology,not_removed,wouldnt it be awesome if trump announced the president doesnt need to tweet a response to every little thing that goes on in the world and therefore he will not be tweeting either with his own account or potus if something important happens he can put out a press release or hold a news conference wait thats never going to happen but wouldnt it be great if a future president did it
technology,not_removed,way to kill off your platform even more
technology,not_removed,but doesnt ban jihadists or pedophiles good work twitter
technology,not_removed,headline twitter will enforce its rules how do people make money to write this shit i want in on it
technology,not_removed,well all it takes is to have a conservative point of view and then review ghost busters
technology,not_removed,hes been on twitter for a long time has made many posts so either hes never broken the rules before shh dont tell the liberals or twitter is now going to enforce rules it failed to enforce before it wouldve made a good headline so either trump isnt the hate monger they make him out to be or twitter is a two faced double standard social network only interested in its rules when they make headlines
technology,not_removed,or you could just not censor anything
technology,not_removed,oh twitter pleasei beg of youban trump for hate speech rules god the shitshow that would follow that would be amazing might also get twitter to stop this insanity and go back to just keeping the servers running and doing the bare minimum required by law and let people just fucking talk
technology,not_removed,great idea ban the one guy whose controversial remarks drives what little much needed attention your dying social platform needs genius
technology,not_removed,hate speech is a no but pedophilia is still a go
technology,not_removed,who gives a shit
technology,not_removed,hahahahahahahhahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahauhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahaha
technology,not_removed,anybody who thinks different than me is a troll
technology,not_removed,twitter is literally a festering piece of shit
technology,not_removed,that would just be hypocritical come on
technology,not_removed,liberal censorship on full display
technology,not_removed,hate speech rules
technology,not_removed,the liberal fascist machine keeps turning twitter and companies with ceos that bow down to their political overlords give good liberals a bad name
technology,not_removed,and hell throw a tantrum and try to shut then down much laughing will be done and hell orange duck face pout himself to sleep for several weeks then theyll unlock his account and wait for the next tantrum
technology,not_removed,they should do it just for the lulz imagine how funny that would be how aggrieved and pissy hed get wed never hear the end of it and twitter would be waaaaayyyyy better if all his troglodyte followers boycotted it as well
technology,not_removed,trump could just buy twitter outright and change its name to trumpet
technology,not_removed,i still cant believe he became president
technology,not_removed,this is what you voted for you dumb fucking trumpler supporters
technology,not_removed,we need a law to enshrine your inalienable right to a twitter account even donald trump would support such a law
technology,not_removed,oooo dems fightin werds
technology,not_removed,rules are enforced selectively anyway it would hurt their business if they did block him they still wouldnt do it if he blatently breaks their rules in the future
technology,not_removed,twitter also actively suppresses conservative ideas on its platform and has banned conservatives for its own arbitrary definition of hate speech while conveniently not enforcing it at other times the only reason i dont see them banning trump is because he has such a big following and they would no doubt see a backlash
technology,not_removed,yep lately they cant seem to get out of thier own leaderless way
technology,not_removed,no wonder trump is such a fan
technology,not_removed,they also dont turn a profit ever
technology,not_removed,just like trump
technology,not_removed,twitter is a public company and its biggest individual shareholder is the saudi prince it doesnt take a lot to figure out why theyre the way they are
technology,not_removed,critiicisng some religions is hate speech so for instance its perfectly ok to criticise christians not even remotely religious
technology,not_removed,given that were talking about twitters platform the answers is twitter also relevant
technology,not_removed,so who gets to determine what is hate speech and what is not twitter as influenced by societys expectations
technology,not_removed,which is why theyd probably lose such a fight
technology,not_removed,to be fair there is a very good reason to allow this intelligence is crucial in fighting a threat like isis alqaeda etc by allowing this propaganda its very clear who is a threat to national security and who needs to be very closely watched
technology,not_removed,why would you want to stifle the potuss speech lets say he is conducting hatespeech wouldnt you want as many people as possible to hear it the electorate should be given as much information about our leaders as possible not less
technology,not_removed,will they also ban potus
technology,not_removed,when the revolution comes twitter will do whatever the despot in charge tells them to see syria egypt
technology,not_removed,no not political rhetoric hate speech so things like racist remarks threatening sexism etc
technology,not_removed,surely that would be the final nail in twitters coffin are there other nails and why would many twitter users care about this most people i know dont use twitter for political purposes but for technology etc
technology,not_removed,youre not entitled to anything online
technology,not_removed,and everyone leaves twitter for trumper why would anyone do that
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,nah hell just have one of his companies acquire twitter and force everyone to autofollow him
technology,not_removed,also the first us president to receive a stone cold stunner
technology,not_removed,there are a lot of first times in history with trump almost all of them bad
technology,not_removed,hashtag killwhitey
technology,not_removed,those people do exist i would hope that you dont think they represent the greater majority of that movement every large crowd attracts hooligans and perhaps blm has more than its fair share but the reality is that large masses of people inevitably contain elements that exploit the relative safety in order to cause destruction its important not to conflate political and social movements with the actions of the most maladjusted within them
technology,not_removed,only thing i can figure is there must be some kind of profit in it well or they have allowed sjws to infiltrate to their highest ranks and kill it from the inside
technology,not_removed,come ondont you wanna see donald trump in a fight with twitterjust a little
technology,not_removed,and then review ghost busters or dont review it httpwwwtherebelmedialeftwingmalefeministsareenragedthatangryvideogamenerdjamesrolfewontreviewtheallfemaleghostbusters
technology,not_removed,or maybe twitter is saying they dont consider trumps speech hateful amd its really a backhanded complement to trump
technology,not_removed,praise lord trump
technology,not_removed,reading between the lines get rid of everyone that disagrees with me got it build an echo chamber for
technology,not_removed,im pretty sure we didnt vote for twitter bans
technology,not_removed,isnt it already going down the shitter as is last i heard theyre losing a lot of money
technology,not_removed,define conservative please cite examples for your claims
technology,not_removed,im not a fan of the corporateowned social mediums that weve developed the internet of the was an entirely different beast
technology,not_removed,seriously holy crap that certainly explains the bias
technology,not_removed,hey that is the
technology,not_removed,youd never know it was ok given the massive outrage over next to nothing the right is always bitching about has fox news not been running a ludicrous war on christmas section for several years now
technology,not_removed,anytime i citizens christanity i get told im going to hell
technology,not_removed,criticizing christianity for its beliefs is different from criticizing christian people thats where i see the difference criticism of islam doesnt end at the beliefs but instead bleeds into criticism of the muslim population ie the call for a ban on muslims
technology,not_removed,please stop citing that stupid xkcd comic he is politically left wing and purposely misrepresents facts see httpsenwikipediaorgwikipruneyardshoppingcentervrobins or even the christian bakers forced to make gay wedding cakes
technology,not_removed,you means as influence by their owners and employees politics
technology,not_removed,theyd lose a fight to manage their own company nobody has a right to post on twitter
technology,not_removed,also the jihadis sometimes inadvertently give away their ip addressesphysical addresses by posting on social media like that one who tried to host a second ama and got blown up by an airstrike from the data revealed by the first ama
technology,not_removed,so thats one reason not to ban trump then
technology,not_removed,see i imagine youre thinking of all the people who will read what he says and go wow how can our president say that but what about all the people who say wow i knew i was right about that particular minority group the president will help guide our culture just getting elected spurred assaults from both sides listening to what he has to say wont lead to objective good
technology,not_removed,the definition of hate is fairly subjective and extremely political these days theres vocal activists claiming to be fighting racism or sexism who are very quick to lash out at a generalisationstereotype of white people or men for example and apparently thats ok
technology,not_removed,ah okay so just political speech that they disagree with anti hate speech bullshit is the biggest threat to free speech i have ever seen
technology,not_removed,well if we follow the list of companies that have said negative things about trump in the recent election banning him would definitely destroy their stock i doubt people will appreciate a social media platform with a large saudi owned stock to ban the president of the united states
technology,not_removed,yes we all know that corporations can do whatever the hell they want they have absolutely no obligation to allow freedom of expression on their platform and theyre perfectly entitled to engage in heavyhanded censorship for political reasons that doesnt mean that people shouldnt call them out if they appear to be doing such things
technology,not_removed,to make twitter great again
technology,not_removed,freedom of speech mostly
technology,not_removed,twitter has a market cap of about as much as trump claims hes worth on his best day in reality its probably worth as much as he is
technology,not_removed,funny because there was a legitimate experiment the other day involving tweets with both antiblack and antiwhite messages and only the antiblack messages were banned
technology,not_removed,killtheboer
technology,not_removed,classic example of its just a few bad apples
technology,not_removed,i would hope that you dont think they represent the greater majority of that movement nope its all of them just like sjws through gamergaters under the bus because of the actions of a handful of douchebags who did uncool shit in their name what comes around goes around
technology,not_removed,so let me understand your argument since someone born in america is a murderer we should start importing terrorists or maybe just maybe we have enough of our own shit to take care of that we dont need to import radical terrorists to compound our problems
technology,not_removed,million gun owners didnt kill anyone today when are you going to stop referring to them as a danger
technology,not_removed,virtue signalling can certainly be a business move see jennifer lawrence one of the worlds most well paid actors reading off incredibly well crafted wage gap propaganda emma watson shilling at the un those christian businesses waiving leviticus around etc it is hard for the outside observer to quantify the value without some metrics it certainly doesnt help that public responses to virtue signalling seem to vary considerably between cases or that the political winds have clearly just done a volte face making any prior information invalid for prediction as for sjw infiltration thats a serious factor it is trivial to find examples of identity politics and false or trumped up accusations resulting in negative business outcomes it is very difficult to locate examples where sjw ideology has benefited a business in a concrete quantifiable way businesses are run by people and most people lack the dispassionate disposition to wholly remove their values from their decisionmaking most of the time its okay to have a bit of yourself and your bias in the mix not so much when you would rather fiddle while rome burns
technology,not_removed,he would probably publically shame them and stick with fb and maybe even look into alternatives however i doubt it would get to that point most likely they would not dare they would maybe try to make a public statement to get it to the attention to the public like this and then have a discussion about it
technology,not_removed,please site your sources for your claims
technology,not_removed,the donald isnt a free speech social media platform it even says its a protrump subreddit of course if you talk bad about him they wont like it this isnt even an argument
technology,not_removed,do you really not see the difference between reddits usergenerated subreddit system and a mainstream social media platform censoring and suppressing ideas they disagree with mind you thedonald is openly dedicated to protrump content and is a privately created non default subreddit
technology,not_removed,heil trump too soon
technology,not_removed,theyve always been losing money it doesnt mean that their service isnt incredibly popular or important just that they cant monetize it
technology,not_removed,they made in revenue last year unfortunately inexplicably they spent if they would just stop spending so much fucking money theyd be laughing
technology,not_removed,thats what happens when you capitulate to a vocal minority at the expense of the bulk of your userbase
technology,not_removed,yeah they stopped growing and laid off a lot of their staff to stem the bleed they may be able to stop losing money but investors are not going to get back what they paid in
technology,not_removed,they allow selective hate
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,yeah there are times i miss the unenforced juvenile internet that glided under the radar good times the freedom that anonymity brought both in an individual and group sense on the net is going the way of the dodo now days reddit facebook etc routinely make tv news which fascinatingly is dying
technology,not_removed,what surprises me is that the people whore saying russia is intervening in the elections dont say a single word about one of the biggest social outlet being a saudi mouthpiece
technology,not_removed,im trying to figure out why you are using a a satirical cartoon in reposnse to a question
technology,not_removed,i stopped listeningwatchingreading the professionally indignant a long time ago its all just provocative clickbait fox news is not the right any more then the new york times is the left it is a business that caters to and profits by clickbaiting the right
technology,not_removed,i think you a word there do you believe them
technology,not_removed,criticizing christianity for its beliefs is different from criticizing christian people no it really isnt there is no chrisitanity other than groups of people who share beliefs meh ban on muslims never happen unconstitutional the only pressidnt to come colse was fdr and the japaneseamerican internment camps in possible to ban immigration from muslim countries presidents have done things like that one thing i have learned about trump is to ignore what he says and pay attention to what he actually does he says lots of shit and during the campaign it was mostly to provoke responses from the media
technology,not_removed,i said what i mean
technology,not_removed,but everyone has a right to work at twitter
technology,not_removed,until president trump gets banned anyways
technology,not_removed,and got blown up by an airstrike from the data revealed by the first ama he got blown up because he was living with is fighters in raqqa itself i think not because the air force somehow tracked his location through a reddit post
technology,not_removed,jesus fuck you got a link to that ama
technology,not_removed,i think we know where trump is right now since hes the freaking president
technology,not_removed,people are incharge of their own actions trumps words dont cause anyone to act inappropriately they choose to act inappropriately we shouldnt run our society based on our outliers
technology,not_removed,yeah like if trump says illegal immigrants cause a lot of problems in the us some will classify that as hate speech others as the truth its all very vague
technology,not_removed,thats why they have rules on twitter it goes from being subjective to being hard and fast hate or not
technology,not_removed,the definition of hate is fairly subjective and extremely political these days sure and twitter gets to decide how its defined on their network
technology,not_removed,if you cant tell the difference between distasteful political speech and hate speech you need to grow up
technology,not_removed,youre free to not use twitter if you dont like their position is more free i hear
technology,not_removed,tried that with youtube didnt work
technology,not_removed,why is twitter owned by the government
technology,not_removed,is twitter government owned
technology,not_removed,its surprising whenever somebody mentions freedom of speech in a way that demonstrates that they understand what that means this is not one of those occasions twitter is a privately owned company every user is subject to their whims unless people are being banned based on protected traits
technology,not_removed,and none of that is assets all smoke and mirrors since the ad revenue can be lost overnight
technology,not_removed,funny because this is the fourth time this thread ive seen this socalled experiment used as a source when it was fundamentally flawed from the start
technology,not_removed,yeah thats exactly right riots happen in crowds that have nothing to do with anything have you ever been to a college football game the fact is blackmask anarchists show up whenever a large crowd organizes on city streets theyre almost always angry confused teenagers who have nary a political inclination in their head except wanton destruction you grant them far more agency than they actually have feel free to watch videos of the portland protest and youll undoubtedly hear thousands of people chanting peaceful protest and doing little else meanwhile amidst all of that a few little shitheads stroll in with backpacks pull out molotov cocktails and fuck everything up for everybody
technology,not_removed,so trumps views represent those of all republicans your logic not mine e eerily silent i guess they do
technology,not_removed,who granted these heads their authority and representative clout out of curiosity also do you have a link to some of this antiwhite propaganda id like to see some of what youre talking about because it sounds very disturbing to me
technology,not_removed,youre right i dont really use twitter so i think i naturally gravitate away from talking about it
technology,not_removed,an eye for an eye will leave everyone blind
technology,not_removed,op is an sjw or a troll just ignore it
technology,not_removed,they can monetize it to the tune of a year they just cantwont spend less than they make
technology,not_removed,dont forget about the verified muslim brotherhood account
technology,not_removed,its hilarious how he says white men are a problem straight white men are a problem oooh cant accidentally insult a member of a highcaste group
technology,not_removed,they werent identical accounts in fact it looked like they were set up and chosen specifically to get the intended result the account that got suspended was a brand new account and the offending tweet was its only tweet the account that didnt get suspended was an established account with plenty of tweets and followers what the whole ordeal proved is only that twitter is faster to ban new accounts which should come as a surprise to no one and is why the new account was chosen for the black tweet be careful when you claim bias because it might not be where you think it is
technology,not_removed,tis true my friend twitter is a cesspool of uneducated leftist teenagers source am teenager
technology,not_removed,you wanted an explanation for why christianity lacks special protections that provides a pretty clear one viacom is afraid to show a picture of mohammed while they gladly profit off letting jesus be lampooned on a regular basis for a reason
technology,not_removed,fox news is not the right any more then the new york times is the left it is a business that caters to and profits by clickbaiting the right does this not then indicate the right does hold these same views given theyre catering to that audience as someone whos lived in alabama and georgia the last years i assure you the main narrative among conservative christians is that they are the constant victims of oppression
technology,not_removed,i dont get auto correct sometimes
technology,not_removed,i wasnt really pointing my target toward trump but i guess the muslim ban is just a bad example when trying to make a broad point maybe a better example is that people can criticize christianity as a faith and question its morality plausability and the like but those people who raise those questions dont feel a certain way towards christian people because of it but muslims in todays society especially women who are easily identifiable as muslim because of clothing hijab are themselves victims of not only hatefilled criticism but unwarranted violence im just saying there is a huge distinction its apples and oranges in todays america
technology,not_removed,of course but youre still wrong those who censor get to choose what to censor the fact theyre losing users as apposed to stagnation or gaining proves theyre not in league with what society their users want
technology,not_removed,what do you mean like everyone can have a job there if they want how would twitter hire everybody that applied
technology,not_removed,well how are we supposed to feel superior for being resistors now didnt we solve the boston bomber case didnt we stop global warming didnt we bring an end to a war in the middle east edit apparently we just complained online and didnt actually solve anything
technology,not_removed,except for when he sneaks out to dinner without notifying the press s
technology,not_removed,sadly i think you believe that he is not the president yet
technology,not_removed,yes lets all pretend that what the president says doesnt matter
technology,not_removed,and on top of that too while twitter is a private company and can do whatever it wants with what is acceptable speech technically speaking hate speech is protected free speech unless it is a threat or libel towards an individual
technology,not_removed,twitter enforces its rules when twitter feels like enforcing its rules and does so onesidedly its still subjective
technology,not_removed,kind of like how that person made two twitter accounts and posted inflammatory remarks except in one it said white people and the other replaced white with black the person then reported both tweets for rules violation for hate speech or whatever guess which one got banned and which one didnt if you guessed that the one talking shit about black people got banned and the one about white people did not you are correct because rules
technology,not_removed,not in this country words are words speech is protected in the us we have no right to prevent offense tldr sticks and stones will break my bones but words can never hurt me
technology,not_removed,its actually not
technology,not_removed,not that he said that in any way but if people feel that one service is stifling their experience over another service they will obviously go for the other service
technology,not_removed,given the latest fbi contract with a twitter subsidiary they are at least partially funded by the government
technology,not_removed,are you being dense on purpose nobody said its illegal
technology,not_removed,instead of acting smug perhaps you should learn the difference between freedom of speech and the first ammendment the number of authoritarian echo chamber lovers on this site is insane now a days
technology,not_removed,please site your sources
technology,not_removed,i have a theoretical reason for this i can almost guarantee you the fbiciansa stepped in and told them not to ban it its far more valuable to have it active and monitored than banning it and having to track down where they ran off to maybe its also a honeypot who knows
technology,not_removed,so perhaps the next experiment to be run is to create two new accounts one account posts something that has i hate when black people other other posts i hate when white people each post gets reported by someone participating in the experiment and see which gets deleted first
technology,not_removed,or it might be i have heard a dozen people make this defense nobody has tried the experiment
technology,not_removed,ah sorry got it now
technology,not_removed,its so bad even south park is afraid to picture mohammed
technology,not_removed,and which group isnt the constant victims of oppression these days
technology,not_removed,in fact there is amost no antimuslim violence in the us and most of the violence in the name of islam is from a very small number of countries
technology,not_removed,the fact theyre losing users as apposed to stagnation or gaining proves theyre not in league with what society their users want maybe or maybe they just prefer facebook you infer too much from too little
technology,not_removed,how would twitter hire everybody that applied twitter should have to hire people according to criteria the government finds relevant not those twitter finds relevant
technology,not_removed,why are people down voting this post hes not the president hes the president elect you morons
technology,not_removed,not your president he kinda is
technology,not_removed,address what i wrote if you want to make a point dont put words in my mouth
technology,not_removed,incorrect remember whe the white owned businesses refused access to black people
technology,not_removed,onesidedly what else do you propose
technology,not_removed,considering words is probably the most powerful weapon we have that phrase really needs to be reworked
technology,not_removed,your right to free speech is protected from the government not from a private company that hosts your thoughts words at a time what twitter decides to host is completely their prerogative
technology,not_removed,so people should be able to copy hitlers rethoric and say that people should attack various groups they dont like is there really no limit
technology,not_removed,because hitlers propaganda was all perfectly fine right no problem with letting people spew out inflammatory malicious lies
technology,not_removed,well its definitely no safe space if thats what youre trying to say
technology,not_removed,itd be interesting to see what rodentsmasher meant by his comment because to me it reads people would leave because their freedom of speech is being violated my point is that freedom of speech has nothing to do with establishments opting to kick somebody out a lot of people tend to get that wrong
technology,not_removed,recommended you read the for context as well
technology,not_removed,the tweet is certainly troubling she should step down from her post ps blm toronto has no credibility as a civil rights movement if they keep this racist blacksupremacist on their payroll
technology,not_removed,south park was going to they already had in an earlier episode it was comedy centralviacom that censored that one at the last minute
technology,not_removed,
technology,not_removed,twitter doesnt have to hire anyone
technology,not_removed,no not until january
