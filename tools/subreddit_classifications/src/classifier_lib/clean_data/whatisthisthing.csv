whatisthisthing,removed,good catch on the contour lines i didnt bother directly plotting them like you did i see that you are right theyre all pretty much the same elevation the british geological survey dataset ought to include private boreholes and southern water are kind of a grey area because theyre a former government body that was privatised but is still highly regulated and responsible to the authorities because it holds a monopoly on looking after the municipal water supplies for every city in the region i still think its very weird that this wouldnt be listed some boreholes on their map have redactedconfidential on their data this is presumably the private ones of commerical business interest but doesnt include these but maybe their location data is a little out since its from the it might be on a different gb datum than the that all modern online mapping services use maybe this is one of the three boreholes or maybe its relevant equipment positioned nearby in any case i think that plus the fact that ott kempten manufacture groundwater sensors closes our case here likely solved thanks for your input on boreholes never thought of it until your comment

whatisthisthing,removed,boston is inherently closer to the moon meaning its geographical gravitational pull is much greater than the terrain around it so the city must drill into the earth and let out a steady stream of gravity in order to protect the people from crushing gravitational force
whatisthisthing,removed,years ago the hub bearings on lower cost bicycles were grease packed and not perfectly sealed from the elements some of the grease invariably coated the hub and in a short time collected dust which could work its way back into the bearings and cause friction wear not to mention a hellacious noise prior to modern sealed bearing units getting dirt mixed with the bearing grease was the quickest way to wear out we used to grease farm implements after a single days use some had several dozen nipples to locate the leather hub strap was a somewhat effective poor mans solution

whatisthisthing,removed,i dont know but it looks cool af i hope you get an answer
whatisthisthing,removed,yeah looks badass as shit
whatisthisthing,removed,lets take this apart to get a better idea of the period first outside and overall appearance says it was made in the ww ii period but possibly earlier the covering tells me that that is not the original fabric of the chair and its been replaced the carving of the lion and the feet say it was intended as a chair for the head of the table in a dining room as do the arms the chairs for the wife and children wouldnt be as ornate as the chair for the head of the house the rollers on the feet are something that was added later to possibly turn it into an office chair because normally no dining chair would ever have wheels and the fitting look too new the webbing on the underside tells me a pan was removed and replaced with the webbing during a restoration about years ago and likely the original straw or cotton has also been replaced with a more modern material such as some sort of cushion under the current fabric that is more recent oddly it looks like the nails and some staples on the under fabric are from the when i blow them up in an image viewer so that sets it back to just after ww i im sorry i cant identify it for you but i can tell you that the wood has been left intact but the rest of the chair has been through at least two alterations and it probably originated in northern europe or is a good copy made in usa prewar

whatisthisthing,removed,okay so i know a way to tell you what it smells like to find out youre going to need matches the candle a wrench aluminum foil a car battery drain cleaner sandpaper mortar and pestle bleach and an empty gallon container first light the candle you know for ambiance then take the aluminum foil crumble into a ball and rub against sand paper put shaving into mortar and pestle and grind to fine powder set aside next unscrew bleach cap after that pour drain cleaner into gallon bottle these next few steps you have to go quickly dump the aluminum powder into the jug of drain cleaner and close the cap quickly sit on jug then chug the bleach and as you do so bridge the two terminals with the wrench congratulations you just figured out the scent of the candle

whatisthisthing,removed,december for christmas eve for satan ahum santa i mean not a clue
whatisthisthing,removed,i dont have an answer but that is a really coollooking cat
whatisthisthing,removed,aww vesper looks so vulnerable coming out of surgery that blanket is so sweet hope you can find out what it is and it will never again hope he recovers really well
whatisthisthing,removed,its a quarter which is cents and its a common form of currency in the usa
whatisthisthing,removed,i dont know what this is but i upvoted for visibility hopefully someone can figure it out
whatisthisthing,removed,youre going to need to go through you entire house meticulously
whatisthisthing,removed,heres a novel idea just clean up your house cats arent known to just eat random things though but it doesnt make sense that you have to find out what that is so the cat doesnt eat any more remove anything loose and that size also maybe that was in the cat food
whatisthisthing,removed,poor kitty what is it with cats and wanting to eat nonfoods one of our three decided to eat a cellophane cough drop wrapper and we waited nervously to see if any problems developed it produced no ill effects and the vet said if we started seeing breathing problems or the like to bring him in but he acted like he wanted more sorry to hear your kitty had problems
whatisthisthing,removed,looks like a standard american quarter worth dollars check pants pockets and seat cushions for more also it appears you dont own a cat but some sort of bugeyed alien surprised the vet didnt catch it
whatisthisthing,removed,what kind of cat is he
whatisthisthing,removed,its not rats rats are furry creatures whiskers long tail pointy ears and although they get a bad rap they can make good pets
whatisthisthing,removed,looks like a quarter not sure what the other thing is though
whatisthisthing,removed,computer hard drives contain magnets for best results use the ones in your work servers
whatisthisthing,removed,i dont know what it is but that is one ugly cat might i suggest placing the object back in the cat food
whatisthisthing,removed,damn it i thought i got over missing lt dan
whatisthisthing,removed,good god op is nudity really called for here that kitty is naked 😉
whatisthisthing,removed,damn sphynxes they eat everything my exs sphynx would eat anything made of rubber or silicone i have nothing helpful to add about the object but im glad your kitty is ok hes adorable
whatisthisthing,removed,its a quarter check your pockets your kitty went couch diving
whatisthisthing,removed,that doesnt account for the possibility that the cat chewed it off something else
whatisthisthing,removed,get your cat iron suppliments
whatisthisthing,removed,if your cat sticks to the refrigerator door that means they didnt remove the magnet
whatisthisthing,removed,i think its a penny
whatisthisthing,removed,that looks to be a piece of american currency they could be anywhere in your house i suggest getting a metal detector and searching for the rest might be a nickle or a dime not sure am canadian no clue what the hell that other thing is though the third one is a cat
whatisthisthing,removed,its a quarter and a strip for holding a cupboard closed with a strip how did you not know what a quarter was and why did you let your cat eat it obviously im joking about the quarter yes i realize you put it in there for scale
whatisthisthing,removed,thats an essential part of your cat you should never have removed it your warranty is now void and i forsee a malfunction within the coming weeks however do you live in an old house it looks like part of an old electrical switch junction box buzz bar
whatisthisthing,removed,the thing on the left is a razor blade the thing on the right is a quarter
whatisthisthing,removed,i think its a cat but it looks horribly disfigured
whatisthisthing,removed,glad your kitty is ok now
whatisthisthing,removed,your cat doesnt go outside you selfish cruel weirdo
whatisthisthing,removed,cats are dumb
whatisthisthing,removed,so i have nothing constructive to add to your wtf is this quest but i am curious what kind of cat you have my gf and i have been talking about getting a kitty lately and its sort of been shut down because shes gone to an allergist and found out shes allergic to cats is this hairless cat hypoallergenic any suggestions recommendations you can provide on the breed you have

whatisthisthing,removed,as honey gets older it crystallizes and becomes sugar its still safe to eat but its just not honey anymore im pretty sure there are ways to turn it back into honey though
whatisthisthing,removed,a few things could you describe the viscosity is it raw honey is their flavor additives in it snap a pic of the ingredient list just barely out of frame the lighting and the white window sill kinda make it hard to see if their are two different liquids in the jar though honey will sometimes start a sorta crystallization process which will thicken the honey and lighten the color of course this could be an imitation honey which could mean its actually corn syrup with honey flavorings like individual honey packs fast food companies use you have to try really hard to make real honey inedible so i dont think you have anything to worry about if it is hardening up a lot place the jar lid off in a pot of warmhot water for a minute or two and itll liquify again
whatisthisthing,removed,someones clearly parped

whatisthisthing,removed,yup looks like that petite asian girl is the leader of a gang
whatisthisthing,removed,and theres a scary amount of people who think they are giant supermicrophones that the police use to spy on your conversations anywhere in the city
whatisthisthing,removed,washington and boylston is not really that sketchy i mean it isnt cambridge but it isnt south boston either unless something changed drastically in the last years
whatisthisthing,removed,was my costume one year spent the entire night following my buddy hitting him with a plastic spoon
whatisthisthing,removed,i mean that corner has the ritz carlton on one side and the kensington luxury condos on the other and it is whole blocks from the four seasons doesnt get sketchier than that amirite
whatisthisthing,removed,holy shit bro thats the corner of washington st and boylston you do not want to be there between the hours of monday and wednesday tuesday and sunday and on days that end in y oh and definitely not during any bank holidays the chonies will get you man theyll get you good
whatisthisthing,removed,this is exactly what you want to do if you want it to be unfairly taken from you if it were to be real
whatisthisthing,removed,i saw one of these on the closeout shelf at walmart
whatisthisthing,removed,notorious wild duck gang hangout
whatisthisthing,removed,i think maybe they said that because of excess homeless people not shootings
whatisthisthing,removed,ignore everyone giving you shit about the sketchy comment its not sketchy as in youll get shot but its definitely sketchy in you might get offered drugs or a stolen iphone and ive seen one homeless guy smash a bottle over the head of another on that corner
whatisthisthing,removed,did you know eating dolphin brain makes you smarter except the ones that lost their life earnings from gambling
whatisthisthing,removed,would like a word
whatisthisthing,removed,they didnt even spell boston right on the street sign
whatisthisthing,removed,i would have so much fun with those if they had them in my city
whatisthisthing,removed,you turn into a real beautiful conspiracy theory
whatisthisthing,removed,no this person is either extremely sheltered or has never been to some of the very dangerous parts
whatisthisthing,removed,only reason this area is considered sketchy is all the meth heads and junkies coming out of the homeless shelter everything else around here is really nice though the common and a giant movie theater are around the corner
whatisthisthing,removed,there are much worse areas of boston than that intersection where brookline borders with jamaica plains
whatisthisthing,removed,technically i read this as
whatisthisthing,removed,this gets into rmandelaeffect supposedly many people remember things from the past but when they look it up now its different than it was one of them was the ending of we are the champions by queen they say they remember it ending with him saying we are the champions of the world if you look it up on youtube the offical page has it finishing with we are the champions and doesnt end with the of the world part you see videos of people playing vinyl records they bought back then and its the same version on this mandelaeffect subreddit they were mentioning this song but nobody was able to find this version they recall i looked it up and found this obscure video with not many plays seems like it was vhs recorded and you see a watermark people talked about how it might be fake because he sings the same part earlier in the song i have mogg solo multitrack files and the ending is similar to the part earlier but theres piano playing at the end and didnt check if the same thing was earlier theres also the video at the end of him saying it didnt check if the same thing was from earlier this alternate ending version was what i recall hearing on the radio when i was in high school during the last year had made some for a buddy and checked the version and its the same as the official page i figured it was just a remastered cd version didnt notice it before ending that way well whats the proper track name for this alternate ending one then is it on any cds or digital downloads looking up youtube people playing vinyl they bought back then from its the same version as the offical page now where it ends with him saying we are the champions and not of the world people mentioned videos of queen in concert with freddie and he ends it saying of the world like this alternate video version usually bands play live the exact way albums were so why was he ending it this way instead of what the album was ive submitted music videos to music tv stations and you have to supply an audio isrc and a video isrc number when submitting i suspect may have that info for this alternate ending version that may pinpoint precisely what proper name this track is here was a funny video where gwen stefani george clooney julia roberts and james corden are doing car karaoke theyre waiting for it to end like they were used to and it doesnt its this new version

whatisthisthing,removed,this you can buy one for less than online i dont even get the point of this crackhead setup vaping doesnt get you high from vape juice the appeal for most teens is looking cool and blowing big clouds vaping alone with foil and a lighter is not cool and you look like a meth head
whatisthisthing,removed,yeah didnt even card me when i got my first vape

whatisthisthing,removed,close i had just gotten off the toilet and the first flush got most of it down was waiting for the tank to refill and checked reddit after taking the pic i went back into the bathroom to give it a second flush and that is when the overflow happened it was a solid fortunately this meant that the overflow water was clean though i still hosed the room down with some cleaning solution when i cleaned it up
whatisthisthing,removed,experienced pot smoker here why are you people touching your drugs with a plastic lighter that just sounds like a health hazard ive never thought oh i should stick my lighter in the smoking device to pack it down

whatisthisthing,removed,frijoles
whatisthisthing,removed,im gonna go out on a limb here and say bomb
whatisthisthing,removed,it is a tick pinch as close to the head as you can and then twist until it pops off
whatisthisthing,removed,looks like a tick
whatisthisthing,removed,if the part closest to the dog is black its a tick since you dont know what it is im guessing you havent removed a tick before either id recommend getting something like a tick lasso which makes the process super simple and youll learn how much to twist and how hard to pull you can get them at basically any petstore and in most pharmacies once youve used one for a while you can start removing them with just your fingers please be careful though if you do it wrong and the head the black part stays in it could be dangerous to its health in humans its very dangerous for it to stay in can cause lyme disease among other nasty ones

whatisthisthing,removed,i would say that the brass liners would tend to argue for a harder item being measured softer than brass though and also point to a singular specificity of size rather than a lessthan metric this item would most likely be less than about deep at its midsection less than deep overall and not of a dirty nature that would obscure the clearly printed size the fact that this cheat or storystick was made indicates a degree of importance in the manufacture processing finish or setting of an object unlikely to be a tool of procurement as in fishing a quick wiki yields the fact that until the c a possible penalty for falsifying weights and measures in sweden was death which might lend a little cultural impetus toward accuracy in matters of this nature sweden adopted metric in which sets the earliest likely date for this particular item although likely at least a few years later i have not traced the font but that would narrow it down some it is reminiscent of others in the early c all the above coupled with input from upostdarwin suggests a tool that aided the transition to metric in a weights and measurements critical object woodensteins shoes bowls rulers barrels

whatisthisthing,removed,ive seen those combs used for lice maybe his shoes have lice
whatisthisthing,removed,rnoshitsherlock
whatisthisthing,removed,its a gimick because racing cars use nitrogen they use it so there isnt any moisture in the tire to cause large pressure fluxuations as the tire changes temperature this is a nonissue in for pretty much everybodys personal cars but hey its more pro right
whatisthisthing,removed,cause every girls crazy about a sharp dressed man
whatisthisthing,removed,super bowl iii
whatisthisthing,removed,but if you turn it around then itll let all of the air in to the tyres
whatisthisthing,removed,thats for your mustache because you arent allowed to wear shoes like that unless youre sporting a bigass handlebar stache
whatisthisthing,removed,except the tire doesnt allow anywhere close to enough expansion in the other direction to eliminate pressure spikes from bumps

whatisthisthing,removed,maybe idk point is i dont have to search for a gas station with an actual working air compressor and i dont have to have my own air compressor
whatisthisthing,removed,you ever tried blowing a tire up like a swim toy car tires are not all that flexible im sure there is some consistent expansion with the weight of vehicle on them but for a valve to be strong enough to not actuate when you hit a louisiana hwy crater i
whatisthisthing,removed,wow thats gorgeous
whatisthisthing,removed,not sure if the same one but this one is going for on ebay rn

whatisthisthing,removed,my fiancé father worked for the railroad he collected everything we found a giant box of glass insulators he had stored in the garage just the other day my dad said they were valuable i had no clue
whatisthisthing,removed,damnit i knew this one and was too late again im a network engineering student and get really excited about these early telecom artifacts
whatisthisthing,removed,go look for more while you play pokemon go
whatisthisthing,removed,so that was you
whatisthisthing,removed,where did you order those
whatisthisthing,removed,you can make a new little nite lite
whatisthisthing,removed,rgatekeeping
whatisthisthing,removed,you could have just googled the text on it
whatisthisthing,removed,what camera did you use to take this shot
whatisthisthing,removed,i really want to say that its a dog but i guess its actually a glass insulator
whatisthisthing,removed,what shoes are those looks really nice
whatisthisthing,removed,its still probably going to try and kill you everything in australia is
whatisthisthing,removed,more important question why is there a dog growing out of it
whatisthisthing,removed,you hand some over to a person and said person gives you a product or service
whatisthisthing,removed,uh hello rich people troys joining you yes ill hold
whatisthisthing,removed,the is almost certainly the most common glass insulator ever manufactured and used in the united states pretty cool find though
whatisthisthing,removed,im interested where would one go about finding these
whatisthisthing,removed,why are you able to collect so many glass ones and no ceramic ones out of curiosity
whatisthisthing,removed,vash the stampede must have bought it
whatisthisthing,removed,try chewing with your mouth closed
whatisthisthing,removed,did you really need to post that here i googled hemingray and was able to figure out what it was in seconds seems like youre just trying to get easy karma
whatisthisthing,removed,so you can maintain that fuccboi haircut you surely have if you bought these shoes s no seriously though its probably safe to assume almost anyone who buys these shoes has one of those haircuts or a beardmustache to maintain
whatisthisthing,removed,these are australian ones but they do make nice tea candle holders
whatisthisthing,removed,for buying you can go for anywhere from a piece to a hundred of them
whatisthisthing,removed,okay thanks have a good day
whatisthisthing,removed,so that you can be a dapper young man
whatisthisthing,removed,a beard comb with womens shoes lol silly
whatisthisthing,removed,i know this is a loaded question but why do you collect these things this can be asked of anyone who collects anything but this is a very niche item what about it interest you
whatisthisthing,removed,do hipsters flock to you when you wear them
whatisthisthing,removed,possibly fell off a ship while being transported maybe not sure though how something so heavy would have then ended washed up on the beach during a storm maybe
whatisthisthing,removed,i remember using a family members contact solution for two days in a row that used hydrogen peroxide i had no idea there was a special case and i just thought i needed to get used to them i went to work twice with blood red painful eyes until someone told me logic should have told me to stop by the first day but i didnt
whatisthisthing,removed,yeah they are all worth something and the common ones have been selling for a little more now that the crafters have gotten hold of them if you have a drill press and a diamond bit you can sell common ones with a hole drilled in the top fir a piece
whatisthisthing,removed,my dad and i spent a week following an old airial tram line up to an abandoned mine site and collected a bunch of the really small malachite blue telegraph insulators i have them somewhere in storage its so nice to see them still stuck to trees or old power lines every so often
whatisthisthing,removed,its hard to tell from the pics but i think its a ring im sure
whatisthisthing,removed,my mom has a handful of dark purple ones are they worth anything

whatisthisthing,removed,you never know when it comes to older tech i bought a slide viewer at a thrift store the other day and the checkout girl had no idea what it was or what slides were she was only a few years younger than i who am
whatisthisthing,removed,and is the desktop picture
whatisthisthing,removed,shark egg
whatisthisthing,removed,appears to be a reeses peanut butter cup
whatisthisthing,removed,obviously a cell phone holder
whatisthisthing,removed,i think it came from a wild freud
whatisthisthing,removed,as someone who browses rtrees frequently the only thing i can think of when i see this is how sweet of a bong this would make
whatisthisthing,removed,its a plane fart
whatisthisthing,removed,i need a guinea pig
whatisthisthing,removed,not during a fire no
whatisthisthing,removed,do the people trying to fix the new berlin airport know about stuff like this s
whatisthisthing,removed,strange i thought it was an exhaust fan because the color is white but if the colour is white then its probably an extractor fan mater tomato
whatisthisthing,removed,only one way to tell experiment this is an opportunity for science
whatisthisthing,removed,but this is drugs thats different buy an mdma test kit and an lsd test kit put half of one in each test now you have extra units of hopefully now identified drugs which were still sealed come on waste not want not and can enjoy them at your leisure
whatisthisthing,removed,what bomb bag or toy
whatisthisthing,removed,check if it tastes like peaches
whatisthisthing,removed,an adventure
whatisthisthing,removed,does it sound like peaches
whatisthisthing,removed,im sure its chicken
whatisthisthing,removed,im sure its a lwasuit
whatisthisthing,removed,so youre concerned for your childrens safety youve already contacted the company and youre asking the internet yeah ok
whatisthisthing,removed,manometer doo doo doodoodoo manometer doo doo doo doo

whatisthisthing,removed,op please for science
whatisthisthing,removed,what happened to just smoking weed under a bridge with the homies
whatisthisthing,removed,god knows i love alone to paging rnofap
whatisthisthing,removed,looks like someones getting an ass kicking at least i would if my parents found that stuff
whatisthisthing,removed,careful baked potatoes can lead to french fries
whatisthisthing,removed,i will try for science
whatisthisthing,removed,pssst
whatisthisthing,removed,wanna do some knife hits on bowl resin
whatisthisthing,removed,ive heard of that word back when did the i love the show never bothered to look up what it means though
whatisthisthing,removed,im happy for you buddy
whatisthisthing,removed,you raised yourself some top notch white trash
whatisthisthing,removed,no shit sherlock i want to see you try it
whatisthisthing,removed,dont worry
whatisthisthing,removed,sounds like it didnt do much to help you quit if youre resorting to freebasing vape juice
whatisthisthing,removed,freebasing has as much to do with the method of ingestion as it does the chemical makeup of the drug a lot of drugs like cocaine are found in their watersoluble salt forms such as cocaine hydrochloride this cocainehcl salt is pretty soluble in water and you can absorb it by snorting it injecting it eating it or putting it up your bum basically if you put the salt form next to a mucous membrane its going to be absorbed pretty readily the freebase form of cocaine meaning it is a free base of an alkaloid compound as opposed to a salt ia also known as crack and is not effectively absorbed via eating or snorting because it is practically insoluble in water and we dont really absorb anything into our cells unless it is dissolvedsolubilized first the free base version of cocaine crack is however readily absorbed when inhaled via smoke meth and a number of other drugs work the same way freebasing generally refers to smoking the literal free base analog rather than salt of a chemical
whatisthisthing,removed,so you both bought into the bs she told you cool
whatisthisthing,removed,fair enough its a short series on hbo about a guys murder trial and imprisonment give it a shot if you can
whatisthisthing,removed,im a pot head and i dont pack bowls with my lighter i hate carrying a dirty lighter
whatisthisthing,removed,he must of have been a heluva pilot to graze another mans balls with an airplane and not kill the guy
whatisthisthing,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikifreebase
whatisthisthing,removed,wait what did it end up being for
whatisthisthing,removed,yeah you both are gullible as hell op someone who smokes weed would know smoking vape like this wouldnt work well this is all the materials for doing a harder drug as said earlier
whatisthisthing,removed,make her drink the vape juice to prove its not the drugs
whatisthisthing,removed,although people have pointed out that a yo may just be inexperienced that straw immediately suggests free basing vape juice is already convenient to use i see no reason to believe this is harmless tobacco vaping
whatisthisthing,removed,yeah thats all stuff for freebasing drugs i wouldnt be surprised if the vape juice container had been filled with meth china white heroin or cocaine and then mixed with water the container is just to disguise itgive plausible deniability they can then drip that liquid onto the foil to smoke or snort it like a nasal inhaler the piece of wax paper looks like it was used to hold drugs or at least measure them out and you see that black little burn mark on the bottom of the american flag lighter you get that from using the lighters bottom to pack a pipe usually with marijuana but with all the other paraphernalia who knows what drug they were smoking your kid is for sure using drugs i would put money on it
whatisthisthing,removed,i think the vape juice container is filled with something else to freebase and you have been fooled by the container probably cocaine heroin or something equally terrible
whatisthisthing,removed,why are you looking through a year olds room
whatisthisthing,removed,it was more tongue in cheek anyway as in why look up freebasing vape juice when you have the world of information and porn at your fingertips
whatisthisthing,removed,meth and heroin destroy souls
whatisthisthing,removed,thats just called vaping
whatisthisthing,removed,okay apologies although there is a body of people who do say mom as spelled they are often american and it is best to ignore them never do to give them ideas
whatisthisthing,removed,yes most people use american spelling outside the uk
whatisthisthing,removed,id vape it

whatisthisthing,removed,that is a leaf
whatisthisthing,removed,well maybe in some statescountries otherwise they sell things like bongs pipes hemp clothing hemp seed soap and since the explosion of vaping a lot of them have started selling vape supplies for both nicotine and weed

whatisthisthing,removed,suppositories
whatisthisthing,removed,trump university arborist here these are tree rings you can determine the age of a tree by counting these rings the tree in the photo is one year old
whatisthisthing,removed,which is more reasonable and likely to be found in ops yard urban area pest problems or near a kiln and ceramic shop
whatisthisthing,removed,these are possibly kiln poison or maybe rat supports
whatisthisthing,removed,appetizers
whatisthisthing,removed,rfearme
whatisthisthing,removed,yup just take a bite if you break a tooth ceramic if you die poison foolproof
whatisthisthing,removed,what we clearly need is someone who has both killed rats and is a ceramic artist plenty of either here but not one of both but other than that not sure why people think its rat poison when the rat poison is clearly in chunks not long sections as pictured in ops photo
whatisthisthing,removed,one post is enough bro
whatisthisthing,removed,just to point out a determined rat can chew through steel they have some of the strongest jaws of any mammal and very hard teeth true in this case rat poison would be chewier than kiln supports
whatisthisthing,removed,its a really big guitar pick

whatisthisthing,removed,take a bite broken teeth kiln support dead rat poison

whatisthisthing,removed,soits not a regular power recepticle its something that looks exactly like a us power recepticle but a is just testing simple circuit continuity without much actual voltageamperage b has some sort of connectivity to a remote security system so this is all custom designed for that purpose but unsafely looks just like regular ac outlets it seems really weird to design a security system that way especially considering all the other systems for security they could have plus what would be the advantage over an actual locked security line and anchor that someone needs a key for its super easy to defeat this security system and its incredibly easy to disconnect something from the security system youd only want that over say a locked line if people are constantly and legitimately removing stuff lawnmowers and whatnot so you want it to be easy either someone is constantly monitoring every system andor theres some procedure for letting people know that youre legitimately disconnecting something from the system preventing an alarm from going off or someone immediately checking on the equipment otherwise itd be way too easy for someone to say take a lawnmower and be gone before someone notices youd need one of these outlets everywhere or use really long security cables in the case of the pictured outlet what youre attaching to the leg of a single bbq grill or something plus again why make it look like a regular power receptacle whats the purpose from a security standpoint this sounds super inefficient and weird theres plenty of other systems for securing stuff outside simple locked security lines selfalarmed security lines freaking chains and padlocks etc that seem like theyd serve the purpose better this soundsnot right to me

whatisthisthing,removed,if the stories are true in my family i have a great uncle that has one of these and my cousin tracked down the family to give it back and then my uncle refused to give it up so we have two families waiting for my uncle to die of course that is if my family who is rather prone to self aggrandizing our family history at all levels isnt lieing to me again
whatisthisthing,removed,do you know anyplace where they make reproduction guntos i have a friend who has been looking for one that wouldent be an absolute pile of crap

whatisthisthing,removed,its not mexican wrong continent i didnt know what it was but found it by googling its medium approximate age and one of its main iconographic elements want me to give it up or do you wanna try to find it
whatisthisthing,removed,maybe op should figure it out through research instead of being lazy if i am the teacher an i assign a research project i want my students to do the research and find out the response through logical deduction this sub is for curious people not lazy students who dont want to do work
whatisthisthing,removed,cant see for certain but a seems like one of those focus on fancy thing trick questions thats a vhs tape in the back in case he gets uppity
whatisthisthing,removed,lol
whatisthisthing,removed,next time i go to the hospital i hope the doctor wont say that he has no idea what my problem is because he finished medical school asking others for a diagnosis ops teacher showed a puzzling anthropological artifact op will never learn without thinking that was my challenge for op look for what you know deduce what you dont know then you can ask people to confirm your hypothesis
whatisthisthing,removed,i hope you get a cut of the prize
whatisthisthing,removed,i gotcha i just dont like the level of aggression thats being shown towards uzbignich

whatisthisthing,removed,this posting to a forum is technically research
whatisthisthing,removed,looks like that basic white girl tattoo upsidedown
whatisthisthing,removed,so now that you know what it is what did your professor bet you
whatisthisthing,removed,well its hard to be sure with the picture so poorly framed but i think the ancient relic your prof is referring to is called a vhs tape
whatisthisthing,removed,cool but what with it
whatisthisthing,removed,sale table at anthropologie
whatisthisthing,removed,i really hope reddit pulls through here
whatisthisthing,removed,poor professor is so busy studying the past hes not aware of the internet
whatisthisthing,removed,idk but i got a guy that knows everything about these would you mind hanging out while i go get him
whatisthisthing,removed,technology truly is fascinating
whatisthisthing,removed,so op what do you get when you win the bet
whatisthisthing,removed,nice work op please mark this solved
whatisthisthing,removed,its a videotape
whatisthisthing,removed,oh snap looks like the prof is losing that bet
whatisthisthing,removed,if it starts saying feed me seymorerun
whatisthisthing,removed,i bet there was stuff there but they got burned down so now its just grass n shit
whatisthisthing,removed,its a coded message from the slave who packed them
whatisthisthing,removed,cheating is what that is p
whatisthisthing,removed,determined
whatisthisthing,removed,alright op they did your homework please let us know what you win and what the prof says
whatisthisthing,removed,do your own homework op
whatisthisthing,removed,totally a legitimate question s
whatisthisthing,removed,asking on here is really defeating the purpose of the bet the prof is trying to teach you research skills which doesnt really include posting on reddit
whatisthisthing,removed,but he did do his own research he asked people who had done their own research
whatisthisthing,removed,we have a winner i agree
whatisthisthing,removed,your professor either has not heard of the internet or more likely is too lazy to use it and has conned you all into doing this for him
whatisthisthing,removed,god dammit one time i could be useful and someone already beat me to it crap
whatisthisthing,removed,as people have already pointed it out it is an hitit symbol but you can show your prof this httpimgurcomauqzqi if you want
whatisthisthing,removed,they left it on a table by the front door and hung their car keys on them so they wouldnt get lost
whatisthisthing,removed,thanks for the explanation
whatisthisthing,removed,so is the class expecting a nice reward when you win this bet now
whatisthisthing,removed,its a vhs tape i know most college kids these days have never seen one
whatisthisthing,removed,anthropology good look with the job hunt
whatisthisthing,removed,now thats cheating xd
whatisthisthing,removed,if people on the internet figure it out for you does it still count as having figured it out

whatisthisthing,removed,this has nothing to do with anything really but that ebay listing is in vacaville and im delivering a truck down there on friday
whatisthisthing,removed,the location of the hawaiian islands within the north pacific gyre makes it an ideal place for the accumulation of marine debris macro and micro i believe the northwestern islands sit within the convergence zone and are therefore at greater risk when i did my undergrad microplastics was a topic we focused on in detail and the hawaiian islands were often used as a case study sifted through a few sediment samples myself so when i see one the first thing that springs to mind is microplastics
whatisthisthing,removed,kids and his ballnchain

whatisthisthing,removed,amateur ancient coin collector here the interesting thing about ancient coins is that there really are not as many fakescounterfeits as you might think while there are some incredibly valuable ancient coins emperors that ruled for weeks that sort of thing where you have to be extremely wary of forgeries the vast majority of ancient types are relativelycommon meaning that you can get a legitimate century roman coin for the process to make a good forgery the op is a very lowquality forgery is very expensive and time consuming if you want to have a chance of fooling a collector you would have to handcarve dies make your own blanks and strike them all by yourself and you have to be really good at this stuff it simply isnt economically feasible to counterfeit the vast majority of ancient types they are just too cheap already although there are forgeries like the op which fool tourists in rome or something the op is so ludicrously bad to anyone who has held an ancient coin before im not even sure it is meant to be passed off as genuine

whatisthisthing,removed,with that plan only it would be very difficult archaeological plans should have a site code which is an abbreviation of the location and the year the excavation was conducted so there might be something like etc which you could maybe search for on the net

whatisthisthing,removed,it looks a bit like a souvenir item some places have things like these carved by locals from local wood that they sell to tourists theyre great because they bring money in cost very little to make and provide the owner with an authentic item from community wherever it came from
whatisthisthing,removed,as someone who does a lot of wood cutting it certainly could be used as a sawhorse the fact that thing folds up would easily make up for it not being ideally stable it would be stabilised by the log that you put in it the iron hinge would also take the weight of the log putting less strain on the outer wooden parts its just a thought

whatisthisthing,removed,good luck with the ancient indian curse you activated by finding that
whatisthisthing,removed,i guess the only way to know for sure is to dress like a clown and engage in some kind of fetish whilst hovering around the area then all you have to do is is scour the internet for clown porn featuring whatever specific thing you combined it with if you dont find a video of yourself clowning around within a week or so its probably not a camera so youll have to film the whole thing again with your phone or something
whatisthisthing,removed,woman id worry fat old dude meh
whatisthisthing,removed,phew was getting worried there for a sec
whatisthisthing,removed,who are you
whatisthisthing,removed,may i have some for legit purposes i want to create a camera peephole for my front door and one can never have to many cameras
whatisthisthing,removed,can you get a closer picture is there a lens over the front
whatisthisthing,removed,is the front supposed to fall off
whatisthisthing,removed,i call bait
whatisthisthing,removed,to be honest anyone who would want to see a year old man naked is definitely a pervert
whatisthisthing,removed,saving this post so i can follow up on it i sure hope the op doesnt ghost us on this
whatisthisthing,removed,what are you waiting for start sending them to us
whatisthisthing,removed,get with a friend and fake a murder in front of the camera see what happens
whatisthisthing,removed,call the cops and change your locks also if you dont already have one buy a gun
whatisthisthing,removed,lol could be a camera but you took shit pictures that are out of focus
whatisthisthing,removed,
whatisthisthing,removed,could you take a closer picture definitely looks like a camera from this photo but it could be something as innocent as a motion sensor or something would be a good idea to take it apart and see where the wire leads
whatisthisthing,removed,well looks like op will have to take a trip to the attic keep us updated with pics
whatisthisthing,removed,remind me days
whatisthisthing,removed,hey op could you maybe answer some of the questions in the thread to help get an idea of what it is maybe snag more photos seems counter productive to post this and then ghost on us
whatisthisthing,removed,if op doesnt have a tiger kept in his upstairs following the wire cant be that dangerous
whatisthisthing,removed,this post seems fishy op not answering any of these obvious questions extreme lack of detail in the post wtf seriously
whatisthisthing,removed,thats exactly what someone with a spy cam would want us to think
whatisthisthing,removed,maybe she was jexican® mexicanjewish
whatisthisthing,removed,im not positive but if it is a carbon monoxide detector you need to get out of the house possibly call someone to check it out if youre unsure better safe than dead
whatisthisthing,removed,op doesnt like answering questions that dont make it seem more suspicious
whatisthisthing,removed,hours later and no response hmm
whatisthisthing,removed,its a camera
whatisthisthing,removed,so the neighbors can keep a log of when you shit
whatisthisthing,removed,its an ir receiver these can be used to receive discrete infrared commands when controlling rgb led lighting ive used these in the past to control a cable box thats hidden in a closet a good test would be to aim a working tv remote at it sometimes these receivers have a small led that lights up to confirm its receiving commands do you happen to have any accent led undercabinet lighting or a tv in the bathroom key control ir remote controller for rgb led strip lights tonlong dc led switching power supply adapter ir remote controller with receiver for rgb led strip light by tonlong
whatisthisthing,removed,i always check for cameras but people also say im paranoid
whatisthisthing,removed,i really think op is trolling lol
whatisthisthing,removed,oh nothing clearly guns are the solution to any problem
whatisthisthing,removed,op sucks downvote
whatisthisthing,removed,that is a stargate
whatisthisthing,removed,jacking this comment to note op has not responded to any questions we need a few more pictures and for op to answer some things
whatisthisthing,removed,i love that face you make when your pushin one out
whatisthisthing,removed,op can you follow up on what happens in another post im sure everyone is curious to who installed the camera there
whatisthisthing,removed,what state you in where you have to register ownership of the gun cause i betcha dont have to seeing as gun registration is illegal
whatisthisthing,removed,a ruse ring ring hi its the can we have our words clothes and shitty peep holes back
whatisthisthing,removed,he was illegal for her to own a handgun federally you can be and up to own a handgun you just cant purchase one from an fflgun store until youre private sales and gifts are dont know the state so the law might be different

whatisthisthing,removed,viral marketing for a hidden camera company
whatisthisthing,removed,high gain listening device not camera used very frequently in fbi and us marshall investigations are you under investigation for anything more than likely they came and installed it while you were at work perfectly legal with a warrant which is why they dont care if you do happen to notice it because legally its fine for them to install it was probably painted over white to blend it in if its in a bathroom hot steam from shower could have exposed it you probably have one somewhere on the opposite side of the house depending on size they can usually pick up voice about rooms over

whatisthisthing,removed,as an aside older speed radar guns had two tuning forks that cam with the equipment one for low speed mph and different one for highway speed mph you would strike the tuning fork and hold it in front of the working end of the gun and check the readout on the panel police radar operators had to record that they had certified and calibrated the equipment at the start of their shift and make a note in their memo book to that effect jim b

whatisthisthing,removed,warts there are a million things that can be tried both high tech medical cures and folk cures are probably equally effective
whatisthisthing,removed,those would be warts caused by a virus three ways to deal doctor go to a dermatologist and they will freeze cut or laser them off slow diy you can buy over the counter items at drug stores from freeze pens to liquids use duct tape on them or all sorts of options and now for the most metal fast diy this is my personal preferred but uncommon method obtain some lye caustic soda and vinegar fill a shot glass with some water then stir in the lye powderbeads slowly until its a saturated basic solution use the tip of a metal knife or something to drop a single droplet of the lye solution directly on top of the wart let it sit for a minute or two then neutralize the ph with vinegar wash it and scrape the dissolved tissue away repeatedly do this until the whole thing is gone and you go down into your skin a ways making a crater and killing the root of the wart once done stop the bleeding clean add bacitracin and cover with bandage the last method isnt the safest thing in the world but its fast and super effective
whatisthisthing,removed,verruca vulgaris aka common warts caused by a virus in the hpv family by far the most convenient and quickest remedy is freezing used to require a trip to the doctor over the counter remidies are now available in the us anyway idk about other countries liquid remidies are also available but are slow stinky and have varying degrees of success

whatisthisthing,removed,tldr up front its a typetb grenade god knows whats in it because of the stablizer going south dont drop it bud he got it from okinawa right if we take this knowledge and look at the weapons in service at the battle of okinawa april to june we see they had only a few hand grenades in service the and which are comparable to the american pineapple grenades of the time with some elements from the russian grenade the third type is the a lastditch ceramic grenade made of a ceramic or porcelain material given the circumstances i could honestly see them trying to make one out of glass as well however this leaves me with the option the typetb in wwii the japanese used frangible glass containers full of hydrocyanic acid which vaporizes upon its release its a powerful nerve gas that in high concentrations can kill instantly thus it was useful for bunkerclearing however it was seldom used because of the obvious problems of a glass jar full of nerve gas in a warzone they were used right up to the end as they still had them laying around and were willing to use just about anything prussic acid as it was called could be stablized with dissolved copper or arsenic trichloride arsenic trichloride reacts and oxidizes over time with water vapor in the air to generate hydrochloric acid and arsenic oxide as depicted in i think it matches the color of the bottle well i highly highly advise you guys dispose of that very carefully because god knows whats actually in the thing

whatisthisthing,removed,we have a winner
whatisthisthing,removed,not one comment about how those not in police work refer to the thin blue line as the metaphor for cops covering for dirty cops for the line cops wont cross to stand up for whats right out of fear due to the institution of silence about injustice the high rates of spousal abuse the corruption proven in open court the lobbying and protection afforded to police by police and their unions regardless of proof officers were corrupt the moving and shuffling of corrupt cops to other departments and divisions and how thin blue line actually contributes to violence and distrust of police but by all means lets fly a solidarity flag and whitewash away that reality
whatisthisthing,removed,is the flag not a reminder for cop solidarity and has not the thread been littered with repeated info so therefore more contextual info is okay thats not what toplevel comments in this sub are for please read the rules

whatisthisthing,removed,breathtaking example of cargo cult thinking its to keep away dogscatsbirdsflies the rational goes you need water a denser medium which refracts light and something shiny a penny to also reflect some of the light since it will become decoherent and confuse the beast only would really work for flies due to their compound eyes this quite rational idea has been filtered down by people who have no idea why it worked and hence just slung some coins and water in a baggie and hoped httpsenwikipediaorgwikicargocultscience

whatisthisthing,removed,its a clear sign of idiots who believe anything they hear avoid what possible mechanism could there be for a plastic bag with water and a penny it to keep insects away water attracts mosquitoes copper isnt volatile and besides isnt repellant and all of it is in a non porous bag with a very slow release rate of anything including an attractant like water and yes i am an entomologist
whatisthisthing,removed,obviously

whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are bonds but worthless except as collectors items theyre from the period of the article with similar bonds depicted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,currency was hyperinflated a million marks would buy you an egg or a bread roll but yeah they do look like bonds or a similar security possibly interesting as a collectors item since they appear to be in excellent condition but good luck collecting your millions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes thats a million mark treasury bond edit heres a site with some currency conversion tables httpwwwhistoryucsbedufacultymarcuseprojectscurrencyhtm looks like about in may if im figuring right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rtranslator might be helpful if youre interested in an exact translation very cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have any idea of what the currency is though are they marks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have ten of them so yay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,somewhere in my moms basement i have a mark note from the similar situation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,weimar republic era german marks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah probably or so before introduction of the dm currency
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks out of all the research ive done all of the examples seem to skip over for some reason
whatisthisthing,not_removed,foundation of an old cabin timbers either burned or recycled for another building
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no clue but heres for anyone interested
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like the footprint of a shed and grain silo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be that there was a church there with a similar shape to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,located in gold country i first noticed the footprint on google earth of a large manmade structure sitting on top of this ridge at about elevation i visited the site a few weeks ago see pics and discovered that appears to be a bunch of busted up rocks with nothing of interest unfortuately the batteries in my metal detector were dead im heading back out there this weekend with fresh batteries to check it out hoping someone here has an idea as to what it might have been im thinking an old mill or homesteadfarm but the building was destroyed or dismantled years ago the area was populated with miners starting back in the its located in the gravelly range about miles south of virginia city montana so what is this thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey i live in montana where at in the state is this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rather large for a cabin total area is about x i agree its likely the foundation of a homestead and the timbers were recycled there were a few pieces of wood on the ground but none showed evidence of charring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ha ha there are rumors that ol henry hid some of his booty near robbers roost man that would be a find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like there is unfortunately they dont seem to be available online but you could order them i guess kind of a crapshoot since it might be a picture of the same rocks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,northern gravelly range west of varney
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would think youd only bother to build something that large at that height if it made money for you maybe where they sorted tailings and ore
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would require a forest if it was a wooden building any better aerial views what is the geology like in that area any sign the rock has been worked
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the aerial is from google earth the other photos are boots on the ground geology is limestone and tuff in quartzite host rock heres a on a nearby gold prospect
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this it was known as the daly ranch and a popular hangout of plummers bill fairweather one of the discoverers of the alder gulch gold died there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,watchbracelet pin tool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a spring bar remover for watch bands you stick the forked end in between the band and the lug and push it inwards to release the spring bar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a cord holder for larger computer cords
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a latch but i am not sure what it connects to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there any kind of rolling cart in the room it might have a corresponding coupling that latches to that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats kinda what i was thinking but its in such a weird spot for a cord holder especially since it would only hold one and all the other cords are being the desk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,check if theres another nearby desk with a dring or something that would clip into the latch it may be a latchthetablestogether thing like are sometimes seen in conference rooms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good idea but these would be a nightmare to separate if it were
whatisthisthing,not_removed,until the button is pressed theyd be nearly impossible to separate once the button is pressed and held theyd slide apart easily
whatisthisthing,not_removed,except itd be super hard to reach the button youd need a broom handle or something to get between the tables to push it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,appears to connect mainboard to the inductive charging coil and battery flex cable is the common name for cables in electronic that you guessed it flex frequently used for connecting mainboard to another thing cameras batteries displays all the good stuff its a little hard to tell exactly what it connects to but based on the layout battery connector placement and spacing it looks like it goes to the inductive charge coil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the cable connects the power and volume buttons on the side of the phone to the mainboard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you sure all the listings for the cable just say flex ribbon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you have a look on youtube for disassembly of a nexus i can guarantee that someone has made a repair video explaining all the parts as they strip it down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like its from the mens loungewear line by la perla
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have searched the internet for any information regarding this dang bathrobe i want it that much i havent found anything figured id try this sub thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a dopeass robe imdb credits armani for leos clothes but im not getting any hits with vintage armani bathrobe or similar maybe look at the other companies if youre that desperate maybe buy imdbpro and get the contact info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinda looks like a httpsenwikipediaorgwikimacrauchenia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it most appears to be a model of httpsenwikipediaorgwikimacrauchenia a south american genus of ungulate that went extinct during the late pleistocene
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was going to say anteater too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that not one of those chi animals from the phantom menace p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an anteater
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kind of looks like a tapir but more like a macrauchenia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you tried spinning it do the tines vibrate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes but what are the six different length tuning reeds for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if memory serves correct its for demonstrating resonance its known as a tuning fork gyroscope
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry a tuning fork gyro isnt a gyro with a tuning fork bit a tuning fork that can be used as a gyro gyro as in an instrument that measures rotation not the toy top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,obviously ive remembered the wrong name but its definitely for demonstrating resonance this is the only video i could find and its mostly in french
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sounds like it could be httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwaketurbulence
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive heard this before i lived fairly close to dca and i always theorized it was echoing off the houses near me sounded exceptionally alien
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved wow that was fast never heard about it but wikipedia is spot on wake turbulence can occasionally under the right conditions be heard by ground observers on a still day the wake turbulence from heavy jets on landing approach can be heard as a dull roar or whistle this is the strong core of the vortex if the aircraft produces a weaker vortex the breakup will sound like tearing a piece of paper often it is first noticed some seconds after the direct noise of the passing aircraft has diminished the sound then gets louder nevertheless being highly directional wake turbulence sound is easily perceived as originating a considerable distance behind the aircraft its apparent source moving across the sky just as the aircraft did it can persist for seconds or more continually changing timbre sometimes with swishing and cracking notes until it finally dies away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what you hear probably sounds like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that appears to be sap could be infected with blue stain fungus httpsenwikipediaorgwikibluestainfungus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be httpsenwikipediaorgwikibordeauxmixture a fungicide that contains copper the looks damaged the bark is off and someone might have put it on there to prevent the tree from rotting away not very thoroughly done though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this sounds like it thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,since you know what these are this isnt really the right sub perhaps rwhatsthisworth or similar for an appraisal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,since you were years old doesnt help at all if we dont know how old you are now just saying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are no tags on it at all it looks like a sanrio plush but i have no idea of the name of the character it might be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like some kind of soft toy cant be sure puzzling indeed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it actually kind of looks like purin a sanrio character but its not quite right body colour mouth etc maybe its just because of the lidthing on its head
whatisthisthing,not_removed,part of a workbench vice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like part of a clamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my thought exactly i just bought something like this for a collet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or something similar like part of an adjustable guide on a table saw or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,top down view of a cannon thought it was a robot at first lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was your grandfathers that is an engineer badge given in the armed forces
whatisthisthing,not_removed,holy cow amazing that was so fast thank you solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fort sill ok
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i still see a robot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it was a section of the space station
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you may find it a bit interesting that the marine corps has an artillery battalion for training their cannoneers fdc etc the army pays for their training under the arrangement of having staff ncos training the armys officer candidates i trained as a cannoneer in at fort sill there were quite a few barber and massage places right out the main gate that narines and soldiers would frequent
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a bullet hinge meant to be welded onto a heavy door
whatisthisthing,not_removed,great thanks so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aka barrel bullet or teardrop hinges httpwwwwaiteenterprisescombarrelhingehtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is part of the afrocaribbean culturereligion santeria maybe cuban or dominican it is a tribute to eleggua one of the most important orishas you can see the eleggua collar black and red which represent the life and the death the white shells are cauris or cowries shells cowries are often placed in the eyes and the mouth this is a very sophisticated eleggua in cuba they use mostly a dry coconut to represent the head
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess would be that someone wants to get married by the cowrie shells id assume this is near the pacific ocean somewhere probably made by someone of island descent some sort of sympathetic magic of religious offering shinto
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be ifathe african root of santeria cowries are often used as currency in tribal africa the more you decorate yourself and your belongings with the more affluent and powerful your family is the yoruba tribe still practices ifa to this day one of the few in tact unspoiled prechristianity indigenous religions left it led to haitian voodoun and dominicancuban santeria and eventually voodoo as its known in the us a lasting gift from the slave shipsfree labor isnt without a cost if you dance to the music you must pay shango
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im nowhere near the pacific ocean so the cowrie shells are really weird whoever made it is probably an islander its the only shrine of its kind i found in the woods
whatisthisthing,not_removed,omg thanks so much this is so cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those tubes are used in polarimeters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first guess is some sort of sample holding tubes for an analyzer perhaps a spectroscopy or chromatography and the ubiquitous ac adapters for said device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the three black things look like international plug adapters is there a us assuming you are us plug pattern on the opposite side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are the tubes glass can we get a pic of the ends my guess would be part of a vacuum line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those tubes look a bit like acrylicpetg tubes for watercooling a pc but i guess they could be use for a lot of things ftransferring fluids maybe cooling lab equipment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the glass tubes if they are glass kinda resemble for large prograde projectors the bulb i linked goes to an i got last night edit another edit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the ac adapter on the left has australian pins sometimes we get semiassembled plug packs that come with an adapter like this you have to slide the adapter into a slot on the plug pack is it possible there is a plug pack with interchangeable pin plates
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for that we dont even have a polarimeter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we got ahold of the most senior chemist and he said they are tubes for spectroscopy well now we know what they are and that hes a hoarder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are plug adapters but its the type that slots into a plug so you can use the item in many different counties they dont adapt an existing plug just make the one lead that they come with usable on different sockets if that makes sense like this the other bits im not sure of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there a us assuming you are us plug pattern on the opposite side there is not the things came in the same package as the tubes theres two packages with the same things both are not labeled and were sitting in the back of a cabinet i was reorganizing they feel sciencey its just odd that no one in the lab seems to know what they are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can expand on this a bit i recognized these right away these are indosaw education brand advanced polarimetry tubes for their compact quartz polarimeter product id for large one is and the small one is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the plugs are part of a power brick for something when a device is sold in multiple countries they sometimes give you an adaptable power brick it is like a normal power brick except it is missing the parts that stick in the outlet there is a slot on the brick and you slide one of the adapters into the slot to get the correct adapter for your country the brick and the adapter for us plugs is probably in use somewhere and what you have are the leftover parts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow can i just like carry you around in my pocket for when i need obscure tidbits of useful information
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have your pockets got ac i run a bit hot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just style or the quality of the suit i believe that button usually buttons into the triangle through a small hole this one has the regular triangle but has a ribbon loop instead still functions the same it keeps stuff from falling out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess its just a little cover for the button but ive got no idea why its necessary
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an httpsenwikipediaorgwikiammonoidea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone recently gave me this thing as a gift is it a real fossil it looks like a fossil to me but i dont know enough to identify it for certain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agree the modern creature is called this fossil has been partially polished the patterns are called httpwwwdiscoveringfossilscoukammoniteshtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah its real and due to the complexity of the sutures it is probably from the cretaceous post it at rfossilid theres a couple people that hang out there that have pretty good knowledge of them and can probably identify it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,while theyre both cephalopods they belong to different orders that would be analogous to calling a horse a pig or a cat a dog nautiloids are much older evolving in the late cambrian the ammonites first appeared in the jurassic about
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you want rhelpmefind not witt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its seven years old and one of the glass covers broke have been looking for a replacement any help would be appreciated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank youi didnt know about that sub
whatisthisthing,not_removed,close but the opening for the base is too small
whatisthisthing,not_removed,see that little switch on the side it must have a purpose right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it seems to be a shutter guard as explained in this i found
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it is to lock the bolt back open if you dont want to have it latch try it please
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i got this old horn on ebay the seller said it looked like a klaxon horn but there wasnt anything written on it so he couldnt say who made it or when im hoping one of yall can guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe front end looks like it but most pictures show if with a rear cover
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had one that looked like this when i was a teenager i think klaxon is the proper term but we called it an ooooga horn its the kind model ts had on them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks pretty close im really curious to see what it sounds like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what it looks like to me i was planning on giving it a new paint job and im hoping to figure out what it is before i paint it knowing my luck id probably be destroying something rare
whatisthisthing,not_removed,be aware that if its from the model t era it likely was designed to run on volts not i have a similar looking horn and fired it up decades ago it took a rather hefty power supply and drew a surprising amount of current to get it to go aoooga
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i doubt its rare i could be wrong about that but they are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the tip ill try volts first
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just a heads up a volt lantern battery or the like wont cut it you need something that can put out probably or amps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,big brother is always watching nbsp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a smoke and carbon monoxide detector
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess would be not naturally occurring but artificially colored
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first guess would be peridot it could also be a variety of garnet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a tuned circuit inductor and capacitor at a certain frequency it would be resonant so my theory supports the person suggesting theft deterrence
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its for the theft deterrent they set off the alarm at the front door
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a simple electromagnet maybe for a bell or buzzer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it would become one and resonate at a particular frequency when energised by an outside field its a theft deterrent circuit tag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikisandcollar egg masses laid by snails called neverita josephinia in the family naticidae aka moon snails
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the question has been well answered but for home viewers who havent encountered these they arent hard like rubber theyre just sand held together with dry snail slime they hold on their own but break off in plates with gentle effort and turn back to sand if you grind a piece between your fingers a little idk about the exact ones in this picture but in my experience theyre typically about a foot in diameter sometimes you can find cool shit embedded in them since the slime just holds whatever small particles it oozes onto
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i asked this here a couple weeks ago myself ive been on the beaches a lot here and never seen them but this year i see them all over the place wonder if its observation bias or some cycle thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i grew up on west seattle beaches and can confirm moon snale eggs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i grew up in the seattle area and have always wondered what those were
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like turbochargers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely moon snail egg mass but likely not neverita josephinia since the latter is a mediterranean species maybe neverita lewisii would be a closer range fit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im surprised at this answer because these look man made
whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha link was purple from the last time one of these was posted i was pleased that recognised it before reading your answer you really do learn stuff here thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,moon snails while pretty cool they dont really live up to the name
whatisthisthing,not_removed,neat thanks for adding that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reproduction season for moon snails on puget sound is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,baadermeinhof phenomenon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,missed that i edited my post to reflect your better answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,right i am so curious as to their size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre welcome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shells glass trash same kind of stuff you find on a beach anyway just cool to see it as part of a biological structure kind of like those bugs that make their coccoon out of whatever is nearby
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you eat a moon snail should you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its frankly a little pathetic that you couldnt differentiate between neverita josephinia and neverita lewisii from this one photo how do you live with yourself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks about as big as a dinner plate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwpugetsoundeduacademicsacademicresourcesslatermuseumexhibitsmarinepanelmoonsnail tldr of the article they eat clams so they collectconcentrate all the red tide nastiness in their selves
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its difficult at best
whatisthisthing,not_removed,neverita forget
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everyone knows the old saying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this made me laugh harder than i should have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what in gods name is that abomination
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure but the pacific northwest is

whatisthisthing,not_removed,are those geoducks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,geodicks ftfy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre surprisingly tasty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so gooey
whatisthisthing,not_removed,airconditioning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought those were confetti launchers but air conditioners sound like a better answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tshirt cannons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct they only cool a thin layer of air where the people sit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and it will always be the superdome to me or acer at a stretch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if only that would be absolutely magnificent
whatisthisthing,not_removed,synchronized tshirt cannons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,although these are usually used to throw air at a long distance i would have expected displacement grilles for the cool thin layer at very low speed edit fixed the link thanks ubluepsg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have no idea what those are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you sure its a growth looks more like some ants or termites are pushing out the wet material from their nests where you spilled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post this sub is for things not people
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might get an answer here but you should try rwhatisthisfish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like some sort of httpsenwikipediaorgwikitriglidae aka sea robin possibly a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiredgurnard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a juvenile sea robin its in the gurnard family
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sculpin possibly its really difficult to tell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for now marking solved but ill get that second opinion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,red gurnards arent found in the gulf of mexico this heres a sea robin and youre right its in the gurnard family
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks ive seen sea robins in the atlantic northeast but they were different presumably a different species really gorgeous animals
whatisthisthing,not_removed,has more pictures
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe this is obvious but the life part is the life magazine logo exact proportions and the right color allowing for a bit of fading maybe kirkwood iv was a company event like team building exercise edit my best guess is a company event at the kirkwood ski resort which must have opened in the or whats the thing in the upper right a clock tower
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know theres a kirkwood ski resort also i think its costcos generic brand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems to be a clock tower but to me that makes it even more confusing heres a bit more detail httpiimgurcommenpgsvjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,costcos generic brand is kirkland
whatisthisthing,not_removed,stop labeling things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kirkland kirkwood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats just an opinion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its likely just a piece of a shell thats been smoothed down over time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its to dull to be a sharks tooth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be a piece of porcelain from a plate or toilet that got dumped
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope not a tooth smoothed piece of a shell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like sea glass to me edit aka beach glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you cant see it in the picture but the top edge of the tooth and kind of bumpy if it is a shark tooth how do i find out what kind it came from thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but then why does it have abraham lincolns face on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm it could be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the bumpy part is probably the hinge of the clam shell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks similar to a httpsenwikipediaorgwikivaliha but this seems a little larger are the wooden doughnut looking things part of the instrument or just for storage what type of museum is it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the other staff members of the museum are very certain that it is an instrument but cant recall what im not a it even is an instrument but if it is i think it might only be part of one im going to go through records next time im there but the record may only say instrument and nothing specific
whatisthisthing,not_removed,home made fly zapper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the wooden wheel like things make it look larger than it is from what i can tell of valila photos the scale actually seems pretty similar im really not sure i should be at the museum in the next few days so ill check it out some more i thought it was part of the instrument but storage makes more sense small town historical house museum the museum mostly exhibits early history of the area west coast us nearly everything is donations from the community this was in a particular room meant for displaying instruments not original use but current the donations are typically from people donating stuff from family members that have passed away or things they found in the attic that have some relation to the area things arent necessarily vetted so its probable that this doesnt even have a connection to the area why it was on display despite no one knowing exactly what it is i cant tell you edit i looked more at the photo i posted and i think this is a really strong possibility if i can confirm that the wooden side things are for storage or transport this might be it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a oneoff homemade version of a valiha as was mention by taikongniuzai i remember seeing someone in a cafe in nyc play one that he claimed to have built himself the wooden disks assuming that they are hollow may serve as sound chambers to amplify the sound of the strings
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a possibility im not too sure i originally thought the wheels were part of it however used for storageshipping makes a lot more sense next time im there ill check to see if they easily slide off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think this is a definite possibility i couldnt find any photos of a valiha with the wooden things on the side do you think they could really work to amplify the sound
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah think of it as the body of a violin or guitar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eyeglasssunglass clip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just googled deloitte and they have a whole line of this stuff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks for the quick response at this time of night
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you know deloitte is a rather large accounting firm and this is a chotsky type promo thing right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeahi worked at dell we had the same kind of web site for crap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the kind of fastener used to put together prefabricated furniture such as that from ikea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is the hole in the center threaded probably a phillipsposidrive threaded barrel nut
whatisthisthing,not_removed,called a cam
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i couldnt remember that word to save my life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no barrel nut other guy has it right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,specifically a camlock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,appears to be a madeup camera that was supposed to be a polaroid knockoff httpwwwgeocitieswsgabriellemillerusapictureperfecthtml references to the episode in httpwwwgeocitieswsgabriellemillerusakidsstuffhtml refer to the snapmaster
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and the name of the show is if its an episode of a series posting which episode date or nametitle also helps

whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwnavweapscomweaponswamusblockadepicjpg lets hope its not a naval mine best case scenario its a wrecking ball left behind by loggers i think edit could be a bouy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be some sort of ball cock valve but again it begs the question what is it doing in a forest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a lake bouy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an old toilet tank float with the parts at the bottom being where the armrod attaches like in httpswwwplumbingsupplycomtoiletpartshtmlfloatball
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an old toilet float
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be a float but i doubt it because steel does not float
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thatd me my guess too no idea why its in the forest then again forest porn is a thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,then its a bouy lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where do you live that has seasonally underwater forests
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i think its an old rusted bouy but a naval mine is so much more exciting and dangerous httpwwwnavweapscomweaponswamusblockadepicjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,must be from then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was my first thought too httpwwwnavweapscomweaponswamusblockadepicjpg not sure how it would end up in a forest so its probably not one but just in case try not to splode yourself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op says that this part of the forest is underwater seasonally so theres that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,quebec
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a ship but how can they float
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the weight of the water they displace is greater than the weight of the ship

whatisthisthing,not_removed,boglin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jeez i havent seen a boglin in over years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,creepy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a baby boglin httpiimgurcomqjtmgdajpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youre right its definitely smaller than the standard boglin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,god damn those things are creepy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you mention an island sounds to me like the creaks of a dock or some metal construction moving on water whether through wind or over waves used to have a boat dock that would creak like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be orcas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your video isnt a great sound sample sorry but it sounds like a midshipman fish call they can be heard above water on docks or through boat hulls and sometimes will also vocalize while beached or buried above the tide there are a few different species along the west coast and some extend north of the puget sound a better recording or even a longer one would help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what part of what country are you in sounds a bit like a raccoon chattering but very quiet im not familiar enough with opossums to know their vocalizations
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id vote racoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure sounds like a raccoon to me possibly a squirrel but they usually arent very active at night
whatisthisthing,not_removed,southern indiana woodsy area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,soft close mechanism for cupboard doors you drill a hole in the carcase put that in with the plunger facing out and then you have a soft close door
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have one on my trash can its a step can so it keeps the lid from slamming
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as you can see in the pic its about and very light casing and bar is metal top little black piece is plastic its pneumatic of some type it depresses pretty easily with two fingers and pops right back to full length when released numbers are it showed up on the kitchen floor in a brand new house just finished construction three weeks ago we first noticed it the moment a crew came in to install a new fridge but i dont think theyd moved anything at that point thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a likely source ill have to look at them all of the doors and drawers are soft close so it may have fallen out of one ill call it solved solved thanks

whatisthisthing,not_removed,to clarify i would like to know whatwho the statue that is holding the maga hat is i am aware that its a statue of someone possibly a solder since it seems to have tall boots
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you not a great way to treat a gift
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow you can really tell by the look on his face use of it as a hat rack he really dislikes that statue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,makes me really miss obama days loved the candid photos of them all through the years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,trying to fabricate some ammo so you can dis the prez huh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not a great way to treat a gift
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not fabricating anything this image is dan scavinos header on twitter he tweets for the potus account
whatisthisthing,not_removed,snail babies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like its from a bb or pellet from an airgun maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,almost definitely a bb used to see these in the windows of my old elementary schools
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bb or hole more likely bb
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely bb gun shot i have a old post about some hooligans did that in our neighborhood also
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the hole is on the outside and theres a screen too between the outside world and the glass the screen has almost no damage sometimes there are high winds could it be hail or a rock somehow picked up from the top of a roof in high winds small circular hole on outside of window on the other side is the exploding circular pattern window is swung open in photo so i could snap the photo it is double paned glass i guess thats the correct term some air gap between sheets of thick glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks an awful lot like a bullet hole to me but i suppose it could be from hail depending on how bad the weather gets there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unfortunately it happened a while ago bird would be gone by now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nothing there except shards since it didnt pierce the screen that stands between the window and the outside world it couldnt have stayed inside anyhow must have bounced back outside i mean technically never came inside just enough to hit the glass with force to make the mark
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bbs dont often have enough inertiaforce to actually penetrate window glass what happens is the bb ricochets and the impact blows out a circular wedge the bb flies off in another direction leaving the shards in between the glass and screen source i owned a bb gun and shot broken windows as a kid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your image upload failed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im getting a on that link more info please
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hopefully this upload works better
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a double mijwiz its an egyptian reed instrument httpwwwmusicalinstrumenthavencomdoublemijwizaspx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a prop from the prop room maybe custom fabbed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lacons basically a troglodyte trying to appear to be an aesthete if you look at the shots in his office in whitehall his desk and mantelpiece are covered with random objets dart i dont think any of them are meant to be authentic or identifiable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah i wondered if it was a real based on a piece from the year of the films setting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting i hadnt noticed the desk but totally agree the guy is a complete arse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,russian leaders lr gorbachev khrushchev brezhnev stalin trotsky i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the leaders of the soviet union from right to left lenin stalin brezhnev gorbachev the unknown person is not khrushchev because he was before brezhnev not after it doesnt look much like either of the two persons in between brezhnev and gorbachev namely andropov and chernenko but its probably supposed to be chernenko as andropov wore glasses the man on the far right is absolutely lenin and not trotsky who had a full head of wavy hair that he wore as a big puff on top of his head and also he wasnt the leader of the soviet union lenin was bald trotsky wore glasses in fact the image of lenin is the best likeness of any of the set the others are all pretty bad stalin is recognisable by his thick moustache and brezhnev has his characteristic enormous eyebrows gorbachev has the birthmark on his forehead and the sash that says perestroika
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that makes the guy between him and gorbchev either or given the elegant eyebrows id say chernenko but as a child of the cold war im disappointed theres no khrushchev
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup definitely source parents have the same one pretty sure time period was late or early
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would think lenin would be more likely than trotsky
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely gorbachev because it even has that characteristic birthmark on the forehead although its nearly out of sight because of the viewing angle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh yeah definitely lenin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those look like the things you hammer into the ground and they protect your garden beds from the hose when you drag it around to water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are iron come in a smaller size than this and the two disc shaped parts are different sizes with the smaller one at the top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very large orange juicers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably a httpsenwikipediaorgwikibollard of sorts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre part of the deck rigging on ships they are designed so that you can throw a loop of rope over them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look like fence post tops large ones for tall fence corner posts i cant find an example but im sure ive seen ones like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,boot scraper theyre always boot scrapers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you not see the wagon behind them these are not hose guides way too big
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely look like hose guides
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they would be enormous thats a wagon behind them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe its a small wagon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my grandparents house had ones just as large but had a more ornate design
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some fences are enormous especially corner posts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would be impressive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could that be a very large collection of thorn wood carvings from the yoruba nigeria
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most of them are broken so im starting to put them together now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i really dont know looking it up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id hold off until you know exactly what they are and how to best conserve or repair them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre all held together with wood glue or hot glue im repairing the ones that are obvious big headless one and some others
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hot glue tells us theyre not super old seems like they may have been the result of a wood carving hobby
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what im leaning towards as well she says they were a gift but really has no idea what else may be nothing more than that but even if thats the case id be fine with it theyre neat and i like puzzles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can buy a version for about twenty quid at agricultural supply companies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shepherds crookstill used today
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as people have already said its a shepherds crook you might have been searching for the word httpsenwikipediaorgwikicrozier which is a staff in the shape of a crook that bishops of many churches carry as a sign of their office
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you solved your own question httpwwwhabsburgernetenchapterdoubleheadedeagleomnipresentemblemhabsburgslanguagede
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its holding a sword and orb so this is the double eagle of thehttpsenwikipediaorgwikigreekorthodoxchurchmediafileflagofthegreekorthodoxchurchsvg there are other versions like the austrian version is holding sword sceptre in one foot and orb in the other you also see versions with two swords cross and orb scepter and orb empty talons etc sword in one and orb in the other is greek orthodox
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the double headed eagle is supposedly one of the oldest symbols used it is thought to be a symbol of invincibility loads of countries and houses adopted it and copied it to use in their own arms russia france denmark germany spain etc the romanovs habsburgs holy roman empire etc i wish i could be more helpful can you show a picture of the back that might help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a natural gas radiant heater it uses ceramic elements almost certainly this one is nonfunctional
whatisthisthing,not_removed,old electricceramic wall heater
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those were popular when i was a youngster discontinued for the same reasons you never use a camp stove in a tent hazardous devices indeed sigh im old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had a suspicion that it was some type of heating appliance i just have never seen something like this does it just warm the room its in or how does it work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely a gas heater
whatisthisthing,not_removed,radiant heaters work by heating up whatever is close to them they produce much more infrared heat than they do hot air a wholehouse furnace might produce virtually nothing but hot air this device works more like a heat lamp than anything else
whatisthisthing,not_removed,trout probably farm raised rainbow they tend to lack color spread the fins out and check the httpwwwdiamondghostcharterscomidentifyingsalmonandtrouthtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,trout
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like branzino
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably farm raised rainbow yup thats spot on i use to work in meatseafood and sold the gutted dressed version
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not a whale its a basking shark the rostrum of the chondrocranium is in the foreground if it was a whale the jaws would extend past the rostrum but that is obviously not the case it doesnt look decayed enough to have lost huge body parts like that yet the palatoquadrate of basking sharks terminates far posterior to the rostrum additionally the smoothed nondiscrete edges of the skeleton point to chondrification rather than the heavier ossification that would be seen in a whale sorry im on mobile so i cant link but googling basking shark palatoquadrate or basking shark chondrocranium can show you what were looking at in the foreground my guess is basking shark but in iceland it could easily be greenland shark edit i just noticed the lateral fin sure its shark and not whale to the left of the picture we can see the radials of the right metapterygium edit just noticed the gill rakers its a basking shark not a greenland shark
whatisthisthing,not_removed,banana is missing but seriously it looks like a decomposed whale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dead whale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a greenland shark to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a blue whale the brush like teeth towards the front of the picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bony somewhat segmented look could be a decomposed sturgeon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can see where it might be easy to mistake the gill rakers for baleen too looks like its well on its way toward turning into hakarl though ubulletm lucky you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thanks ill forward this along sweet detective work likely solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol you need a greenland shark for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks just like the un building taken from the east river or across it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,according to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey awesome thanks thats where i bought it haha had it in storage and just put it back up thanks my brother in law was asking last night and i felt kind of silly not knowing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well i may be wrong but i dont think thats miami i used to live in downtown miami and spent several years working on the water there check this image of the un bldg from the east river httpiimgurcommusuqyfjpg quick gif i made httpiimgurcomqusngxkgif ill happily stand corrected but im thinking thats nyc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a good catch id have to agree with you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,considering what walmart pays their employees i am not surprised they goofed that is pretty irrefutable thanks for the correction watson good work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,on closer look its definitely the un building you can clearly make out the satellite dish to the lower left of the building in both images for some reason ops image has the chrysler building removed but everything else looks the same
whatisthisthing,not_removed,appears they were part of a edit the bp stands for britannia plate which i assume means its silver plated httpsenwikipediaorgwikibritanniametal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its camping kit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are normally called campaign cutlery because they were used by the military when on campaigns
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it should probably have ropes attached and be used to carry things like large round vessels
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a decorative cross to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it might be so people can carry something heavy either a pale of water or some logs or something definitely doesnt look like its to be operated by one person
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it a basket for fireplace logs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,like a wine barrel maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont have an upbox but from the shape of the part and appearance of the one i found im thinking it clips into the filament holder and allows you to use full rolls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so you checked the manual and asked upbox right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nothing in the manual only had bad experiences with upbox support
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im thinking that this is the mythological creature krampus in contrast with santa clause who rewards children with presents for the good behavior throughout the year krampus punishes them for their misbehavior
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just looks like a generic demon to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like crocodile werewolf with horns
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hi rwhatisthisthing doesnt normally do brand questions id check for the appropriate simple questionsstyle thread in rmalefashionadvice or rfemalefashionadvice depending and ask there good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for some reason not all pictures are loading for me phone i would guess eva foam though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more info both are fairly small fit into the palm of a hand used in packaging of smallish parts from chinai believe as part of the standard packagingnot extra foam for shipping each is about inch thick i cant find a decent match on amazon just by appearance so im trying to get an actual name of the foam type to help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,only red pic showing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it rigid or bendable if its rigid its some type of closed cell foam
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the pics did load for me albeit slowlythanks imgur and youre correct cheap mediumtolow density eva probably laser cut
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no problem i often use this to make props from games and movies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the design looks brutalist to me if theyre signed they might go for decent money i have sold some guy vidal canadian brutalist designer earrings for before that being said i dont like the design of these that much though it might just be the photo lighting so i doubt theyre by a renown designer but you never know look for marks or symbols on the back edit if theyre run of the mill unsigned you could be able to market them as brutalist and sell them on etsy for each that would require some nice photography though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,refrain from reading the necronomicon while wearing those
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look a little like the monster energy drink emblem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think that they are just jewelry that was made by some craftsperson i dont think it has any meaning other than to look the way it does
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reminds me of diablo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,soundgarden rusty cage comes to mind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats exactly what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill check the back but will also keep the piece for sentimental reasons way more my style than hers but thanks for the infotips
whatisthisthing,not_removed,brutalist designer ive never heard of brutalist before after a google i gotta say i like that style ive definitely seen that kinda stuff before but never knew the terminology neat thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill do my best but the temptation is strong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,monster was my first thought
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you wear them upside down the devil laughs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone doesnt like the hell vibe we are getting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whoa thanks what a strange choice for my grandma
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh cool yeah it looks better with a white background though those photos arent that great either imo i wouldnt say these are his best designs but maybe op can still get each with good photos and etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,til that ugly concrete block building at my university that is supposed to have won some architecture awards is brutalist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats because it adds nothing to the discussion and is unhelpful read the sidebar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,she was probably young once p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,even though you dont like the design its not objectively bad ops grandma liked it doesnt mean its a bad design you just dont like it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,extremely probable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aww thanks for speaking up ❤️
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure but there are designs that are more valuable on the market thats a objective fact from my experience these designs arent worth premium money some more currently desirable fashionable pieces go for or more thats not saying that these are bad but theyre just not as desirable as other vidal works proof of differing values of vidals work ebay sold from highest to lowest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no problem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right about different styles being priced differently but to be fair op didnt ask about the items worth hammering the point home that ops dead grandmothers style wasnt the best is a bit shitty to say the least
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as mentioned above im keeping it for sentimental reasons what its worth on ebay after better photography doesnt matter to me that my grandma had this wacky neat thing in her jewelry box does so priceless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah honestly when i commented i thought i was on rwhatisthisworth i wouldnt have made nearly as big a deal about it if i knew it was rwhatisthisthing the downvotes made a bit more sense when i noticed that this is the first time i mixed them up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah sorry i thought i was commenting on a rwhatisthisworth post i wouldnt have talked about the value so much if i had noticed it was actually on rwhatisthisthing much different context sorry about your grandma
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your grandma was a cool kid in her day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i appreciate the explanation makes total sense in that context so no worries i appreciate the kindness as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a simunition httpsimunitioncomenproductsfxmarkingcartridges
whatisthisthing,not_removed,firing the round causes the white piece to spring forward cycling the weapon you get the feel of a weapon being fired without any primer or gunpowder residue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep used similar ones on various exercises usually with blue tips tho
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a primer and propellant are still used they actually fire a little paintball like pellet httpsimunitioncomen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so theyre basically advanced snap caps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the fx marking cartridges fire a marking projectile the ones shown in the op the securiblank rounds do not all they do is cycle the weapon go to simunitioncomen and watch the video
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikimeturaelongatus or its empty case cocoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bingo thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty interesting that on top of that silken enclosure they start to add small twigs therefore making it look like an extension of the tree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just so you know op these things can totally decimate a large evergreen tree in one season do you notice any brown branches on your trees you may want to check and remove as many cocoons as you can there is a live worm inside so be sure to step on the cocoon or otherwise kill the worm after removal there are also pesticides you can spray to kill them if you want to take that route
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeahsly little they are the ones on evergreen trees are covered with pine needles and you can hardly even see them until the needles turn brown
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats some serious destruction in just one season
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes it certainly appears to be part of a stereo microscope nippon kogaku is mostly known as nikon today and they still make all types of lens products
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes its a stereo microscope in order to be functional however it needs a stand unlike cheaper scopes these higherend scopes arent one piece like a traditional high school microscope they come with a head as in your photo and a separate stand a stand is sometimes more expensive than the scope itself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks very much guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a half chewed up bully stick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i suspect a bully stick as well almost
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a rawhide bone for dogs to chew on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,honestly it looks like a rawhide dog bone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bottom picture is the before and top pic is after its shrinking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,general location where you live does it have a smell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree with looks like tree sap try cutting it bending it what does it smell like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dried sap from a tree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree especially the bottom pic if one is outside in the elements i bet it would look like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i that a httpwwwbestbullystickscomwhatarebullysticks just happens to be a bulls pizzle fyi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wondered what my dog did with it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be an animal leg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,middle tennessee no smell but it is chilled being outside no bugs on it ever but it is winter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cant detect a smell its very hard when bent it bends at one of the cracks but is stuck on the center part which is fibrous
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its translucent and there is no bone unless the black line through the middle is a bone that seems too small though

whatisthisthing,not_removed,fiero i like to call it the car that could have been nice looks and fun to drive but what a piece of shit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not really a car its a faux body wrapped around a mediocre donor chassis the mindset of anyone buying such a thing i cannot fathom i could be underestimating the engineering wonder that it represents if so please accept my apology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im pretty sure that this is an httpsenwikipediaorgwikiexcaliburautomobile it is a sort of boutique car that has been built on various chasis and with various engines over the years the company has closed and been resurected several times
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or a replica of their golden spirit a mitsuoka le seyde seriously theres a ton of cars that look like this and they all are copies of each other
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not a zimmer look at the lines and trim closely its not the same
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe youre on the right track with a diy kit car but i dont think its a fiero base the doors and unmodified sections lines are not correct

whatisthisthing,not_removed,try holding a flashlight at various angles and viewing at various angles a black light might help too you can sometimes read stuff like this if you get it wet but be careful to not wipe it off be sure to figure out some good permanent way to mark it down to record it again if you figure it out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im going to guess that its upside down and its disclaimer i am not a bot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have the manual what model car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool well do you see the pattern i saw that made me guess that i mean we dont even know for sure where the numbers are let alone what they are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what model car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe thats from a glassonly picture frame mine is from ikea like one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a picture frame clip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,brakes or air filter housing is my guess more than likely air filter housing though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a frame clip for a glass and back frameless frame im a picture framer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be from the car post fords are all clips ford guy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a brake pad clip to me keeps the brake pad in place and often get replaced on a brake job
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes i think from the clips series of ikea frames actually

whatisthisthing,not_removed,free france forces had a port in point noire congo the lettering matches what the french were using at the time especially the number online english sources on the internet are kinda thin though that size would match a few light destroyer classes built after so its kinda hard to be sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats in india right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone just posted here a few weeks ago about a small african nations single boat navy that had two until one sunklet me see if i can find it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we estimate it to be m but its hard to know for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that really looks like it though you cannot find any information on where they were discarded or if they were sold to anyone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you win todays meta award i mean what are the odds of post being this relevant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope its about nautical miles off the coast of the republic of congo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimurotoclasscollier sunk in the pacific ocean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,different ship those were wwiera colliers the ones im talking about were coast guard vessels and literally the only information ive been able to find on them is that navypedia link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so far the guesses around here is that its an era british patrol boat due to the design of the or a shanghai class patrol boat because the design is very similar at least some of the designs that were sold off to other countries and prc the congo next door have had up to six of those in active service the problem is that its near impossible to find any sources that describe any battles or sinkings in this area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the booklet from the magical mystery tour
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct its a photobook of the magical mystery tour movie making that came with the magical mystery tour album
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwidtechproductscomidtechintroducesnewsecurekeymseriesencryptedkeypads yes its what it says on the tin a card reader
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so if i want to sell a bar of candy to my friend i plug it in and scan his card and voila
whatisthisthing,not_removed,typically with readers like that you need service with a bank that processes the cards and it is typically not very cheap go get a free square reader if thats your goal p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah thanks so should i sell it or is it not worth my time p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cant hurt since it looks new they popped up as about a hundred bucks when i googled it cant hurt to try and get bucks or something probably towards the lower end since its a specific purpose someone would have to have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a small permanently attached mini flag pole mount see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i learn the most interesting yet useless information on this sub its my favorite sub
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks man that seems to be it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,another of these was just posted in the last few days as well its funny how often that happens not counting the usual things that are probably on the fat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,taka coin from bangladesh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiazteccalendarstone aka sun stone i cant comment on the value of your items but this symbol is abundantly found on mexican souvenirs the plaque on your first item says it is a reproduction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aka mayan calendar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are different but aztec is somewhat based on the mayan aztecs came much later than the maya however they are two distinct things and the names are not interchangeable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i understand that it is much more accurate to say that its an aztec calendar but do a google image search for mayan calendar and tell me that ops symbol isnt also known as a mayan calendar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right the first result i get for mayan calendar is actually the aztec one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fabulous ipod flashback i have one just like it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gnawed by rodents
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting we dont eat pork at our house wonder where it came from thanks

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thars a bear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a bear hide to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from the silky look of the hair id guess perhaps a goat bears in my experience have fur that is much thicker and coarser but its hard to tell from just photos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no question its a black bear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rottweiler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i see the shoes on the side now yea i think youre safe probably a bear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the other side of the cover is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rhelpmefind perhaps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved its the jessica adams spa retreat set with mykonos print
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no idea about the nubbin but theyre whered you get them any chance theyre just factory screwups that were discarded somewhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think those are pilsner glasses for beer i cant see the glass nubbin on the bottom but they could be factory seconds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant see an nubbin anywhere but often champagne glasses have some sort of etching at the bottom so there is a place to let the bubbles form perhaps that is this nubbins function for the beer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these look like seconds since they vary in the size of the base and the thickness of the stem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,different types of beers have different types of glassware httpiimgurcomkgoidgwjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this isnt really a whatisthisthing type post try rfurniture or rhelpmefind or rwherecanibuythis
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i vote for deformed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it almost looks like a spider crab i know crabs can regrow their claws if they lose them but it looks like the entire back half was gnawed on and its starting to regrow which would explain the deformity in the back just my thoughts here is the link httpsenwikipediaorgwikihyascoarctatus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thought it was diseased at first but maybe a species of httpsenwikipediaorgwikidecoratorcrab
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what body of water was the crayfish pot in that would be helpful to figure out what crab this is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my vote is on spider crab as well maybe juvenile with missing extremities
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how far from here httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiringhalsnuclearpowerplant was it caught in the cooling water outflow pond
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an israeli army service decoration called the operational service decoration unofficially is usually referred to as a pazgaz
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought was its a star wars pin some sort of take on the rebel alliancenew republic logo like a squadron or something i dont see a matching one on a basic image search maybe some video game or from a fantasy series a sword and a flame or flaming swords are common fantasy themes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,guardians of the galaxy pin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow i thought you were joking but youre right httpwwwisraelidecorationsnetidfcampaignribbonshtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure why reddit didnt notify me you replied when you did and just decided to now but thank you i spent some time in israel and i think it was given to me by a friend this was years ago so i guess i just didnt remember thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,funny star wars is also what came to mind for me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks any chance to identity the logo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not a symbol just a design
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know but you have beautiful skin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess would be httpsenwikipediaorgwikicharcoalpile
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a kiln probably making either charcoal or pottery there is a slow smoldering fire inside that can burn for many hours or even days check out the primitive technology youtube channel to see him building an example
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i found it exactly it was completely conical symmetrical without any doors or openings although the place is within a thick pineoak forest there was evidence of logging in the surrounding area the thing was apparently burning on the inside as it was emanating fumes and heat it was probably some kind of furnace but what could have been inside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep seems like it thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it seems you have come across the rare fancy moustache in its natural habitat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a tool you use when you install satellitedishes it helps you finetune the positioning of the dish for optimal reception its a pretty fancy one at that

whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont feel bad man i had exactly the same problem a while back ended up asking rbdsm p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive always just called it an double ended dog clip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someones exploring bondage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,horse people use these for everything edit though ive never heard anyone call them anything other than clips
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its known as double ended bolt snap by divers at least or commonly just double ender by no means the only use but its very common among divers especially technical divers to hang all kinds of stuff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more accurately its called a snap hook
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the uk it is a double ended bolt snap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can find them in two sizes in most home depo stores bought one last week was on rack above head height
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are used commonly in the dog world to clip metal water bowls to the sides of crates
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you need one go to the scuba shop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,woah man at least tag it with trigger warning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,stateside theyre called doubleend snap bolts sometimes bolt snaps but yep thats the thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not to be confused with a carabiner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also commonly referred to in some industries as dog clips
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so the name is just its description
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this was my first thought too oooh these would be much better than the clips i currently use for my cuffs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ask for a snap to someone with horses and this is what they will hand you put on water buckets feed buckets hold gate shut hold webings on the front of the stall and anything else you can think of w go through a hundred or so of these a year
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep bolt snap is what ive always heard them called and seen them sold as too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwbkrengcompcatgifsproductssmallsnaphookforropejpg the kind the op posted is a trigger hook
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when i hear snap hook i think of something where the spring opening gate rotates on a pin instead of retracting probably splitting hairs though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as is the case with a lot of things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,boy i bet you have a hard time with fireplace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was kinda inspired by the reason i needed one also your username has made me realise that i need a czechoslovakian friend so badly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes that is why i follow the sub to learn about the hardware yes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mouse right whatever you do wash your hands afterwards
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i see that you are into the kinky kind of mouse sex
whatisthisthing,not_removed,leg irons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fire place
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinda my point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that may or may not be the reason i needed it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gnome saying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant think of a single other example actually
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont think so i just know even less than i thought about global politics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,useful for quickly connecting wristankle cuffs to things too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had no idea the official name of france was the french republic til
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wouldnt the adjective still be czech though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in spanish is república checa would still be the same
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyve been going through waves of that ever since the split
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought most czechs hated the new name and besides isnt the adjective still czech anyway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i need some fuzzy heart shaped ones gnome saying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mail box
whatisthisthing,not_removed,light blub
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the german word for bra means bust holder but then german has a lot of words like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,facewash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,glove compartment fun fact a century ago when cars were still a new thing drivers wore gloves to keep their hands clean as they did with riding horses as cars evolved the need for gloves died out but that little box stayed useful it kept the name
whatisthisthing,not_removed,toaster
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dish washer door handle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a fresher im going on break
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to be fair its not really a shared language there are a lot of similarities but they are two quite distinct languages with a lot of entirely separate lexical items and different grammar eg czech has grammatical cases and slovak only has
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes czechs cant understand slovak but slovaks can understand czechs it boggles the mind since the languages are so similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mmm blubs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,isnt the german word for glove hand shoe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fingerspitzfuhl if i recall correctly from a book that told me it is that fingertip feeling or what english speakers would call being in the zone that meditative state of pure concentration where your body and your mind are working perfectly in harmony for the desired end result
whatisthisthing,not_removed,um excuse me but the need for gloves is still pertinent in modern badassery which includes driving cars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the only way i would have picked up this information would have been by watching eurovision apparently it did not register
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think theyre called bonbons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my favorite is raccoon wash bear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also living in subzero winter climates driving barehanded is like holding onto icicles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the string back gives you a bit of extra purchase
whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha well i cant argue with that sentiment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you just need a better steering wheel or a nice cover for it i had a steering wheel that was sort of velvety and it was great in the winter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my understanding is that they generally do could just be us brits whining about losing every year
whatisthisthing,not_removed,velella
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some sort of sea glass

whatisthisthing,not_removed,used to find those all the time when i was growing up in washington theyre also known as bythewindsailors as they have a fin that sticks up when they are floating on the surface to catch the wind for moving around if the wind shifts inland hundreds of them can become beached and article from natgeo on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you guys so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im counting at least there depending on the strenght it can be a hell of a ride maybe just ask him if he knows how to take care while on acid and offer him to ask for advice if he doesnt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also depending how close you guys are you could always be his sitter i tripped on shrooms my first time around really close friends and just having that helped me have a good trip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not a trip a hit and or of them but yea just leave it shits expensive and hell be fine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you so can i ask you what i should do is this especially dangerous or something my brother is years old should i just put it back and forget about it or could it be dangerous for him
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that isnt enough lsd to do much more than trip balls for a few hours the amount required for an actual overdose would blow your mind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh and dont touch it with your bare hands unless youre looking to get schwifty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should eat it with him and have one of the greatest experiences of your life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,alrighty thanks i never did anything besides weed guess ill just put it back and let him have his fun
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really you kids missed out on the real stuff two and a half hits would have been plenty for an average person maybe too much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,two hits of blotter is all it took for me to need to leave my last grateful dead show early that was also my final trip soldier field chicago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,strength is variable a single tab might be meh or might be an almighty trip but you cannot physically overdose on acid and there are limits to how high your brain can actually go when all the molecular receptors are saturated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey as long as it isnt really dangerous or anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it does say ammunition factory karlsruhe around the center part might help you out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what are the dimensions it looks very similar to the imperial german shell casing about a quarter of the way down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly a shell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is the diameter at the mouth of the case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it would help to know the diameter of the shell at the other end to work out the diameter of the projectile from that information working out the gun becomes a lot easier
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely imperial german and prewwi too that might be worth something on the collectors market the imperial german army had a also there was a both of those guns were developed during the war and your case is dated so that neither of those may be right edited ok a german gun that was developed in this might be it and a variant of the previous gun that had a a longer barrel but looks to have fired the same shell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so i just noticed the stamp a did a little googling i found googletranslated from spanish that says it was for the krupp argentine model field gun lots of info and pictures i then googled for the shell casing dimensions for the and found it doesnt specifically say its for the but the dimensions are just about spoton with yours other than the artistic embellishments does this look like your case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you also say below that the diameter of the case at the mouth was cm and the was a mm gun a very popular caliber in a few countries militaries at the time

whatisthisthing,not_removed,nicely done you just saved me hours of fruitless obsession
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how did it get the sky right

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a standard possibly a convertible the wings are different but cars then were coachbuilt so that might be why httpsenwikipediaorgwikistandardmotorcompany
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to piggyback ubweebar i think its a standard tickford body convertible same grilled lights and engine vents near as i can tell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,picture taken in england a long time ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks really close
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you look at the number plate it looks like dyn which is the car i linked in my other posts i did find a coachbuilt by tickford which is close but there are differences the rounding on the bottom corners of the windscreen for example
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youll likely get an answer without it but if you could narrow down a long time ago you may get one quicker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perhaps a bit closer standard flying light twelve drophead coupé
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same car better angle im with you it looks like the unmodified standard flying drophead rather than the tickford i said before the only thing that is really throwing me is the circle b emblem in the grille everything else matches perfectly the other have a in that spot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id love to provide a year but i dont actually know ive asked the baby in the photo but hes in england currently
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats very close the only difference is the emblem under the hood ornament anyhow since the car in the photo also has an aa emblem on the grille that may have been an aftermarket addition
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the current owner of dyn is the owner of the standard motor club website and believes it to be a factory prototype which could account for the different logos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he just replied
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think ops logo is the one on this page there are apparently only of these cars left today so there arent many pictures online only one i can find is dyn edit and aa means automobile association very common to see aa and rac badges on vintage cars httpswwwgooglecouksearchqaabadgesourcelnmstbmisch httpswwwgooglecouksearchqracbadgesourcelnmstbmisch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nice find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rhelpmefind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm this is a little more challenging than i would have guessed anyway i would call it a slotted spoonula but searching on that and any other search terms i could think of didnt return this item now spoonula is a real thing and if youre not averse to doing some modification you could either buy a hardy slotted spoon and blunt the front edge so it works as a spatulaturner as well or you get a spoonula and slot it yourself with a dremel or something also in that yours is apparently very short this may be a camping or hiking utensil so maybe keep an eye out at sporting goods stores and the like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,similar to a kitchamajig just google it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here are some links to the closest examples i could find some of these might work great if you modify them slightly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess it would be foolish to think that i was the to look for it thank you for the link it did shed at least a new angle on finding it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,close but not it ty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these are similar but not quite it ty

whatisthisthing,not_removed,the when is nearly impossible for starters the picture shows almost no detail and whats more fakes and reproductions are abundant where physical statuary are concerned value will be incredibly difficult to ascertain and youll have to shell out a good chunk of change to have them authenticated to be worth anything if they do turn out to be authentic then youll have to contend with the fact that its likely not legal to have them the indian government tends to get a little touchy about people passing around antiquities im not sure where you are but you may have them seized for return by your government if you start trying to sell authentic pieces for which you have no solid provenance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,help with what they are the figurine here depicts httpsenwikipediaorgwikiyalimythology the mythical guardian usually seen sculpted on pillars in south indian hindu temples when they were made this would require some more information like what are they made of and how big are they

whatisthisthing,not_removed,apache tears i have some too guy up above who said obsidian is correct but these are specifically called apache tears
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be obsidian aka volcanic glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look briquettes to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as a finn my guess would be that there is or used to be a sauna around somewhere and those rocks are from the stoveheater
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there wouldnt happen to be a sauna nearby would there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this not just
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it may be httpwwwfirepitglassrockscomrock from a gaspowered firepit or fireplace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the piece on top looks like salt or possibly quartz cant see enough detail to tell on the rest they somewhat look like they have been shapedrounded by power tools they have flat ground facets are they heavy smooth or rough clearer pics would help a lot as theres lots of options
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some suggested obsidian but i dont think so these dont look naturally occurring to me they look more like manmade glass rocks its the really translucent and clear one that stands out to me rocks like these are often used for landscaping and fire pits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had posted that obsidian comment and i have to agree i actually had some apache tears when i was a kid this person is correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree these look just like the rocks i sometime find in big bags of perlite obsidan in perlite
whatisthisthing,not_removed,grandparent used to put those in their basement to get rid of the dampness didnt work

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know what they are but i think they could be jade and they look a lot like the things i found when i googled flat round jade carvings maybe thatll give you a place to start
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why didnt you ask the shopkeeper what they were

whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a hip flask same general shape
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you this was really helpful would still like to know during what years these canteens were made though if possible century is too broad of a timeline
whatisthisthing,not_removed,likely solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yea it feels more like aluminum actually thats why i added what looks to be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well scoured google for the past minutes and couldnt find anything relevant that even remotely resembles factual information about your canteen however in such cases we can always rely on the unreliable friend of fact mr conjecture seeing the absolute dearth of information regarding the company we can assume theyve been out of business for quite a while most results came from ebay striking those off the list the rest were other people asking questions similar to yours on forums about the thing they found furthermore quedlinburg the city it was based in went to eastgermany after the war and that is where the easily accessible historical trail ends in my limited investigation private companies werent really a thing in eastern europe so im sure we can narrow it down to now i dont know where you live and i dont know your family history but using the magical powers of conjecture i hereby pronounce your greatgrandfather to be an american serviceman who found a canteen somewhere in germany and took it home with him as a souvenir if you really want to know more try to find an antiquarian with some knowledge of antique german metalware just google antique german metalware find antiquarians and stores with a phone number and keep calling them until they give you information point you even further in the right direction or until you get a restraining order good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its old i imagine pewter or some lead alloy is more likely aluminum was an expensive metal up until the very end of the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,alright thanks very much this timeline is much better for me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not that old i have a canteen that looks exactly like that one i got it when i was a kid in the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for suctioning mucus out of lungs here is the modern version

whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwmushroomexpertcomcoprinoidhtml inky cap the fruiting body isnt dangerous its done its thing sadly the fruiting body is an indicator of things far more harmful to you and your house what you see is just a fruiting body like an apple on a tree the rest of the mushroom is growing in your walls and is slowly decomposing wood and other organic matter the mushrooms ability to grow is a sign that there is a reoccurring source of moisture in the walls providing a good environment for the mushroom to grow and fruit the high levels of moisture open your house up to various other things that are far more dangerous like black molds and dry rot which have structural implications for your house getting the leak fixed assess the current level of damage and other things growing if nothing else is growing and put a dehumidifier in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i live in so cal and weve been having some rain lately shocking and i just noticed this fungus growing out of my ceiling that wasnt there before the rain does anyone know what type it is and if its dangerous

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lava rock with olivine deposits if this was slag it would be polished thats the whole point of slag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was quick thank you this is solved edit maybe not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikislag is a material used in smelting often containing glass or borax that will melt and become liquid but float on top of the liquid metal this prevents oxidation and the resulting creation of impurities chemicals like borax and other additives bind to impurities in the molten metal and then can be removed taking the impurities with them slag is drawn off the top of the crucible or left behind after a bottom pour it ends up in a pile of lumps usually shattering into pieces as it cools there is no way slag would be polished unless it was used after the fact in a tumbler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more pictures here httpmeteoriteswustleduidslaghtm it may be volcanic if found on a beach in an area with volcanic activity if there was steelmaking activity in the area and not volcanic then its likely slag glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry not the point of slag the point that its the beach slag is soft no would it not be polished i guess i had a bias from seeing so much of it polished shrugs vote up for knowledge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i found it in lyme regis uk and it looks like theres a lot of oil shale there but i cant find anything else online i dont think theres any volcanic activity im going to say this this is likely solved and that it is slag glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,slag is metal and glasslike elements its brittle and hard if it spent a long enough time in the surf it could get polished just like httpsenwikipediaorgwikiseaglass but it starts off very much rough like broken rock and glass typically are because its often used as earth fill or dumped as waste it ends up in all sorts of odd places a barge could have dumped a load into the ocean and this washed up in the last storm ive never seen polished slag except when it had been done deliberately to use the slag glass as decoration or building material
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah this sounds exactly rightthere was quite a bit of junk on the beach so i wouldnt be surprised if it was dumped off a barge or something and definitely seems like half glasshalf metal which is what had me so stumped i still think its quite pretty even if its essentially garbage thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for sure it used to be very popular to carve slag glass into decorations and make lamp shades and such with it theres some cool stuff on google under slag glass art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,edit from second link any project that involves the use of cranes ladders dump trucks or any extendable equipment should take proper precautions to ensure powerlines are covered and the area is safe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like they are going to tear down the building and they are warning any crane operator to watch out for the power line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is in a construction zone they are refurbishing a building so warning markings for cranes

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it takes lead pellets im trying to findout the brand

whatisthisthing,not_removed,certainly looks like an old tube amplifier something like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an amplifier probably for an old ham radio
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an amplifier from the arrangement of tubestransformers perhaps a guitar amp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just like everyone has said already its probably an old amplifier of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,connectors on the left sure look like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the largest tubemight be a western electric if its a real and in good condition could be worth several hundred dollars normally you want to buy matched pairsand those are around
whatisthisthing,not_removed,old tube amp would need to be brought up on a variac and filter capacitors would most likely need to be replaced after that i can see just by looking that the big tube is the rectifier could be a type or i can tell by the two plates so it is a full wave rectifier smaller tube is the power tube probably a the smaller transformer is the audio output transformer pretty simple really since i am am used to repairing tube radios
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks folks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i tried a ham and eggs radio once but the signal was scrambled

whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be a fox
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sounds like toads in the fall leaves rustling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it sounds like a fox
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a fox could be a possibility ive tried looking up sounds they make though and none really sound too similar to what i was hearing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are called swangas and are good for nothing besides street cred
whatisthisthing,not_removed,decoration
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are fake real knock offs were used in the early days of auto racing on wheels that used a single center wheel nut as opposed to or lug nuts back then to make changing tires faster they could knock off the wheel nut with a rubber mallet and replace it with a quick spin they have since been replace with that are put on with an in the and a young person put prong knockoffs on their car to emulate race cars later hub caps and rims with prong center that were non functional became popular since there was no need to alter the actual wheel assembly but they were usually still made to look somewhat real these wheels on this car are in no way realistic but carry on the prong tradition signifying a desire to make the car look fast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont mind me very popular style to have your car with these wheel attachments definitely popular within the lower income communities heres a video example shows a car and a bicycle with them please mute for a few seconds if not interested in music
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ooh commodore or ss anywho theyre to stop little ricer punks and grannies in camries getting too close to your pride and joy whilst parked at walmart
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a cop car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not to make it look fast they are simply for aesthetics they are nicknamed swangas and popular in houston amongst the ubranhip hop crowd
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is not a real cop car everybody can buy a caprice and make it look like a cop car edit apparently it is a real cop car that is a pretty neat pr stunt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i apologize to my apparent misunderstanding are we talking about the center part with the arms sticking off of the center or the whole wheel i was referring to the center cap which is a knockoff and please do not put words in my mouth i never said they make a car look fast i said that kids put them knockoffs not swangas on their cars because they were imitating race cars adding a chrome piece to your wheel will not make your car look fast any more than adding striping will
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rwhatsthisbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen brake fluid do that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did someone pour a stripperthinner on the car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats paint stripper you can see where it ran as it was poured hence the rounded edges youve either got vandals or youve really pissed someone off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agree that a paint removing liquid was poured on it with intent the two lines between the blobs would indicate that the bottle was poured in a purposeful motion like back and forth or hovering over the car as for the fluid several will damage paint i think this is more about the intent than the fluid did you tick anyone off recently break up badly if i had to guess the small amount leads me to think a bottle of nail polish remover itd be more common in a purse than a vandal carrying around some other solvent for kicks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,poor primer application poor surface prep prior to the color coat application oils on primer layer excessive heat from engine compartment insulation missing acidic chemical spilled on hood theres a whole slew of possibilities
whatisthisthing,not_removed,brake fluid will do this and as a bonus it permeates the metal and paint will never stick on it again so someone really pissed someone off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was caused by a chemical
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very likely nail polish remover acetone was spilt here or another chemical very similar to it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there it is source work in an industry where i see this often
whatisthisthing,not_removed,back when my brakes leaked a lot i kept a spare bottle of brake fluid in the bed of my truck in front of the fender well on the drivers side the paint is completely stripped away now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this was my guess too something like nail polish remover poured on the hood if this is a repaint job then poor prep could cause this too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mine bubbled and peeled after my engine caught on freaking fire so seconding excessive heat and a possibility although the pattern looks more like spilled fluid possibly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you just need to get the metal acid etched and it will stick again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everything is a chemical because everything is made of matter so you are right it was caused by something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,congratulations on the edgy highschoolesque comment complete with stereotypical splitting hairs to prove that someone was wrong in a pedantic way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was just pointing something out and i found humor in it i feel sad now that you didnt get it and that i didnt execute my comment reply that well to show the humor instead it just came across as irritable so for that i apologise anyway keeping this short i dont want to fight over something so meaningless if thats what you want to do with your time then so be it

whatisthisthing,not_removed,so awesome great find hasnt been mentioned yet but its actually part to a piece megazord that connects to the other animals such as my brother had this entire set
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh my god that was my favourite toy as a kid i can hardly believe youre holding the same one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so that just blew my mind thank you for alerting me to this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,missing the white eagle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep it was on the appliances shelf in the store so i plopped down of the couch marked sold and just started messing with it i decided there was no way i could leave the little guy there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i kinda want one now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,falconzord didnt come with that set it was sold on its own i have both at home somewhere from when i was a kid plus some of the other zords
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh man my friend had these and i completely forgot about them until now the falcon went on the back right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup clipped onto the back also fit onto the shogunzord as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these come with the roseart brand toy that spins a piece of paper while you drop food color or dye on the paper to make art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a disposable glue dispenser to me iswas the tip sharp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this turned out way more innocent than i expected
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a dispenser used for precision application the needle in the middle is hollow and fluid passes through it these can be used for all sorts of materials like glue paint masking fluid etc whatever youre hearing rattling in there is just dried up material from what it used to hold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,needle as in sewing needle or hypo needle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks a little like a solder paste tip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be used for henna tattoos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a super glue bottle the lids often have a tiny pin that sticks into the bottle to keep air out and poke a hole if the top gets sealed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,something like these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes not sure why someone would just throw that in my yard though seems like something you wouldnt just have outside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it also has some crystal like substance in it i can hear it rattle when i shake it might cut it open to investigate more
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be right seems like there is dried up material inside the tube part was thinking maybe super glue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i was thinking though the ops version looks like its smaller than any examples ive seen or could find in searching with a metal tip ive gotten small single use packs of locktite in with products before that were in very similar containers but with a plastic tip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly moved by an animal those crystals might be sweet smelling or tasting animals will grab and run with stuff a lot birds grab stuff from the ground on the wing all the time then go perch to check it out if its not food or nesting materials they drop it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it hot where you are do the neighbours have kids could it be a last resort water pistol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a misfit shine my fiancee has one and its popped out of the wristband a few times
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it might be a bluetooth beacon of some sort anything on the other side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,misfit theyre terrible as staying that band i hated mine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it is the logo for a coffee brand in asia perhaps for a coffee device or appliance or the cap of a coffee pod or something edit definitely chinese
whatisthisthing,not_removed,misfit huh well they definitely got the branding right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like someone else found one too see if this isnt the same thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it does seem to be a misfit tracker thank you and i dont have a picture of the other side my dad asked me to find out thank you ill mark it as solved as soon as i can go on my laptop the app doesnt have that function yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep thats another misfit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for cutting the seatbelt according to this guy which i found by googling sharp blade in lighter socket adapter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and the pointy end is for breaking a window
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks that makes sense
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there a hotbox detector location nearby what is the railroad milepost can you post photos of the equipment bolted to the outer sides of the rails at this location
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it facing in a direction to be read by the engineer on the train or is it something for auto traffic where the road crosses the track my guess is it indicates wayside horns at the crossing signals so the engineer shouldnt blow his own horn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a throughhole momentary switch probably costs less than each making it hard to buy just one look at this ebay link where you can get of them for with free shipping
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a surface mount tactile switch do you know if it is momentary or does it stay active as long as it is depressed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i think this will give me enough to go off of to buy a replacement solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank youits for a play button you press it and the unit plays the audio file however it also works in conjunction with a record button when you want to record you press both the record and play button together httpimgurcomapvruy solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,momentary switches stay on as long as they are depressed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its hard to tell from your photo but yours look like pin switches check dimensions before ordering
whatisthisthing,not_removed,btw i was incorrect it is not surface mount it is through hole momentary as uandrogenoide said i was just looking at the thumbnail and had just had to replace some surface mount switches btw you might be able to pick one up at radio shack you pay a little more each for them but they come to a pack as opposed to lots of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks much more like minethere are only two solder points on the board underneath each switch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really appreciate it thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he is right those are standard tactile through hole switches they are pretty common you get them in bulk from china for pennies otherwise you get them for bucks on ebay if you do not want to wait too long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can also try all electronics they do web orders and small parts counts and cheap prices
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shit thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,allows you to punchmark an impression on a spot to be drilled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,roll pin drivers they arent transfer punches if that was the case they would have all different sizes with the same size dot on every one this is also why some are hollow you insert the roll pin into the driver they are actually from a different set
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im soooo stupid here is how to use a transfer punch the regular way and a unique way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome i thought it might be some sort of punch but i still dont understand the advantages over a regular punch i dont get why it matters what size the drill bit is in relation to the punch obviously a regular punch is good for almost any size drill bit thanks for your help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was my first thought as well but i dont think that is it what is the purpose of the point and why make the shaft so long and the same diameter also and would be much cheaper to make sorry if this sounds rude i appreciate your help thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my set looks almost identical to and the points on these are only like different sizes you cannot have the same size tip on a o punch as you would on a i appreciate your help but if you search for transfer punch on google images they look absolutely identical now search for roll pin drivers on google images they look totally different thanks for your help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you match the size of the punch to the size of the hole your fastener goes through to make sure youre in the center a regular punch is fine for a single hole but if youre transferring a pattern of holes its important that theyre all centered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,right so its ideal for something like drilling through a piece of square tube i measure mark center punch drill then use these to make sure that the second hole will be perfectly inline by centering the punch based on the first punch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you know about center punches though right yea these will be really nice for drilling through square tube so i can put the holes inline mine are never dead on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exactly but more commonly these are used to transfer the layout of a group of holes ie if i want to bolt one plate on to another i might drill the first plate clamp it to the second and then use the appropriate xfer punch to mark the second plate to match the first the catch is this the xfer punches should only be used to make a small mark that mark is enough to line up a proper center punch which you can give a good whack to make a dimple that the drill will pick up on if you try to use the xfer punch to make a center punch mark you will dull them quickly and unlike center punches xfer punches cannot be resharpened btw yr machinist here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting so definitely dont use these like a center punch got it thanks for your help

whatisthisthing,not_removed,think its a bad translation since the site is indonesian
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from my digging this pattern of spotting is common on illegal and counterfeit furs this spotting fishscale pattern is used to make fox and dog furs look like a wild cat or leopard however upon further inspection youll notice that there arent any mammals that actually have this pattern cats have rosettes stripes and belly markings by looking at the face and ears of your fur id guess its some sort of dog or fox and the pattern has been dyed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,head body size and main colors look like a wolf or husky oh god to me i think the spots are fake too and maybe a different tail added
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeeeaaah i wouldnt count on this being real the whitebit of the pattern seems to more closely resemble a thick knotted rope net pattern than actual natural fur patterns my current guess would be a dog or a coyote skin spraypainted with a net over it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how big is it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe a civet of some kind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these is a similar pattern pelt in a pic on this site
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here are some more pics httpswwwflickrcomcameraroll
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its too regular in ops image to be this species malabar civets also have rosette spots near the spine and lines the legnth of the body its also the wrong tail its likely a dog skin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,about to feet without the tail
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont think so i cant find a civet with the same pattern
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could you post them on imgur i dont want to have to make a yahoo account
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks nothing like a coyote
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what type of coyote do you think it is i was told it was bought in china
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh dang thats much bigger than the animal i had a guess for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is quite possible that it is an ornately died dog pelt i have seen similar ones sold in china as scooter seat covers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah someone suggested that could be id like to find a pic of one to know for sure if its dyed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some kind of logicnumber conversion bcdx could be binary coded decimal could be converting to or similar to which could be the answer

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a relay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks makes sense now the coil would induce a magmatic field thus attracting the magnet on top which when pulled towards the coil creates a contact between the brass looking things at the back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is used to control higher voltages using a lower voltage these could be from a cars blinker if you have an older car this is in fact the part that makes the ticking noise of the blinker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like trench art of some kind ww i by my guess looks like caliber bullets soldered to the plate and the big round part looks like the back end of an artillery round the winged bolt looks like it is where the primer went
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess is a homemade kerosene lamp hammer the spikey bit into the bottom of a wooden beam fill the pounder with kerosene dip a wick in and light just spitballing a potential practical use for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,almost looks like a snowshoe for a high heeled shoe pretty sure its trench art though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kind of looks like something youd maybe melt metals with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,certainly a trench art piece possibly an ink well store the pens between the bullets screw cap keeps the ink from drying out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it looks like a snail
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shell casing marked so probably manufactured july and has the kings arrow so its british manufactured could have been fired by canadians though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the wing bolt is the primer with wings soldered onto it the solder spots indicate that something is missing from the middle of it like says it could be an inkwell with the missing part being for storing the cap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most plausible description ive seen the first image from trench art lantern i think we have a winner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont think the bullets would be sharp enough or would withstand the abuse of being hammered into wood however if there is a gap in a wall say a trench wall then you tilt it toward the wall insert the tongue then let it hang down it would be held in place by gravity
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no telling if thats the original shape or got bent over time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,still think it looks like a snail
whatisthisthing,not_removed,man these are tickling my brain looking at these i feel like ive held them in my hands so much that i can feel the cutouts im super curious to know

whatisthisthing,not_removed,my father was born in greece we always had a bunch these things around the house

whatisthisthing,not_removed,my grandfathers museum in rural manitoba is being shut down and it contents being distributed to other museums and collections and during the process weve come across a few items that were uncatalogued and had us scratching our heads items in the museum are generally from the mid to early this one was found in a kitchen drawer although that is no guarantee its actually kitchenrelated it is fairly heavy and feels like a ceramic to the touch the item has clearly been worn down and discoloured with the germany marking mostly worn away there are no other identifying marks that i could spot though there is a series of parallel lines on the back side i wondered if it could be some kind of antique knife hone but ive come up totally empty in my attempts to identify it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im going with clay good luck with this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for sharpening large knife
whatisthisthing,not_removed,has a picture of a scythe hone about halfway down and id say youre absolutely correct well done im glad my guess wasnt too far off

whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol it is a tie hanger but badly designed i had something similar at my home in beijing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be missing a tray that sits in it to create dividers for ties and watches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,too low to the ground for shirts rods too slippery for ties
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pants rack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i feel like this has come down to pants rack vs tie rack given the small size im going with tie rack also i need to learn to fold things thanks all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for airdrying clothing would be my guess most likely to lay a sweater on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tie rack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it too low to hang a pair of pants on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how is it too slippery for ties if you hang half over each side or half in terms of the weight they shouldnt slide at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,noi am not a smart man thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually same problem pants keep slipping off but maybe im not hanging them correctly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpiimgurcomcrhlnjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just fold them in half now that i think about it seems odd it would only hold pairs of pantskind of a waste of space must be something other than pants
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they seem far apart enough and low enough that several pants could be hung on each bar

whatisthisthing,not_removed,how do you mark solved from reddit is fun
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed mine did that once and i pulled it down to find exposed wires touching i wrapped them up in electrical tape and that fixed it up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh my god youre right i pushed the doorbell and it shocked me the noise has stoppedfor now thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its not its supposed to be there and humming is normal and leave me alone edit disregard that its a doorbell and the transformer inside is whats buzzing its old and you should go buy a new one i just read that joke comments get you banned here and theres only so many subreddits that this username applies to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can just reply solved in a comment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay serious mode im a commercial electrician if your doorbell shocks you when you push it thats a little funny but a lot bad its somewhere between current kills not volts blah blah blah and there really isnt much risk of an electrical shockinduced stoppage of heart here but there definitely is a fire risk most house fires start because of electrical problems and this could easily be one of those cases if you dont get the power cut asap buy a new one they are cheap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the button at the door is sticking or there is a wiring fault either way you should have it looked at as these are not meant to be energized for long periods of time and may overheat and cause a fire you can pull the plastic cover off and disconnect the wires if it continues to buzz in the future but i recommend you do get the problem fixed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,waitshocked you as in oh my that was a surprise or shocked you as in ow that fucking hurt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah
whatisthisthing,not_removed,got fire insurance mine did that and the cover melted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fire insurance you mean the super soaker hah am i correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,please dont put water on an electrical fire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah there is something so blissful about being naive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah there is something so blissful about being naive whats more blissful is no one can tell if im being sarcastic if im totally stupid or whats gonna happen because its the internet and i could die tomorrow my house could burn down because i never changed the transformer and no one on reddit would know unless of course someone creates a local news article and then links this exact comment to it but i mean what are the odds right guys am i right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its king crab leg meat the actual product name たらばかに一番脚肉ほぐし身 was simply run through a translator a la google translate and left as is literal translation japanese amazon edition

whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok thanks ive mounted the ssd in a convertor caddy but i just wondered what that was for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably mainly for fitting into laptops iirc to make sure the fit is snug and it doesnt move about inside stressing the sata plug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you are referring to the wooden item in the middle its a seed planter ive heard them called corn jobbers but i think there are other names also
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why does it have a furniture finish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it may have been refinished or polished by a seller or it may have barely been used over the years the ones i used when i was younger were very old and less shiny i think is right though about them being finished just to protect the wood from the elements
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a it needs to stand up to the elements so it needs a finish to protect it b many years ago manufacturers of goods took pride in their work so even massproduced objects were made to be durable and aesthetically pleasing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mean even this has a similar finish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they must like them fancy

whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes its an ethernet switch op appears to be asking what the internal components are doing i guess just out of curiosity first pics are the enclosure pic the square ic in the middle is a realtek ethernet controller ic its the microprocessor that does most of the actual work in the box in the old days theres be a zillion components in this thing but now this square ic does everything everything else is support staff the silver thing in the upper left hand corner is the crystal oscillator frequency reference for the microcontroller the other small components are various capacitors and resistors pic is the voltage regulator ic with two electrolytic capacitors on the right youll note its right next to the power connector this thing is powered by a wall wart which probably puts out about volts dc the voltage regulator ic steps this down probably to volts and regulates the voltage the two electrolytic capacitors reduce ripple and noise to smooth out the voltage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is for sharing your internet connection with many computers by a wired network
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a switch google the chipset to get more details on the ic pretty much all switching is done in hw nowadays it basically takes packets from one port and puts them into one other as opposed to a hub which would replicate packets on all ports
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dlink will tell you all about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what do you want to know i see a few resistors a couple ics leds and the the back terminates the pins for the ports to the board
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not true one pair for rx one pair for tx gigabit requires all pairs

whatisthisthing,not_removed,ice distance golf balls have different compression characteristics than standard golf balls and can travel further with less initial impact energy they are usually marketed to women who want a little extra distance on the golf course with each stroke edit a word
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe that ice has something to do with the look of the ball clear cover and distance has to do with flight characteristics its a coincidence that it was found in the lake
whatisthisthing,not_removed,obviously youre not a bowler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,plus they often have a translucent cover
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a coincidence that it was found in the lake it is pretty likely that given that you found a golf ball of any form you found it in a lake
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guessing you didnt actually try to google iti couldnt find anything so i posted it to this subwhich is what the sub is forwhats your problem buddy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i read your comment and googled ice distance the results were not as helpful as you might suppose this post is amongst the most relevant responses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i meant the word ice and the ice on the lake all golf balls wind up the water or the woods given enough time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perhaps you should have googled acuity ice distance first result is an ebay auction for a pack of golf balls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think thats some kind of security tag for merchandise the colours are probably ink to stain the thief looks like they melted off the clip

whatisthisthing,not_removed,security tag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,

whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thanks id say this is solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so we shouldnt use it in a model were making one of the kids found it and brought it in

whatisthisthing,not_removed,any connectionsports on any of the sides
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you figure it out op
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe a house arrest bracelet without the bracelet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,put in fresh batteries and see if the red dot lights up if it doesnt look at it through your phones camera it can see infrared
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very unsure but it might be a device to retransmit irsignals for remotes so the remote can be used further away from the device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking it looks like a sensor for a remote
whatisthisthing,not_removed,smoke or detector
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the only holes are the tiny ones in the front are they enough for a sound emitting device ill ask her about that and report back thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no it doesnt havent heard back from her on the fresh batteries she send me the photos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no nothing put in batteries and your good to go
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeahlast resort kind of thing im not there so i can only relay what shes sending me will try the next time im there though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wouldnt they require some kind of labeling very unlikely though no run ins with the cops afaik
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill report back on that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah good point those slots appear to be for a sound high pitched also it appears to be designed to attach to a wall via screws edit added the screws sentence
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thats what we thought too another thing we thought it might be a remote outdoor sensor for a radio weather station but she says she never had one of those stations in her house and why would it be behind the stereo then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aa batteries dont pump out a lot of power and tend to have limited hours meaning to me it has intermittent purpose and use but its puzzling hope it gets solved edit mobile spells
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an outdoor sensor doesnt require that much power so i think maybe two aas should do the job the ultrasound repellent thingy sounds promising too but i dont know how much power they draw theyd definetly need to be plugged in for prolonged use at least google says so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a direct vent fireplace the duct has a duct inside it external air goes down the outside hot gas goes up the inside duct inside fireplace is completely sealed httpsenwikipediaorgwikidirectventfireplace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the tabs visible on the bottom legs and curved top in photo leads me to believe you are right a screen may be missing ive never seen this particular vent but you should be able to get some hardware cloth and create a bug screen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre correct but its still letting bugs in at least into the fireplace cavity last year i had dozens of moths in there blech and the wind has blown the pilot out before so i feel like theres a capcoverscreen missing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gas fireplace im trying to find out if i need a covervent because it is just a big hole open into the house
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i solved it with a little digging behind the fireplace with a flashlight and a mirror i found a model number its a regency model and i found that the vent is in fact missing a cover and even found the part number and price online thanks for the input
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah each one of those yellow tictac sized chips is an led
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a surface mount ceiling light fixture missing the glass dome which would be held in place by the knurled nut in the center
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the yellow and dark chips are the lights and electronics the white part is a board usually silkscreened with circuitry connections on it yes that is the light bulb

whatisthisthing,not_removed,leather belts made from linkedtogether smaller pieces were popular in the and leathercrafting itself was not uncommon as a hobby these look like theyre meant to be made into something bigger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when i was a kid very long time ago these were sold in craft kits to make a belt the type used to hold pants up there were enough links to make a belt for a large person a small person would have links left over too nice to throw away useless for anything else
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what era army patches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could they be links from a leather drive belt something like they used on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is probably wrong but it could be something you put on bootlaces to keep them from becoming untied i have never heard of something like that but the holed look about shoelace size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree its a drive belt section like others have mentioned like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm interesting idea the fact they were in the box with us army patches etc may or may not be relevant could be they just ended up in there at some point and are unrelated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved both your answer and the example given by uspapoop below clinched it for me im guessing it wasnt per se army related but just something my great uncle just happened to have had and it got in the box somehow thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kit that contains very similar looking components

whatisthisthing,not_removed,jar opener
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that sounds promising per the original thread its metal and heavy inches across inner circle inches about inches deep
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im skeptical if its supposed to sit on carpet why would there be the tiny felt pads on the underside theyre there to prevent scratching the surface its sitting on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is mold you should clean every now and then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as others have said this is mold and is normally fairly easy to clean off with the right products but there is also the other side why there is mold in the first place your bathroom needs more airventilation and possibly a bit more heat heat may sound counterintuitive since mold likes heat but hot air can hold more water so the walls dry up faster if your bathroom have poor ventilation you should keep the door open for some time after showering this will make the moisture disperse into your houseapartment instead of getting trapped in the bathroom unless you have problems with high humidity in the rest of your unit that is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tilestone guy here that looks like real marble be careful with what you use to clean that mold marble is soft and can scratch with abrasive cleaners it needs to be periodically sealed especially in a shower after you get it clean seal it with impregnator not a water based sealer caulking needs to be periodically replaced grout will also clean up easier if you seal it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,genuinely curious how youve gone youre entire life without seeing bathroom moldmildew
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i recommend dettol mould and mildew remover not sure if its available where you are but im sure theres similar products that do the same job just spray it on ventilate the room as best you can its pretty pongy come back in an hour or so and marvel at the difference if theres any left just repeat no need to scrub just give it a rinsewipe when youre done
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bleach actually doesnt work as well as your led to believe it will come back and wont completely kill it try getting this product called molderizer it totally works and is organic and nontoxic weve used in it a few places and it worked great
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lmfao
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a species of mold as i said further down it is almost definitely cladosporium it could be alternaria or stachybotrys but i doubt anything else although its possible also of the time mold is not a health issue if you have a ton of it in your house you will develop allergies long before anything else to all of the people in the comments who say use bleach on everything the reason you end up having to rebleach all the time for things like this is because it only kills the mold for hours and after that its worthless if you spray bleach on anything porous it will kill whats there in most cases for hours once the chlorine has evaporated it no longer works and no you have just moisture do not clean mold off walls with bleach it will make your problem soooooo much worse source environmental microbiologist dealing with mold all day errrryday
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just clean your shit every once a month
whatisthisthing,not_removed,should maybe look into cleaning occasionally
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah its chocolate perfectly safe to dip strawberries or something in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my text explaining this seems to have not been submitted ill rewrite it i discovered this black substance in my bathroom recently link for pics in title its behind the caulking in the corners of my shower and behind my sink what is it is it mold a stain is it safe to use this washroom or should i get it removed am i safe to remove it myself also when the weather changed my bathroom smelled bad for a week or so now its back to normal do you think the black stuff and the smell are related i tend to over think things so any helpsuggestions are appreciated thanks in advance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is neither mold nor black mold although tons and tons of people think this is what mold looks like this is mildew bleach scrub move on with your life and some folks are right actual mold needs a mold fighting cleaner not bleach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its mold you can give it a good soaking with bleach and that will likely get rid of a lot of it but not all because of the caulking to do it right scrape off the caulk then spray with bleach and scrub it away protip when recaulking fill the tub with water first
whatisthisthing,not_removed,baking soda and vinegar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bleach water works but so does clorox cleanup with bleach my shower is tile and will get like that if i dont spray it often the problem is moisture and probably not much venting for the moisture i keep a bottle of the spray close by and use it every couple of days after showering i just spray it on and leave it when i shower the next day its already clean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this may get lost in the sea of comments but there are lots of things that can accumulate in the bathroom bacteria molds algae slimes etc can cause the black marks that you see i read somewhere that water rich in manganese can do that as well most likely its not harmful and just needs to be cleaned let to dry and possibly sealed the red stains are likely from bacteria httpsenwikipediaorgwikiserratiamarcescens
whatisthisthing,not_removed,easy black mold edit why am i being downvoted it seriously is black mold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,combine part bleach and part baking soda so that it has the consistency of wet sand wear gloves or whatever now put a small sum of it in the palm of your hand smack your hand flat against the wall and work the concoction into the grout those white lines now let it sit for a short while now the easiest way to do the next step is while you are in the shower sort of taking a shower use a rag to rinse it all off tada youve just fixed your yucky problem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mix equal part of white vinegar dish washing liquid ex dawn a little water put in spray bottle spray everything wait min and clean with water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay bleach and a toothbrush scrub the grout as thoroughly as you can just squirt thick bleach on then use a mug of water to dunk old toothbrush in rinse thoroughly that looks like actual marble if its not marble but ceramic tile then after a proper rinse if any of the pink stain remains repeat using vinegar be careful bleach acid is dangerous that rinsing must be properly done if it is marble then once dry use car wax to buff up the tiles nicely
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i keep a spray bottle of bleach and water to use only for my shower walls and tub spray and let it sit for an hour or so then then rinse and spray again with the works shower tub cleaner from the dollar store the best soap scum remover in all the land and only just make sure you rinse well between the two products
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im grateful for this post thanks reddit brb have mold to napalm with vinegar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the black stuff is moldmildew the orange stuff is probably calcium build up the orange will probably scrub off more easily than the black stuff buy a surface cleaner with bleach if that doesnt do the trick find a cleaner that brags about using enzymes this looks like perfectly normal bathroom mold we cant say for sure if its unsafe based on this picture but it looks perfectly safe normal from here just dont try to eat or anything like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,should point out that it might be time to consider installing an exhaust fan dry rooms dont normally get mouldy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you can find it i recommend getting home armor mold and mildew i spray that on my grout and it looks like i just recaulked all my tile after minutes saved me a lot of time scrubbing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you want to make the groutcaulking white again take bleach and paper towels soak the paper towels and place on the grout for a few hours and itll be white again mold should be removed first though ideally
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whoever did this work used wrong type of silicone shouldve used sanitary silicone cuz it doesnt mold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,black mold is what youre seeing there happens a lot in damp andor dark places inside homes like the attic basement or bathrooms some simple bleach and water mixture will cleankill it just be careful to use protective equipment when using dangerous chemicals like bleach do your best to keep it off your skin out of your eyes and mouth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what does it taste like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,black mold is no joke continued exposure has been linked to respitory issues httpsenmwikipediaorgwikistachybotrys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks am i safe to clean it myself does it look excessive so i remove the caulking and scrub it away then replace the caulking sorry for all the questions im just pretty unfamiliar with this stuff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool this is an aspect of it i hadnt considered i live in canada and its become cold recently my washroom gets pretty cold ill try to keep it warmer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the fan on his vent may need cleaned i did that last week and now i dont get condensation on my mirrors when i bathe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i hadnt really considered that i could damage the marble how often should i replace the caulking once a year
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably has to do with the fact this guy has never ever cleaned his house could you imagine what the rest of the place looks like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,idk im starting to think i just never noticed it beforewhen i was growing up my parents house was kinda dirty but i never really thought about it or looked that closely also im only in my early
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that sounds amazing and much easier then what i was planning to do seriously thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the information and for saving me from future cleaning ill use that instead of bleach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been living in the same place for years and i have been cleaning my bathroom shower stall with bleach water the whole time it has not gotten worse but stayed the same if not a bit better than when i moved in so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its behind the caulking tho strawberries cant access it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,beside all of the good advice about cleaning it another thing to think about is there was water behind your caulking unless it was tiled on a brick wall you should be checking for water damagerot in the wall otherwise the problem could spread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it definitely sounds like youve got ventilation issues in your bathroom that would be the reason for the funky smell and the mold i would think the mold will return again and again if you dont get the ventilation fixed doesnt matter what you use to clean it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why im getting ready to recaulk my tub and im wondering why in the hell would i fill my tub first
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm that doesnt sound good do you know roughly how much it should cost to get someone to look atfix this im not too familiar with this stuff and wouldnt want to get ripped off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive tried so many cleaners and havent gotten satisfactory results for this problem i havent tried this one youve been happy with this cleaner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the mold formsgrows on a film of soapscum and semiorganic goo after a while not directly to the silicone op just need to clean their shower
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats very unlikely to be stachybotrys as a marble shower is not at all its ideal growing environment more than likely its cladosporium or alternaria which commonly grow in showers neither are known to be particularly toxic unless you are allergic but with the constant humidity theyre not going to be throwing as many spores into the air as they would in a drier environment also for the record stachybotrys gets a much worse rap than it deserves thanks to scary documentaries and articles yes it is toxic but not nearly as toxic as people make it out to be secondly most black molds are not stachybotrys so whenever someone posts a photo of black mold its probably better to not scare them when there are plenty of more qualified folk on reddit to properly help them out source microbiologist who specialized in fungi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwwikihowcomremovebathroommold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bathroom mold like that is not going to hurt you in a highhumidity environment like bathroom showers youre always going to get mold over time regular cleaning will keep it down but eventually mold will permeate your caulking around the tub or tiles and youll need to remove and recaulk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just mold its not going to hurt you just clean it there were some reports a few years ago about toxic black molds in homes causing respiratory problems but case reports were very rare and the evidence is limited since then people have become terrified of any and all mold they find in their home
whatisthisthing,not_removed,get tilex mold and mildew tub spray apply as directed this is not a big deal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,had a similar problem make a paste of bleach and baking soda gently apply with a toothbrush let stand for fifteen minutes rinse off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a spray bottle of bleach about once a month i just generously spray moldy areas leave it for minutes and then come back to rinse it off the mold generally comes off in pieces and washes down the drain and i keep rinsing until it runs clean the walls dont get mold free but im in a rented apartment in a humid environment so cleaner than really moldy is fine for me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just spray it with bleach every week or so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,vinegar kills mold bleach kills mold much better uv also kills mold redoing all the caulking isnt a huge job but its too much work just for a bit of mold i think just clean that shit with vinegar or bleach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can also fill a spray bottle with a chlorine solution and every other day or randomly between cleanings just spray down those surfaces so that the mildewmold cannot get a start
whatisthisthing,not_removed,canada use httpswwwtilexcommoldandmildewremover available at canadian tire for under safe to use on marble spray wait minutes until you see the black is gone then rinse with water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have lived in some very chilly damp parts of canada do not try to save money by keeping the heat lowoff in your bathroom you will get mold if you are a student and are leaving your property for christmas break do not turn off the heat in your apartment you can end up with mold or burst pipes if youre spending a fortune on heating make sure your windows are properly sealed and insulated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,never considered that was it full of grime or just the regular brownblack stuff at the tip of the blades
whatisthisthing,not_removed,caulking is more of a if it is broken replacement but you need to seal that stone every months most likely if the stone is sealed the mold will be less of a problem also if you arent sealing that stone it could be the source of the water that is causing the mold to grow under the caulk natural stone will absorb water and allow it to get under the caulk seal the stone and you stop that water source
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont caulk it gently scrape out the worst of it clean it good with marble cleaner seal it properly with natural stone sealer spray concrobium mold inhibitor from the depot let it dry then use a sanded grout caulk found in the tile aisle let that cure for a day or and youre done
whatisthisthing,not_removed,caulking should be replaced on average every years when it degrades
whatisthisthing,not_removed,honestly if this is real marble and youve got the id say hire a professional make sure you get a good one that will explain the process watch him and learn you may not need him next time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty much whenever it starts to look horrible they make removal tools that are plastic and wont hurt the tile or grout
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol chill thats not true at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bathroom mold also comes in a pink variety this is actually a pink bacteria not a mold at all dont be alarmed if you see it its easy enough to manage and not a danger unless its really out of hand drain flys and fruit flys also exist and can be eliminatedmanaged pretty common college apartment problems
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you cant find that look for kaboom mold mildew cleaner purple bottle it works wonders in just a few minutes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,once you get the mold under control as everyone suggests you should make a spray bottle with a mild water and bleach solution and spritz your shower daily between weekly scrubbingcleanings this will keep the mold from reappearing you should also invest in a small dehumidifier for your bathroom keeping the humidity down will also help with the mold problem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not cleaning is what got you there you always have to clean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your welcome we wasted a lot of time stink using bleach until we did some research and got advice from a professional after its gone you can use bleach to clean it on a regular basis after we gutted our bathroom due to mold we had our bathroom walls redone in this cool american clay product and it absorbs all the moisture now no steam in a tiny windowless bathroom its pretty amazing good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,itll wet the drywall and itll allow the mold to grow down into the interior of the wall if it hasnt already basically your improving the environment for the growth of the mold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol wtf did ya think it was
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uhoh thanks for the warning i never even considered that ill look into that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep it would be a good idea to pull all the caulk off let it dry out and redo it with a mildew resistant bathroom caulk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm alright thanks ill look into addressing that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the weight of the water in the tub will pull the top of the tub down a little if you caulk with the tub empty then when it dries and you fill the tub it can cause it to separate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe to catch and extra crap and its easier to clean then if it gets stuck id like to know as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if hes right and moisture is coming from behind the tile you might be in for a large bill if moisture is getting there from behind the tile that means youve got a leak behind the wall and all of the affected tile will need to be removed and the wallflooring materials behind it replaced tonfix the source of the leak at the low end of that spectrum youre probably looking at for an unlicensed contractor if you know anyone that could do it at the high end youre looking at for a professional you call out of the phone book to basically rebuild the shower that being said theres a good chance it isnt coming from behind the tile and just removing the caulking and spraying with bleach and scrubbing the shit out of it will solve it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we had a similar problem with our rental house and where we thought we had cleaned it up we had not the end result was that it spread and instead of having it addressed where it began we ended up having to rip walls apart and having our attic cleaned as well nearly later i can confidently say make sure you get it fully accessed professionally
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very much so ive tried so many homemade and not with soso results i used this the first time and thats all the convincing i needed i would say make sure you have circulation when using though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,black mold is the worst term on planet earth its black so lets lump like species of mold together to scare people in the bathroom on the tile like that it is more than likely cladosporium or stachybotrys it could also be a few other species mold does not produce mycotoxins your home in of cases it will also only produce those to kill other mold species and organisms to keep its food source source im an environmental microbiologist who analyzes mold samples all damn day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah all molds are different and black mold maybe isnt super deadly like its made out to be but it is still bad nonetheless and should be cleared up and prevented from growing back as with all other molds most black molds do increase chances of respiratory illnesss though some more than other like you say and it should be tested to know for certain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to piggyback on comment mycotoxins usually need to be ingested in sufficient quantities to cause symptoms you usually see mycotoxin toxicity as a result of contaminated grain or peanuts and even then it is exceedingly rare in this day and age the environmental hazard stems from fungal spores causing allergic reations in humans and animals and in very rare cases when the fungi attempt to colonize the respiratory tract
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just erring on the side of caution worst case im wrongconversely
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that link says in some cases professionals should be called to be on the safe side from my pictures does my mold problem look excessive enough to warrant calling in a professional or should i be fine handling it myself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,spraying vinegar on grout is a bad idea the acid will soften and erode any cement based material in a fairly short amount of time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hell yes tilex is fantastic half the time dont even need to scrub
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the exact stuff that i used to get rid of staining on my grout if you enjoy the smell of bleach good news seriously spray it and get out of the bathroom until youre ready to wipe it down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,will they take tire dollars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why when you can mix up your own bleach water solution for pennies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was just grime and lint kind of like youd see on a box fan i was afraid of mold but none was there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that sounds amazing i have a tiny bathroom with no ventilation and i have to keep the window cracked open in the winter to keep the humidity down or mildew starts growing like crazy getting out of the shower in the winter to an ice cold bathroom is no fun the house is over years old with horsehair plaster walls and my bathroom used to be a porch so theres a lack of insulation on top of that ugh well its not like im putting up new walls in my rental but i will look into this stuff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,who has drywall shower walls my shower stall walls are plastic most people have tile or fiberglass not drywall
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chocolate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have an exhaust fan in the bathroom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that makes sense thank you i never would have thought of that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe the weight of the water in the tub can damage the caulk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you i just ordered some
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for this comment not knowing much about mold i was worried it might be the black mold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the thing you develop allergies to mold spores what screws you is the fact that once you develop an allergy to mold being outside on a cold day with wind can make that present itself there is mold literally eeeeeverywhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should be fine doing it yourself excessive is when its covering the walls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should be fine cleaning by yourself unless youre allergic in which case youll want to wear a mask
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you are a nervous nelly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,spray it with bleach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should be good it doesnt look like theres too much try cleaning it with clorox
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive had to clean mold a few times and found a way that is simple and effective safety first wear rubber gloves and keep the area well ventilated take time to get fresh air frequently get a box of salon coil cotton in a bucket mix ratio bleach and water that is about a half cup of bleach to a gallon of water take a long strip of cotton and soak it in the bleach solution then apply the cotton strips to the areas where the mold is repeat until you have all the areas with mold covered let it set for hours remove all the cotton strips and rinse the area with water i hope this helps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that definitely looks manageable on your own
whatisthisthing,not_removed,often mold like that once it gets into the calking the only way you can get rid of it is to redo the calking a lot of newer types of calking are supposedly impregnated with stuff that retards mold but dont count on it especially if you live in a humid place like florida like i do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just get tilex mold and mildew removersays with bleach open window spray that shit over anything black or discolored walk out close the door come back in five minutes turn on hot water for your hopefully removable shower head rinse repeat with whatever is left but it wont be much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im a complete noob but that looks like black mold and i would advise having someone else clean it better safe than sorry you know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you cant get rid of it peel out that caulk cleanbleach the area and recaulk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,use scrubbing bubbles foaming bathroom cleaner spray it on and the mold will disappear then wash it off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just spray it and use gloves get a face mask if youre concerned
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should be fine use gloves and mask if youd like to feel safe if its been there a while and you havent felt anything different you should be fine lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gets rid of pink stuff on grout and brown mold on shower curtains i dont wipe it down just spray wait and rinse with running water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i sealed the grout in my shower with grout renew colorant its a bit tedious to apply but it does a great job of preventing the mold from growing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not expensive and takes all the guesswork out op doesnt sound like hes extremely handy comes in an ideal spray bottle too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its totally affordable and it something you could actually apply yourself we got a lesson from the guy and it is a totally user friendly product if you got a hole or a ding in the wall you can easily repair it with some more clay unlike repairing drywall and plaster our house is years old too so i know what youre talking about nothing is level or plum or insulated or wired properly every time we open a wall it reveals another can of worms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry meant to specify drywall i have drywall about my shower where the plastic stops though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know you knew man ur trolling us
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool thanks for being patient and providing answers as silly as it sounds i was getting kind of worried cheers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,excessive is when its covering the walls yes for normal healthy allergy free adults mold needs to be covering over contiguous square feet for it to really be considered a serious issue for remediation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion ill get a mask to be on the safe side do you think i should wear goggles or is that overkill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,black mold is a myth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have someone else clean it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that shit sucks it doesnt clean anything the works is a magical formula that cleans like nothing else on earth and is only try it dollar tree has it along with las awesome cleaner and this stuff is the bomb pretty much the only two cleaners i use besides bleach water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ditto it just feels like a chemical attack in the mean time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol yes exactly thanks for the tip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just scrape it off with your thumb its way easier than installing an exhaust fan
whatisthisthing,not_removed,use lots of bleach it kills everything just dont mix it with amonia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont be worried you did the right thing by asking its really nothing to be concerned about its perfectly normal and occurs in most bathrooms if you are worried you could use a mask while you clean but white vinegar or bleach should clear it right up removing and replacing the sealant is a pretty easy job although time consuming youll be fine 😊
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wear a facemask while ya do it those spores can be toxic also to repeat what someone said below in a response to notyou do not use bleach it does httpblacktoxicmoldscombleachkillmoldphp use vinegar or borax solution i personally would probably do the cleaning with bleach actually removing the visible material then go over it after with the suggested solution from that link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i use tilex works great for mold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,welcome to the life of living on your own at least thats the situation im hoping for that you dont know you can clean up your own mold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,make a beach and water mixture spray let sit scrub you need a remediator if you need to remove something that has a chance of making the spores airborne thats not necessarily black mold stachybotrys but those spores are heavier and more difficult to find in the air as they settle out in a few hours source industrial hygienist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can get anti mould latex sealant that you can use once youve cleaned the existing mould off helps keep moisture out of the grout if that area gets wet a lot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just get yourself some bleach and a scrubby pad its fine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you have trouble breathing prolonged flu like symptoms fatigue asthma you should get a professional to check whether you have mold in the structure of your house in finland it is a really common problem due to building codecutting costspoor planningpoor maintenance many schools have been rebuilt because of this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,like others have said bleach will work once its all cleaned use a mix of bleachwater once in a while just fill a spray bottle and spray down the areas where the mold is now it will help keep it from coming back i use tilex cleaner to clean mine it will kill mold as well as clean soap scum off the walls one important note no matter what you use to clean this will make sure you have rubber gloves on these cleaners can be harsh on your skin after prolonged exposure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if youre worried you can wear gloves i do this when cleaning anyway and some respiratory protection
whatisthisthing,not_removed,overkill bleach kills mold on contact so does ammonia but do not mix the two
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think goggles would be overkill and if you arent having asthma attacks from it you wont need a mask i have an allergy to mold but i dont wear a mask when i find some its very common in bathrooms without proper ventilation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you dont need a mask you do need eye protection accidentally splashing bleach into your eye sucks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,removed by user
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eh im very protective about my eyes ive worn goggles when doing a really heavy cleaning especially if anything is above shoulder height as mist or drips could fall on you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ever use la awesome for cat litter boxes or a bad idea usually i just use soap and water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,worked for me straight bleach wouldnt work for me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this literally kills everything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no do not use bleach it does httpblacktoxicmoldscombleachkillmoldphp use vinegar or borax solution
whatisthisthing,not_removed,out of curiosity should you then not use bleach to clean up cat pee
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no bleach will turn the grout white again lysol will keep it from coming back for a lot longer than bleach or ammonia ever will
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bleach doesnt kill mold unless its on nonporous material this is not its in a crack that most likely is in grout so bleach wont get rid of it completely it will discolor it and make it looks like its gone though id get a real mold cleaner to take care of this if its not done properly then it will just come back httpwwwrhinohidecomblogneverusebleachtocleanmold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just keep everything aired out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,absolutely dont mix it it will duck you up i did it once
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bleach to hot water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this kills the redditor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bleach does not kill mold you need a fungicide for that bleach will only take the pigment out of mold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bleach is a chemical and it is better to use natural mold killing products instead some good alternative mold killing products are borax and vinegar til borax and vinegar arent chemicals i wonder if the author has ever heard of dihydrogen monoxide thousands of people get killed each year by immersion in dihydrogen monoxide that chemical is so dangerous that many communities require that specially trained people be present around swimming pools and beaches to treat people in danger of getting killed by dihydrogen monoxide considering the careless edition plus the general ignorant attitude of the person who wrote it i must come to the conclusion that bleach is excellent for killing mold on porous surfaces
whatisthisthing,not_removed,which part of the glass tile and grout do you think is a porous surface
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was going to suggest the same works well and quickly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks you i appreciate the advice ill use bleach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have some mold on my wall i rubbed it off with bleach two seperate times already and it reappeared both times after a while when the weather was getting cold am i doing something wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no do not use bleach it does not kill mold on porous surfaces use vinegar or borax solution
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what you dont wanna breathe in chloramine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,alright thanks for your input i was getting kinda worried solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good point thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the mask will help though at some points the spongescourer or whatever will get drier and spores will be brushed off which can be inhaled edit its not going to kill you or anything just better off not inhaling it at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure i use it for everything it has a dilution chart on the side of the bottle to tell you how much water to add depending on what youre cleaning the only warning i have ever seen is not to use full strength on glass if the cat box was really bad i would soak it with soap and water and maybe some bleach but for in between touch ups a spray of awesome and some paper towels is fine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,even yourself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,including the crab
whatisthisthing,not_removed,removed by user
whatisthisthing,not_removed,even chuck norris
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good old bleach and ammonia it kills whats wrong with you by killing whats right with you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the tiles look like possibly marble in which case be careful what you put on vinegar may etch it httpwwwmarblegranitescomresourcecentercareandmaintenancedosdontsofstonecareaspx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a strong hydrogen peroxide solution also works wonders just remember to use gloves
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my preferred method is a cup hydrogen peroxide a tablespoon of castille or dish soap and a couple tablespoons of baking soda mix and add some water until you have a workable cleaning solution dip your cleaning brush in it and go to town dont try to clean this with a sponge op
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you do use vinegar be aware that getting a sudden craving for french fries is perfectly normal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,god damn every single comment should be deleted except for this one rarely do i find a nothing to add opportunity this is perfect
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah definitely dont do that bleach to clean a litter box was a horrible mistake ive made before and nearly passed out if not nearly killed myself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah dont do that it totally makes toxic fumes personally i use a product called peepee that i get at the grocery store alternatively you could use odoban
whatisthisthing,not_removed,never mix bleach with ammonia be careful joking about that without making it clear youre joking someone could actually get hurt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everyone who has ever died had dihydrogen monoxide in their bloodstream at time of death not only that but its incredibly addictive withdrawal symptoms include dehydration delirium chapped lips and death
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think tilegrout is considered porous im not super certain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tile and grout are porous surfaces which is why membrane is needed behind them in wet rooms to ensure no water seeps through in to the rest of the construction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,two possible answers that i am aware of either it is an outside wall that is colder than the rest of the room so that the humidity in the room condenses on it then you just have to see that the wall stays warmer by heating up the room and looking for a better air flow leave space between cupboards and the wall or the humidity comes from inside the wall because it is an outside wall that is not protected against rain there is a leaking pipe inside or a bathroom on the other side of the wall where too much water comes into contact with the wall if this is the case you have a bigger problem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mold consists of two types of tissue hyphae and fruiting bodies think of the hyphae as roots and the fruiting bodies as the aboveground part of a plant the black stuff is fruiting body the hyphae may well have penetrated the surface so even when you get rid of the black stuff the roots are still on there and can create more fruiting bodies later this is why mold can lead to houses getting gutted if it invades the wooden structural elements theres no way to get into a to remove it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bleach will kill the everything on the outside but wont get rid of the mycelium in the wall it basically works for hours until the chlorine evaporates then you just wet the drywall which will cause more to grow dont use bleach on porous surfaces
whatisthisthing,not_removed,concrobium is something you may want to look into httpconcrobiumcomfaq
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also if the mold is on a porous area bleach wont kill it you can clean it with vinegar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,something else to consider bleach kills mold but it doesnt keep it from growing back borax will keep it from coming back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is grout porous oops use hydrogen peroxide mixed with vinegar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you ever get gooey pics share them im hungry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the real pro tip is in the comments

whatisthisthing,not_removed,good to know i literally just bought some sponges lol ill go and buy a brush
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not in the us sidenone dont clean mold with ketchup
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have some bleach and considered using it but last time i opted for a watervinegar solution scrubbing cleaning up then layering with baking soda and letting it sit for awhile was just curious if the ammonia in cat pee was strong enough to react with bleach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i guess it can be if its not sealed it should be sealed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an outside wall so i guess itll be the first one thanks for the help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a solid concretebrick wall though theres a very light spot remaining on the plaster after rubbing the mold off the mold itself is offwhitelight yellowishgreen can it still grow roots in that or am i just not thorough enough

whatisthisthing,not_removed,huh thank you but i dont know if this is a good idea this is a vibrator from a porn movie i cant find any littlest pet shop vibrator though

whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive made an interesting observation with this in my country this truck is seen always either in construction sites or being towed by a trucktowtruck i poundered about it and one day i noticed that these pumps did not have any license plats at all then it hit me it would be much more expensive to pay for a truck lisence you see in my country a simple toyota car would cost almost what a posche would cost in the us than to just pay for tow service since it spends most of its time in a contruction site and rarely on the road
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ha the guy holding the hose ive heard guys call this job swingin dicks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why does it look so long and spindly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats even more amazing is that you can chain them together to make it even longer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it even has a huge great big truck full of concrete at the back of it giving you a hint
whatisthisthing,not_removed,friggin amazing you da real mvp thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solid info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is it mark as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey hey i knew that one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres a company called schwing who also make concrete pumps apparently having a silly name is a prerequisite for making such machines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmmmm may have to change my username
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you got to walk down a slope luxury we had to walk uphill degrees both ways in the snow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pumpin mud is that what the kids are calling it nowadays
whatisthisthing,not_removed,through the snow without shoes then washed your clothes in the river we used phones with cord back in my day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are pure money making machines though if you need a concrete pump there really is no other reasonable alternative in north america at least
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in your country you are in singapore amirite
whatisthisthing,not_removed,trailers dont have license plates in your country wheres that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the purpose behind that is to be able to push concrete to places that arent accessible to the regular cement truck which may be high or may be far off to the side of where a truck can get to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you cant always get a concrete truck in the spot you want it usually the back of a building or house and having a heavy hose running thru your site is not only time consuming to clean but also set up and break down this solves all these problems
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it can reach up several floors or over obstructions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they call it a soup kitchen just a lotta ds in as
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its pretty neat to watch it pouring pillars at the top of and story buildings
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not sure why youre being downvoted geenrationgoogle cant figure stuff out without rwhatisthithing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mark it solved bro
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tell that to liebherr there is nothing silly about the german name liebherr germans dont do silly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive always thought thats where the waynes world thing came from schwing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,snow well we had it tough we had to balance three buckets one on top of our heads mind through a field of hot boiling lava uphill both ways hours a day all while singing the national anthem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we only walked down because the road uphill was closer to the collar we were pouring to stabilize a water line otherwise yes we would have been walking uphill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,luxury we had to eat snow for breakfast and call each other using smoke signals
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh absolutely id say maybe the revenue is in the millions for a company thats using one they own id say those are rented or contracted from a pump and mix only company
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol no trailers have license plates only cement pump trucks did not have any license from singapore and im assuming trailer refers to the ones that carries containers and is pulled by a prime mover or tractor or idk what you would call it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,apparently people really hated my post or they really hate daddy long legs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,concrete truck httpsenwikipediaorgwikireadymixconcrete actually httpsenwikipediaorgwikicement is the powder which when mixed with water binds the sand and aggregate together to form httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconcrete and these days it is only one of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikipozzolan which is used
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there was space around our house to drive through to the back to pour a foundation but the contractor did not want to risk driving the heavy cement truck down our driveway im afraid it would crack it yeah lets not do that thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,love dirty mike and the boys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rlewronggeneration
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thought the same thing no one ever told me what it does the powers of deductive reasoning are a lost artform
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just got off mobile complied with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doesnt that translate to manlove not that theres anything wrong with that adolescent snicker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was the first thing i thought of when i saw the name
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pfft you dont know the meanin of hard work back when we were were layin the slab for a shopping center on the sun we were made to mix the concrete by hand with a lead spoon of the soup variety mind you took thirty years to produce a yard but damn if it wasnt the best lookin concrete from there to mars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i hate the term daddy long legs because of its many varied meanings depending on region sometimes it means cellar spider sometimes harvestmen sometimes crane fly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,many pipelines need to be cleaned out sometimes just when theyre installed eg irrigation lines and sometimes regularly as in this case the general process is called httpsenwikipediaorgwikipigging of which cleaning is just the simplest form where you push a pig through the line that forces out any foreign material the video already posted is more similar to this particular machine but its missing the best part of any pig cleanout the end httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdgdlcqzkkdu
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive never seen one cleaned but if its like the cement trucks they just run water through it until the cement doesnt have any ability to stick any more when cement sets its not just drying out theres a chemical reaction involved dilute the wet cement enough and theres really nothing left of it but sand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup cement comes in bags concrete comes in trucks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good thing this is abductive reasoning not deductive reasoning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre doing the lords work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lovemr if were being literal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,niceman more like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lovely mr would be more accurate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have never referred to a crane fly as a daddy long leg i always thought they were giant mosquitoes until i looked them up just now but the first two you mentioned are both daddy long legs to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,welcome to the loud part of youtube
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the sponge being sucked in was oddly satisfying to watch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but wheres the ball coming out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good ole alberta
whatisthisthing,not_removed,anyone have an id on the dubstep track playing over this vid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey thats how we clean the lines out at a winery too thanks i did wonder how that worked
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also known as shooting the pig
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey thanks something i always wondered about but never thought would be on youtube
whatisthisthing,not_removed,first time i saw a pig being used to clean pipes it was from this video i imagine the smell was something special
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually what he said makes sense these pumps are for places you cant get a cement truck like up several floors on a building site or behind a house with no drive access
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure youre wrong a cement truck delivering cement is an absolute that most people should know deduced from the cement truck dumping its cement into the pump and it being delivered at the other end of the nozzle we can deduce that it is a cement pump but nice use of big a big word you clearly know nothing about
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dearsir fits better imo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,which is funny because like of youtube are way too quiet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking about how loud the video was but still forgot to mention it in the post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sounded like every edm song ive ever heard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,brrrrrmm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats loud i used to do safety watch for a guy who climbed in the back of mixer trucks and air chisseled the dried concrete out sitting next to a portable air compressor listening to that for hours on end now that is loud
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was hoping to see the sponge ball pop back out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you misspelled ever
whatisthisthing,not_removed,deductive reasoning requires a complete set of facts which would have to include knowledge of the pump in the truck existing if you knew that the pump existed the reasoning would be cement is being delivered to the machine the machine contains a pump and cement is coming out the other end of the machine the individual evidence are facts and point to one possible conclusion you could deduce that the machine is a cement pump if you see the cement truck delivering cement to a machine and cement coming out the other end of the machine you can make an inference that the machine includes a pump there are other less likely means and processes which could be occurring within the machine that you cannot see from a distance or without knowledge of its internal workings thus that the machine is a cement pump is the most likely answer but not the only possible answer that is abductive reasoning and that is what people would use to determine what the machine is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,which isnt funny because that causes us to have our volume turned up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so on average pretty good i suppose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i said the new winch is qui
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nobody make a smell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tell me you used hearing ppe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah bastard even says there it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe we should let ze germans sort him out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this convinces me of nothing the means by which the cement is delivered from one end of the machine to the other is irrelevant pumps pump in many different ways the argument isnt the means of which the cement is getting from one end to the other the question was not how but what
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sometimes its still too quiet at max volume especially if the recording is noisy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we did was still loud
whatisthisthing,not_removed,please no
whatisthisthing,not_removed,however if op doesnt actually see concrete going into that machine and concrete coming out the other end she is without some facts whether or not you believe op should have deduced it also even after i knew what concrete pumps were i would wonder why they would need such ridiculously long segments to pump the concrete horizontally when you could just drive right up to the pour area later i realized that you are sometimes not able to drive just anywhere on a build site
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe you are seeing something i am not seeing i can not see the cement coming out of the truck for all you can actually see in the pic they could have parked it there they could be cleaning it or staging it i also can not see the concrete coming out the other end
whatisthisthing,not_removed,use vlc you can set the volume to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,booooo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is correct i have never seen concrete go into or out of the machine i did note the cement truck parked near the machine but assumed incorrectly that it was merely staged there as i have seen concrete poured in the area without the use of a pump
whatisthisthing,not_removed,on a youtube video
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup get the nonshortened url and pop it into file open network
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a connecting joint to some sort of indoor structure possibly a small standing shelf with rods some sort of put together yourself furnitureunit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would guess that spike would be clamped between two pieces of wood that rotted away that sun would hold it in place and the rays would ensure that it would fold out at ° increments ive no idea what it is though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a part of a float valve for a livestock water this arm attaches between the float and the valve the rays are raised detente to adjust the float height to close the valve when the water reaches a certain height in the water trough raised on a farm and have adjusted lots of these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perhaps a garden bulb marker gardeners like to keep track of where things were planted bulbs go dormant and disappear over winter and the marker is a reminder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might be on the right track perhaps a broken gnomon from a sundial pointed or arrow shaped gnomons were common once
whatisthisthing,not_removed,similar to this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you have brass rods or steel steel would rust quick in water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah that makes sense i know nothing about gardening
whatisthisthing,not_removed,brass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my other thought was a seed dibber but theyre usually fatter theyre used to make a nice impression in the soil to drop a seed into theres all kinds of plant markers though and it seems the most likely

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am hoping someone can help identify the exact model number or at least brand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a onie or one hitter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is that an older joe rogan
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this isnt a crack pipe lmao its a chillumonehitter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks more like a hollow metal tube such as would be used for wind chimes than any pipe it could i suppose be one of those ecigs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,confirming crack pipe youd put a bit of choreboy in the end opposite your mouth then your rocks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe it is a wvapes disposable electronic thc wax concentrate pen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,crack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks ill look that up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is just normal joe rogan
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay that i did not expect
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not saying i know from experience of using a crack pipe myselfbut i do have knowledge that people that use crack use parts of telescopic antenea windshimes metal pens anything that is of the sufficient size and can withstand the immense amounts of heat that are put on to the smoking device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i hope thats not one of the rollers from your desk drawer does it still open properly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be literally anything drawer roller piece of housekeepings vacuum
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my rollerblades have bearings like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,depending on what type of material you are actually referring to it looks like you are talking about something like a or a both are manmade products that involve flakes or different pieces of material glass stone plastic etc in a binder such as cementresinetc that makes a large solid surface or can be made into tiles etc with this speckled appearance the rubber tiles you referenced are mainly meant to mimic this appearance but obviously have a much more resilient texture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also this used to see it on recycled material in the does this pattern or style have a name
whatisthisthing,not_removed,confetti mosaic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a melamine plateconfetti

whatisthisthing,not_removed,was hoping for something more specific but i might be out of luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,infrared transmitter and receiver for stock control or smart shelf labels the ones i have installed looked just like this transmit leds are around the edge and reflect out receive sensors are in the center httpwwwpricercomensolutionsstoremanagesolutions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont be embarrassed i have trouble reading a tape measure sometimes so i always refer to httpiimgurcomjasxterjpg hold your piece to the very left edge of your tape measure and refer to the breakdown above on your own tape
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its impossible to tell from a picture because the fact that the tape measurer is behind the screw changes the perspective id go to an automotive store or a hardware store and present the screw they will pull out a and that will tell you the tpi and whether it is metric or not ideally you live in a big enough town that there is a specialty hardware store not a big box store with clueless associates that has aisles and aisles full of teeny tiny bins of every single screw and bolt known to man if not simply checking the threads per inch with a thread pitch guage should narrow it down enough that you can figure out the diameter and order it online if you find that the tpi is metric then you can rule out all nonmetric bolts and vice versa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its probably a bolt not a screw looks like coarse thread are you in the usa imperial vs metric
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup or coarse thread if imperial
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might just do that i am in the us so it is likely imperial the tape measurer is adjacent to the bolt which still isnt perfect but it was the best i could think of while my sofa was upended
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agree x
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is what it was based on the lowes associate thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the us yes its a leg from my sofa which i understand is usually its made in china though bought from a major american store target
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i second the closest metric size is and that has a finer thread pitch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its made overseas it is likely metric thats been my experience what i do is take it to home depot or lowes and try it in nuts until one fits then thats your size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its made overseas it is likely metric ha shouldnt everything be metric then china makes plenty of nonmetric shit for the us market sometimes if you buy cheap enough stuff theyll give you a nice mix of fasteners because its what was lying around ive always found the local hardware stores true value ace etc have better selections of loose nuts and bolts and usually sizing guides to help you narrow it down more quickly and figure out thread pitch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,related equipment used for keeping track of inventory though rfid systems
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe it said zebra on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah yeah thats definitely what it is solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your link does not work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like brass bearing race clamps possibly from a magneto
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im suspicious that the yellow color is some sort of surface treatment or coating especially since the nuts and bolts are the same color nonsteel nuts and bolts are somewhat uncommon check to see of the parts are magnetic if youre really determined to find out try scratching the surface to see if its a different color underneath you might also be able to see bare metal on the threads on the bolts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not sure what the single piece is but i know it aint a stove pipe here is exactly what your two columns are edit found it it is a part of the scales look at on this video
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more pics pillars were found in the same location with a lot of other stuff dont know if they go together but they appear to have similar decoration httpimgurcomabeles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like it may be a pipe that would go on top of a cast stove or a chimnea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep its a pipe for a chimenea the two lines at the top of the first pipe you posted is where the top roof attached to keep water from entering in the event of rain had a round hatlike piece of metal on top and then mesh around the sides to allow the smoke to exit while keeping rain out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well shit nice find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved wow i am beyond blown away amazing find thanks you now i need to get back into that nook and figure out if the rest of the pieces are there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thought you might want to see my post on this thread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im curious to know the process in which lead you to find this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i worked in a factory that had areas built in there was a variation of the columns with a part of the scale still attached just had to look for vintage scales google did the rest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gotcha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rwhatisthispainting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,erm what kinda info do you want the picture of the company name is blurry and thats probably the only thing we can tell you it does not look old as in antique it looks like it was made in the last ten years edit clarified a bit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks to me like a more modern card intended to look old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well it is hallmark and from at least the judging from what family member it is addressed to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it didnt look it anyways from first glances but if it is then thats your answer as far as info on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would agree with it being late but im also not clear on why you posted it here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikimicrometer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats an outside micrometer they have manuals on the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an additional picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a micrometer ive never used a nondigital one though so i have no idea how to read it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,starrett thats a decent brand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as already said its a micrometer shows an easy way to read it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,each turn of the handle is thousands and each mark on the main part is one turn so you add them up then add the number on the handle at the line this is showing thousand or inches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,man i learned to use a very similar one many moons ago those things can be so accurate you cant hold them for long or the heat from your hand makes the metal expand enough to throw them off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,great cant upload a photo 😑
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like vacuum moisture extraction pads for flood remediation edit also after reading how they do it it is not vacuum extraction they inject super dry air into the floor to absorb the water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it connect to anything at the other end
whatisthisthing,not_removed,radon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh greatthats pretty interesting ill mark as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but arent those floor tiles in ops picture isnt the whole point of tiling that it is water resistant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i followed the hoses to a big machine that had super air dryer floor moisture removal system printed on the side so nm i guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not terrazzoits rough rather than polished and the seams arent inlaid metal strips but are rather groutedsorry the photo doesnt make it more clear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwschenckandcompanycomarticlewaterdamagewecanfixthat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these could be carpet tiles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,forgot to log into your other account
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why do those even exist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry not carpet tiles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah im not op is jokes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cheap and easy to replace but gives a carpet floor if your a public place a lot of gross stuffdamage can happen to the floor if it cant be fixed you can just pull and replace one tile
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh im dumb
whatisthisthing,not_removed,psst that wasnt the op
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shh bby is ok
whatisthisthing,not_removed,didnt think claim or care that it was

whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thank you solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for a dealership to keep track of keys and vehicles the top portion goes on the windshield of a car the bottom portion would be attached to keys in the office
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for a while after i first got my car when it was cold you could see the marks from the suction cups they presumably used to install the windscreen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe i should add some more context its a ford escape and ive had it since last winter though i cant remember if this happened last year or not i feel like i should have remembered if it did so they went away when the windshield was fully defrosted but appeared again the next night when it had frosted over again there hasnt been another frost yet this year the car is parked overnight at a hospital where i work nights the numbers are forward facing from outside of the car so the inside view is backwards the image i posted is not flipped my google fu isnt strong enough thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ubasshertzmyears is right its a stock number from the car dealership you bought it from source work at a dealership
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup stock number from dealership
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these are on my glasses as well theyve got the company name printed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure but its a color in hex
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mysterious could be a serial number for company car if it was used as the previous user was working in this company hope you get it solved soon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have similar markings on my rear window from a sticker that the previous owner had in there i bought the car used and ive had it for years and nothing gets rid of those markings they still show up whenever its a bit frosty how can i get rid of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that the laser tracking numbers for stolen vehicle recovery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why can i only see them if the windshield frosts over
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahh that explains the circles that i get on my cars rear window
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fwiw similar experience with a used car some years back local body shop friend had a glass polishcompound that worked to remove the residue as all other methods alcohol razor back windshield with defroster so i couldnt use one googone etc failed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol thats what happened when i googled it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ha thats not the right answer but youre right it does fit the mold for a color written in hexadecimal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there was an adhesive around the numbers to keep it affixed to the window which left a residue the adhesive is transparent but when the car frosts the residue reacts slightly differently slightly more hydrophobichydrophilic than the rest of the window
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres some residue left over from the sticker clean your windshield both sides
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because a ghost put them there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try things like goo gone to remove it possibly a steel wool or if youre brave a razor blade with plenty of lubricant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you tried washing your window wproduct intended to remove sticky residue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah dude youve narrowly avoided being pulled into the sea by a giant carken
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my old school used to have a massive concrete s in a yard that was sort of glued to the floor they took it away because it was dumb but every time it snowed afterwards the footprint of the s was still there as a patch of melted snow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i got a car in high school that did not have ac about months later it was cold out and the windows fogged up but were hard to clear without because of no ac thats when i found out the previous owner had dolphin stickers all over the back windows that had been removed before selling the car i tried and tried but never could get those shapes to go away on cold days it was almost as if the glue had altered the glass kind of embarrassing for a year old boy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and it looks so much better than the wax pens they used to use i had a huge string of hand written numbers that would only show up with condensation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont even need to do both sides the stickers are always attached on the interior side of the window so you could still wash cars and they wouldnt come off with snow or other bad weather just using rubbing alcohol on the inside of the windshield will get all that residue off i guess it doesnt hurt to give a good cleaning of the outside as well though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try things like goo gone to remove it possibly a steel wool or if youre brave a razor blade with plenty of lubricant ill take bad cosmo sex advice for alex
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the things you miss when youre playing pokemon go and not watching the road
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can make that yourself httpwwwinstructablescomidhowtomakeraindrawingswithneverwetsuperhydro
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it does alter the glass i have seen people use acetone gasoline everything type and kind of glass cleaner and even battery acid trying to remove the residue i do not think there is any residue to remove i think it does something to the glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,once again alcohol is the real answer this stuff will clean stuff other window cleaners wont use this if your window has any oil contamination use the good stuff find rubbing alcohol or use denatured alcohol wear gloves do your skin does dry up eye protection wouldnt be a bad idea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rubbing alcohol and even a razor blade helps a lot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,always go to wanda for sex advice never cosmo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats about the only practical application for that stuff great novelty though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more likely it protects the glass from wear in that spot over time your windshield gets sand and dirt and shit blown across it changing the surface texture relatively evenly and not observable by the naked eye the sticker protects the glass underneath it from that wear hence different levels of hydrophobia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably etches it by being very slightly acidic maybe aided by weather
whatisthisthing,not_removed,alcohol is the real answer you dont hear that every day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres other uses or at least for something similar you can make a shirt that repels water and by extension any waterbased stains and i want to see if a hydrophobic fish tank will still get coated in algae
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is probably close to the right answer under the right circumstances glass is actually permeable to water look at glasses that have been through several cycles in the dishwasher and notice the slightly foggy character of the glass often around the lip because the glass is lipdown in the washer this is a result of heating causing the glass molecules to move far enough apart that a water molecule can fit into the spaces between once the glass cools the water is trapped this is especially true for leaded glass crystal tldr never put good glassware in the dishwasher have the servants clean them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or disintegrated the uv coating on the glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive purchased and used neverwet a few times the stuff does not adhere well to surfaces and becomes less effective when met with some sort of abrasion or disturbed in any way a shirt is a nice gimmick but it wouldnt work after wearing it a bit or after a wash it also leaves a milky color fish tank wouldnt work over time the coating would break down and be worthless plus not to mention it being harmful to the fish the stuff is straight up gimmicky fun to play with but not durable at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it coat the fishies gills as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i only saw that effect at my parents house where they used bleachbased dishwasher detergent because it was cheap using different detergent none of my glasses have had this happen its likely that some have been through the dishwasher over a thousand times and yet nadda
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this kills the fish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possible but hydrophobic means it absolutely doesnt want to mix with water so how would it get onto the fish unless someone deliberately took the fish out of the water sponged it dry and hit it with the hydrophobic spray ed i guess nemo could just brush against the tank wall but i dont know if the spray hardens or stays liquid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,only one way to know for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not sure but for some reason i want to say something to do with seat belts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a what part of the were you working on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,power steering or alternator mount bracket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,both germany and great britain raised native armies and fought with them in africa in wwi i would guess this came from these campaigns
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doesnt speak for the origins but maybe trench art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the helmet itself looks a bit like a german pickelhaube with a bunch of adornment removed or damaged but no idea if it really it one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was my thought too captured from a germam colony in africa then modified
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the design could have been inspired be the the belgian colonial troops wore in congo free statebeglian congo where the luba people live
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpspicnicclubdetroitcomabout according to google image search every indexed image similar to the logo on the tire cover is on a page that relates to some event of the association linked above
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,now im just trying to figure out where you are based on the surroundings haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,metallic gasket for a piping flange
whatisthisthing,not_removed,made of plastic and metal approx diameter no markings browsed drafting tools on google images without luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,concur we sell these at work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i looked at a few and think you two may be correct is it normal to have the metal support to keep them flatstraight before installation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes the ones we sell are for oil transport and they have to be clean perfect undamaged when installed otherwise very bad things will happen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for clarification ive marked this as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a political statement regarding police training requirements see edit this is just a guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats it im goin to barber school
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you want to make a point the best way to do it is get to the point being cryptic works every now and then but you need to capture peoples imagination and it takes time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwyourbeavercountycomtruthbehindmysteriousbarberschoolsigns dont think i solved anything though looks like its still a mystery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whatever statement they are trying to make is lost and ineffective if people still dont know what it means even after googling and serious thought
whatisthisthing,not_removed,antonio brown looking for the next lego cut
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i immediately recognized some of the landmarks in the photos at least two of the photos are in beaver county the county thats north of allegheny county and pittsburgh there is a new barber school that opened in rochester pa sometime this year and i think thats what the signs refer to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aha i saw these driving by one day but forgot about them thanks for answering a forgotten question guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyve been up since at least may
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i live in pittsburgh and see them all the time i asked myself the same thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its literally just a shitty ad for the pittsburgh barber school my gf just graduated from it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is marked as solved but i dont think that it actually is op what do you believe is the solution and why
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im so glad somebody asked this its been bugging me for month
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ayyy im from pittsburgh too and have been wondering the same thing thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,clown college you cant eat that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as a side note what going on with all the creepy political posters with stenciled white writing on a green background in pittsburgh they show up in the most unexpected places
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bill from king of the hill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the one under the lock restaurant is not really near pittsburgh though its closer to ohio than to the city
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is exactly it police generally are only in academy for a max of months in a lot of places before theyre considered fullfledged police officers whereas it could take up to years for someone to become a licensed and certified cosmetologist barber edit this kind of blew up so im going to clarify a bit although there are a lot of agencies that require at least an associates degree to get hired most only require a high school diploma in seattle where i currently live recruits attend police academy for months and then go to advanced training for weeks before theyre on the street i believe they then get paired up with an fto field training officer but im not sure for how long for the most part most police officers in the us do get a large amount of training but most complete this training in about months or so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,while i get the political connection idea this is not solved what evidence is there that these signs have any connection to police training hours it could just be a shitty ad campaign of a regional barber school
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen a few of these signs and actually saw someone putting them up i would have never guessed it was for that reason thats really obtuse and im guessing it for people in the know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its not these have been up since spring at the latest way before kaepernicks cosmetology comment source lived in pittsburgh until very recently editspelling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,classic cnn bash the police article zzzzz i guarantee nobody who works at cnn publishing these articles could even pass a police academy let alone make it through weeks most or at least mine police academies are military style ran i was trained by former marines and its not a college type course as some would think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well i dont think any of us expected him to say that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not always sometimes being cryptic makes people stop and think however most of the time a direct message is far better
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and sometimes the best one can do with the resources they have is something cryptic that will lead people to search about it online and learn about it that way which is what is happening all over this thread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why would she title her blog post the truth behind anything if she is just going to make wild speculations and assumptions about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wierd that article has the same pictures as op
whatisthisthing,not_removed,literally the first result httpswwwgooglecomsearchqpittsburghbarberschoolsigns
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow til here in germany it takes you between and years to become a police officer thats a huge discrepancy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought a lot of places required some criminal justice degree even if just a bachelors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats true but after that months which is a state requirement there is a tremendous amount more of training before you ever go out on the streets unless its a small department
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most agencies have a week field training program immediately after graduation thats where the real learning takes place standardizing andor expanding that phase of training will have a greater benefit than adding time to the academy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont get that either because it sounds misinformed everywhere ive ever inquired about employment in law enforcement has you paired up with a fto or field training officer for your first two years because youre still a rookie and that time is considered on the job training
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very possible that this was a common enough sentiment before kaepernicks comment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ukedavo linked someone asking this months ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,police being trained by military personnel sounds like a very bad thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you say that like its a good thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i looked at it had no clue what it was referencing and moved on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,understood mostly though they just move on and forget about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its about the journey not the destination
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe not for op google tailors its results to individual ip addressesaccounts and even so you have to be very specific even after opening your link just got me info on actual barber schools in pittsburgh and without pittsburgh it just got me local results to get google to work right you have to know what to google first
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sometimes people will do or say anything to delegitimize a point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and literally the exact same pictures that are in the post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tldr licensing requirements remove competition which restrict supply this allows businesses to raise the cost of a service due to an artificial demand for that service editorial comment tying this into op the police dont have a competitor so they dont have to create artificial licensing requirements to stamp out possible competitors more of a case of the barber requirements being egregious licensing like this also could make policing attract workers who simply are unable to get out afford the proper training for other trades and likley contributes to a low standard probably a step in the right direction would be to rethink some state certifications and make them more realistic for the skill needed policing included
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here in ca the state board of cosmetology is under the board of consumer affairs theyre concerned with public health and safety they want to make sure we dont injure the public or spread disease were licensed for sanitation a good haircut is legally considered an opinion source hairdresser in ca
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably explains why you dont have many problems with your police
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a lot of police agencies only require a high school diploma or a year or so of college credit if not an associates degree but fun fact a criminal justice degree does not make you stand out above any other applicant in the hiring pool from what ive heard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is actually not true in a lot of places in seattle where i currently live you are in academy for months and then upon graduation you get weeks of advanced training and then you are out on the streets so its even less than months to complete training
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you do get paired up with an fto but its nowhere near years its probably closer to a couple of months or so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure its possible but i doubt it maybe its just cheap advertising for the barber school of pittsburgh just dont leap to the conclusion its some overt civil rights protest and then pat yourself on the back after you do it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i assume you want police to use the power of hugs and love to stop criminals lol k
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exactly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its about the journey page hits not the destination ftfy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first result thats not an ad is an explanation of the signs httpwwwyourbeavercountycomtruthbehindmysteriousbarberschoolsigns
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you forgot to add signs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,licensing requirements remove competition which restrict supply this allows businesses to raise the cost of a service due to an artificial demand for that service this is a typical business model for a lot of minor professions sadly a lot of it has just become a means to sell student loans
whatisthisthing,not_removed,many places require that police officers have college degrees in a relevant field probably pretty wise
whatisthisthing,not_removed,licencing the state takes one of your rights away then sells it back to you try being a contractor in oregon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,police should have a competitor the reason being well dan cummings sums it up pretty good in his department of caffeinated beverages bit anyway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is also a crazy amount of chemistry that goes into it if peeks at my high school friends cosmetology textbook hold true it would not do to give people chemical burns whilst dyingperming their hair its just to squeeze out competition kind of ignores a lot of what cosmetologists do still pales in comparison to legally killing people or helping to send them to prison for the rest of their lives obviously
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah but why require students to learn everything before they can do anything food service in california has a significantly better safety record than homecooked meals yet it only takes a few hours to pass an online course to get a food handlers certificate the real success story in good safety is the inspections not the training why not require a quick online hair handlers certificate course then have inspections to ensure safety
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that compares it to cosmetology training which weve established is pretty overboard i could fly a passenger plane with hundreds of passengers as captain with fewer hours of experience
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well we do have a police scandal every now and again but nothing compared to the problems you seem to have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes but the you start field training and that will last up to months in most cases sometimes more then probation for a year which means you are constantly monitored much more than months
whatisthisthing,not_removed,true i didnt mean to sound so certain it was just a guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it was advertising barber school thered at least be a number when someone advertises we buy cars in the ghetto they at least leave a number
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looking at your posting history basically i want people smarter than you being police
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hahaha oh my god your post history is hysterical
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it worked exactly as intended instead of the one person seeing the sign and moving on it raised a question leading to reddit which led to all of us now aware of the message
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you actually read it because that link is to some blogger being confused by the signs as well and offering her help by listing the local barber schools
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you trolling or do you seriously not understand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and major medicine is the worst offender why are doctors overbooked overworked and some specialities overpaid because ama controls both the licensing of new doctors and medical schools they control the throttle on how many mds are minted all the way down to the lab folks of clinical lab work is feeding a sample into an instrument that produces a binary answer a child could do it but your not allowed unless you go through one of a handful of licensing programs as a result in some states they pull figures
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had a sociologist prof up at suny make a pretty convincing case it also goes on with mds the american medical association
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in pittsburgh where these signs are an equivalent of an associates degree is required in college education to even apply for the academy meaning approximately years of college minimum to even be considered for officer training
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres about new police scandals a day here it seems like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probation is not training and ive never heard of field training lasting more than months so you maybe under supervision for a very long time but your actual training stops after about months
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ya you would think at the same time tho youd think if it was a social justice thing there would be a website or something for people to get more info too and these signs would be popping up in san fran houston charlotte new york detroit etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those signs have been up for months i totally ignored them after a while and had zero naught nil interest in looking more into them if i would have not seen this reddit post i would still be in the dark and i bet i could ask every person i my office and over wouldnt have a clue what it means so good job
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually you got me serves me right for not rtfa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i also had the same thought that you didnt add signs to your search
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i assisted in an inhouse lab for a large doctors office that had around doctors its not quite that simple but your description is more accurate than exaggeration i could have been running the lab after months to a year but a lot of the bloodwork is done by a machine that is only slightly more complex to run than a vending machine from the perspective of the guy that fills it and services it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my oldest brother went to suny in the late
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i did not know that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where are you from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in pa it takes two months of full time coursework to be allowed to braid hair
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in a truly free market i would interview said person and make the determination myself as to weather or not the person was qualified or not and get references long before he would be doing any work i dont need the government or anyone else telling me how to go about my business also i know quite a few people who never finished hs who have done quite well for themselves despite their horrible up bringing also we have a permit system in place to make absolutely sure all wiring plumbing carpentry etc gets done properly take you and your big government attitude and shove it right up your ass ps i am a contractor in oregon and the over head for just my license is approximately per year so i am working for the government until i pass the dollar mark before i am actually making any money for myself also i purposely never had kids so the only thing i will be doing in my kids room will be enjoying all my extra money and the silence and peace in my life the only sound of pitter and pattering feet i will hear will be that of asian hookers the next time find an easy parking spot you can thank me youre welcome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes youre right braiding certainly shouldnt require the same licensing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uh not in california ive taken two separate food safety tests and they each only took an hour or two
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fto can be weeks for some agencies because you get bounced around to different ftos so you can pick up on different methods and approaches when your mind is being molded i know probation isnt training but you so much as sneeze without asking its usually duly noted a job like this requires ojt more so than class to be able to handle situations instructors can only do so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but you saw this reddit post right you found out its meaning along with thousands of others who never even saw the signs me for example
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just discovered this subreddit and im in the same boat as you have seen these forever but never really cared i just assumed there was only one barber school in the area and googling it would just lead you there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,right because the previous poster already did and you can just click on that link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i develop methods and applications for a clinical instrument for a living a lot of this work is dummyproofing even so i would not be considered qualified to simply operate the damn thing in a clinical setting id have to get a license oh but my college credits are more than years old so not even allowed to apply experience and phd mean nothing night classes might fix that but theres also a mandatory month clinical rotation so id have to be okay paying for that and having no salary all to qualify me to put liquid in a tube and put that tube into a machine what a racket the hematologypathology branches of cls do require trained professionals however
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes but more is at risk no matter how easy it is vending machine screw up equals a lost and an extra walk to a cvs blood machine screw up and you could cost a life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you mean theyre not needed now that machine is a wonder of science medicine and technology that didnt exist years ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah no problem its kinda ironic this is the place where these signs are being placed because i know for a fact there are other cities and municipalities with much more lax requirements for leo jobs although im talking about city of pittsburgh police department only some of those signs may not be in city areas its hard to tell when searching for the lockhouse restaurant it would appear its up in beaver pa which is like miles from the city and definitely not ppd rochester from the sign also in one of the pictures is right next door to beaver county as well so by all over pittsburgh op really means miles upstream
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in pa it doesnt require a full cosmetology license but does require hours ie months fulltime work of coursework at a certified school of cosmetology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree that more ojt should be the norm but sadly it isnt a lot of agencies seem to want to teach more in the classroom then otj
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeh but it invalidates your point about ipspecificity being relevant in this case if you dont use the same search terms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not just medicine i will bet you that in years you are going to need some sort of year degree to work at a cannabis growing facility the trend is such that anything that pays more than minimum wage or slightly more is going to require exorbitant licensing and certifications that will require excessive schooling its a way to assure that good paying jobs go to children of welltodo families and shit jobs go to children of poor families stratification of society
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you are over sensationalizing it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually this was years ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre all over the north hills i saw one on washington blvd a bit ago i dont recall any in the city proper part of that could be that theyre just less likely not to be messed with in the city
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pittsburgh resident here can confirm firsthand spotting or of these in the various suburbs east of the city all within about hour of downtown
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no i mean a food safety test not a safeway certification a companyfunded food safety test i live in california shit takes five minutes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the agencies around me all do a pretty lengthy training and thats after a month academy which is usually hour weeks that you pay to be in and cant really work so you must save up so having longer class instruction really is difficult
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but you do use the same search terms if you click on that link you use exactly those search terms because theyre embedded in the link i went on to talk about how its likely that op didnt use the exactly those search terms but thats another part of the conversation if you use those search terms you wont necessarily get the same results as the guy going hur dur its the first result gawd if you dont use the same search terms which you absolutely might not you get even less of an answer how is this hard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybebut its still more important if i dig a hole for fence post vs digging a hole for a structure of a building im sure i would get paid more for the latter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting where i have lived on the west coast most academies only seem to last about months during which you are generally hired to attend and are paid a pretty damn good wage otj training seems to last about months and then youre on your own
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should point out the that first result doesnt even explain what the signs are for making the whole google search argument moot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,collectible display probably teaspoons edit okay not teaspoons they usually use thin slots to hang the spoons vertically still looks like things lean in the hollow slots though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe some form of test tube rack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are racks large enough for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking something like pez dispensers the right shape for it anyway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wine glass racks to suspend wine glasses upside down under a cabinet they could also be aa antique spoon collection holder guess would be some type of shelving
whatisthisthing,not_removed,challenge coin holder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pipe rack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a press perhaps for removing the seeds and skins from the tomatoes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more photos httpimgurcomuwxmaqc sorry for formatting issues im using a not so great app for reddit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,potato ricer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aka
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah yeah might be good for the tomato seeds we were thinking it was probably intended for tomatos or something similar doesnt look like it would be for citrus or potatoes thanks for the link ill check that out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,except substantially smaller with holes on the sides and made for tomatoes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,many potato ricers have holes on the sides and looks pretty close to ops
whatisthisthing,not_removed,worked in commercial kitchens for over years ive never used a ricer with holes in the sides ops is so small you couldnt fit a potato in it im not saying they dont exist but ops is not a potato ricer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,grandma had one just like that we used it for potatoes and apples come pie season these things work on tomatoes i assumed the seeds would go right through
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont believe its as small as you think it is maybe the angle of ops pic is making you think its smaller than it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rhelpmefind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably part of a httpsenwikipediaorgwikitoppingout considering how the building appears to be under construction where are you located topping out celebrations are more of a european thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,topping out usually a celebration but that looks like premature exexpectations
whatisthisthing,not_removed,topping out celebration
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in america its an ironworkers thing happens when the last beam has been placed the only time it doesnt happen this way is around christmas when a tree with christmas lights has been put on top of a building no matter what stage of construction its in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen them here in south florida i love the idea being in architecture traditions like this are great
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty common here in texas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oklahoma ive never seen it before
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no it happens when the last beam has been placed nothing premature about this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in new england its a timberframers thing and has been forever according to some of my friends whoever places the tree is supposed to drink a cup of rum while up there too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have noticed these on top of underconstruction buildings many times thanks for the information
whatisthisthing,not_removed,carpenters do it also i keep forgetting though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very nice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes i first learned about this as a timberframing tradition and only later learned that ironworkers also seem to do this with some regularity
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a charm showing the characters xuan tong tong bao it was inspired by a coin issued under emperor puyi regnal name xuantong who ascended the throne at years of age when the dowager empress cixi died in in the throne was abdicated in favor of the republican revolutionaries sun yatsen

whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like optical mounting posts

whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed the other looks like steel cut oats actually the bottom one does look more like flax seeds as uholypapalsmear said
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you all flax seeds and steel cut oats i may have to get out the instant pot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a friend with celiacs and these are staples when she is visiting us
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could see it being that as well didnt seem quite dark enough for those on my phone but on my tablet the colour reads differently
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does she have any recipe recommendations i would hate to waste or ruin these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,before you cook them open the bags and smell them are they smelling rancid the flax seeds are basically a fat additive for vegans and can go off when theyre staying here this is what i do toast the oats on a baking tray until they get a bit golden but do not burn better to undercook than overcook boil cups water in a pot then add cup of toasted oats flax seeds tbsp maple syrup cup applesauce tsp salt tsp cinnamon simmer on low for minutes covered stirring occasionally if there is still water can cook a few minutes longer then serve with brown sugar and raisins on top if diet allow adding a bit of milk or cream is also tasty

whatisthisthing,not_removed,my speakers will play echoes of the last song i played even when the computer is hibernating particularly limp bizkits behind blue eyes no i am not making that up nor am i crazy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you live in an apartment it kinda sounds like a kid practicing the recorder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,honestly for a few seconds after the beginning it sounded like sandstorm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think this is it my mom says my elderly neighbor has some ham radios and an antenna in his backyard thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when i was a kid my grandmother lived very close to the local radio station with a big antenna her beds were all mattresses on top of those really old metal bedsprings i always swore i could hear talking and music when we slept over but my brother on the cot said i was nuts i bet it was this interference thanks im sending him that article
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very close but its ham radio for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would agree you are in the right realm wires can get rf transmissions induced in them if they are spaced exactly right could be any range of rf interference they are picking up ferrite cores over the wires would probably attenuate the interference if it didnt then its internal imho
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my computer and my stereo i unplugged my computer from it and the sound continued
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they really like limp bizkits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just a fyi you can approach the neighbor and say that his operating is interfering with your equipment dont be a jerk about it or give a condescending rude tone ask himher how you can work together to solve this you might be doing himher a favor because there is a possibility that something is wrong with their antenna unless this has been going on for years hams are generally nice people that are willing to help out even more so knowing that heshe is causing interference however you might get the rare ham that has a stick up their ass he or she might tell you tuff shit and to pound sand even though they might be the jerk they are correct your amplified computer speakers have to meet fcc specs and one of them is about accepting such interference interference is more an issue than ever now that you can directly import electronic goods from china to save on production costs things like shielding and rfiemi eliminationreduction are overlooked there is a lot of noisy electronic goods flooding the market as i ham i have to deal with it all the time if you dont want to approach your neighbor that is fine there are steps you can take to remedy the situation without ever having to deal with the neighbor could be as simple as coiling up extra cable to difficult as winding toroids here are some articles talking about your issue httpwwwaudioholicscomaudiovideocablesbulletproofingyoursystemfrominterference httpwwwstevelarkinsfreeukcomcomputerinterferencehtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is what you should send him httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwlw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is something in the vicinity of the speakers — or plugged in to the same circuit breaker or sharing the same ground wire — as the speakers which is inducing a voltage in the wires that move signal to the speakers or the power lines for the speakers youll want to try getting some ferrite beads from an electronics supply store frys and snap them onto the power supply lines and the auxiliary cable to the computer if youve got an inkjet printer this sounds a great deal like the kind of calibration calisthenics an inkjet printer will occasionally go through perhaps a flatbed scanner might do the same the little flat sweep semiquavers between some of the extended tones make me think its a stepper motor of some sort so possibly an external hdu connected by usb

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just tapped it out and most of my coworkers know morse so you just made my day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why are people downvoting this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is your job where most of your coworkers know morse code
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how do you tap a long tone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reddit was removing any posts with the f word it seems like it no longer is so i rewrote my post like above people dont seem to agree oh well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably military
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in telecommunications aka phone company at least a few people will know it i once saw two guys having a heated discussion over some trivial matter i whistled fags the guys who laughed knew morse code
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im in the navy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the length of the intervals between taps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we use scratches for dashes and taps for dots tapping on something with cloth like our clothes or the marching hats we all have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hooyah
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is because a lot of telco guys are exmilitary
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting but how do you indicate a pause between charswords then or is it omitted and people know that eee is supposed to be an s genuinely curious
whatisthisthing,not_removed,navy coast guard i know army and marines dont use it at any capacity not too sure about air force
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is actually
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its been about years since i did morse regularly for ham radio but there are recognized procedural signs prosigns to indicate end of word end of transmission or whatever i assume those havent changed for anyone still using a key the computer age changed the sending of code considerably so there are probably a whole collection of signs for line feed and such that im ignorant of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,certain parts of the navy still use it its not part of my job but i picked a little up along the way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,highly surprising what job still reaches morse code in the military navy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was ham radio a hobby of yours or i am and i like to repair old vacuum tube radio receivers and electronics and usecollect old telephones i have two tube testers my main one being a superior instruments co model emissions tester i love testing tubes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes navy but only a relatively small portion at that im lucky enough to run with a few
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was for awhile i was introduced to it in boy scouts and then i was in the ham radio club in high school got away from it in college being too busy with other things and too broke
whatisthisthing,not_removed,then youll love these subreddits the link below is to my multireddit with ramateurradio relectronics and a few other related subs httpswwwredditcomuserdmyertymhamradio
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that is cool i wish my school still had a ham radio club so i could meet some people with similar interests
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow and yes i love those subreddits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wish wed had a computer club but they would have had to convert the gym
whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha yep i dont like gym anyways so and i wonder how many vacuum tubes it would take to get one of those running most of my tube radios either have set or tubes i also have a few tube testers to test them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rwhatsthisbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just a guess but when i see a roller stand woodworking is the first thing that comes to mind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it could be part of an old long belt drive that goes up a hill but not really enough context to go on here whats in the area around this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,since its next to a road how about a roller for a large gate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it actually bolted down to something or are those boltheads just decorative bolts rusted off at this point seems way too heavy overbuilt for woodworking for comparison consider not impossible could be the builder used what was on hand but something that is anchored in four places and could easily weigh pounds is serious overkill for most woodworking tasks edit on further thought i like woodworking even less if it were a support for dimension lumber or large sheets of stuff a primary requirement would seem to be that it is adjustable or portable this is neither of those things it is solidly mounted on steel beams such that it cannot move in x y or zaxes ie is built to resist a lot of stressforce in anyall directions my money is now on the conveyor belt theory above
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought was for something related to cattlelivestock like a salt lick roller
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could you tell us where you found this what citystate and the general geography at the top of a hill bottom of a valley etc if its new england you cant rule out old ski lift equipment if the terrain makes sense
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks heavy duty maybe for winching could it be from a well walk carefully in either direction along the line a rope would passa and see if you dont any more components
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my best guess is an individual roller conveyor piece
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any power lines over head
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks too small and too new to be from a sawmill im thinking it was part of some rigging for something that was erected in the area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seconded itor at least the stand looks pretty home made just welded together from cut up ubars with essentially nothing in the way of finishing or rounded corners etc still its pretty heavyduty i think its very likely it came from some old sawmill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this looks exactly like the feed guide roller to old time board planing machines you feed the rough cut board into the machine and it turns it into a finished board probably internal to the machine any markings or stamps that are legible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah just cause its wooded now doesnt mean that it always was im seeing a lot of new growth trees in the background you can be surprised how quickly a space can change in a few years especially if its been seeded for trees
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all we have to go on is that the roller rolls perpendicular to the road its near old fences and looks to be bolted down my money is on you friend
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah im thinking a winch of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah looking at it again its too small to come from a real sawmill but it could well be something thrown together for someones smalltime operation my grandfather who was really into carpentrybuilt furniture professionally for most of his working life and wasnt about to stop just because of minor details like retirement cut most of his own wood on a table saw with the aid of a roller not entirely unlike this one just fitted on a special mount in the windowsill of his shedworkshop instead of a welded metal stand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i could see someone using something like this when they create their own boards from logs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually i worked to restore a sawmill that was almost a hundred years old it looks like a roller from a small sawmill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are some pretty fantastic looking welds for being homemade
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whoever did it subscribes to the more is better approach looks like he used about twice as much filler as necessary home made doesnt necessarily mean ugly welding though if you know how to weld itll look nice whether its home made or commercially made
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure i didnt mean to imply otherwise normally homebrew equipment doesnt usually end up looking so productioncreated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it was productioncreated they wouldnt use what appears to be allthread as the shaft and certainly not let it stick out as far as it does on either side it was probably made in a shop but as a oneoff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a press for rivets or grommets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also used to secure the wristbands at festivals
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt see the second one at first it might be for those rivet buttons on jeans and overalls i think theyre called bachelor buttons sometimes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a gutter guard to keep leaves out is it nailed down forming the degree if yes maybe they put them to mark out a spot where something will go
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gutter screenguard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are nailed to the ground and have been there for months
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeh still pretty sure its gutter guard for what reason they have it nailed like that and in multiple spots only they could tell ya me thinks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely gutter guard and a survey was probably done marking lot lines using those to mark corners for a building fence or just to denote the lot size more visible if pictures are taken from the air

whatisthisthing,not_removed,found this in my back garden in northern ireland was just sort of sitting on the grass not obviously attached to anything moved it to the pavement and hit it with a shovel httpsimgurcomgalleryjypef the first thing that came to mind was like a dead wasps nest as for size its slightly smaller than a soccer ball edit a friend just suggested that it was a wasps nest that was destroyed with some wasp nest destroyer foam thoughts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a puffball maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think it is a wasp nest it may be a fungus it looks like an httpwwwfirstnaturecomfungipseudoinonotusdryadeusphp is it solid the fungus would be firm and fibrous drying to a long lasting woody mass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats a puffball edit just did a google certainly could be but its pretty big to appear almost out of nowhere and already in an apparent state of decay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its more soft inside i have a video off it ill try to upload it somewhere edit here we are note sofa is british for couch

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its almost certainly a weevil as suggested httpswwwflickrcomgroupsweevilspoolchirpyuk has hundreds of identified native british weevils if youre looking for exactly the right one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be are they common in england
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are they harmful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt know we have them in england thats so weird the nearest sand is like miles away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont know about england but they are a pest wherever cotton is grown including mexico and usa maybe it hitched a ride in a shipment of cotton
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah you could eat hundreds of them and not feel a thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know whether you have them in england or not but its not an ant lion larva
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont plan to eat it but i meant for my animals or whatever
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry please excuse my irreverence theyre no friend to crops but they dont cause any direct problem for humans or other animals they dont bite or sting

whatisthisthing,not_removed,heres a fresh idea could it be salt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like sand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its sand on an incline the weird shadowing effect is likely due to googles altitude mapping
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it have been pushed up like that by ice or do they not get ice like that in that location
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the area is there is nowhere for the land to side to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there isnt sea ice on the outerbanks of north carolina it is actually really rare to even find ice of any thickness on freshwater in the winter chances are that this was deposited by either a storm or possibly dredging of a channel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think theyd get ice in that area but it could certainly be from a storm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this area fresh water or salt i thought it would be salt water or brackish

whatisthisthing,not_removed,no problem its funny i have one of those too i happened to have bought it in russia when i was a kid and for the longest time i thought it was a weird soviet toy some marvel of communist geometry i was really surprised to find out the truth as an adult
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i think i got one as a stocking stuffer at some point you can play with it for like seconds before its boring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,however despite all of the solutions i used to work in a toy store that sold them cheaply and knew several people who did wear them in their hair
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep these were also marketed as hair decorations in the later i had one on my desk that i used as a fidget and was surprised to see them in stores with the hair stuff

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is what i came for great pics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,make it into a flying car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty neat that it has a portal axle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whatever you do dont scrap it either fix it up yourself or sell it to someone who will many farms still use these tractors on a regular basis and people will collect them they are great machines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,something about that offset axel looks so bad ass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where are you located
whatisthisthing,not_removed,western kentucky
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you dont want to fix it up advertise it for sale these tractors are getting rarer and rarer and collectors are always looking for ones that are barn fresh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the nice thing about restoring things like this is it doesnt take much more than a ssndblaster and paint
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that one is most certainly not barn fresh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it will never be for sale while im alive it belongs there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know how you use the term but by my standards it very much is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,city boy huh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think you know what barn fresh means
whatisthisthing,not_removed,suggestion put a tarp on top to keep the rain off failing that something to cover the exhaust and keep rain out of the engine if you decide you want to get it running let me know and ill point you to info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am forced to agree with mr wong on this one i usually consider a tractor barn fresh if it is running but a cosmetic mess this tractor needs four wheels just for starters you can not leave a steel wheel tractor on the dirt for any length of time it ruins the wheels i could go down the list on this tractor it could be restored at great cost and many many hours in my area this would be stripped for parts more than likely the only reason to restore a tractor in this condition would be for sedimental reasons witch i have done
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id hate to see what your girlfriend looks like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like hes got the old style tomato soup can sitting on the exhaust that being said he should probably swap it out for a new one thats alot less rusty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont worry about your lack of sedimental feelings they take years to accumulate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i always thought that the more brutalized the item the more rewarding the restoration i guess tractors are on a whole other level for how much work it can belol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wheels wheels is what it needs seriously its just a solid lump of rust all rubber is long gone and all metal fused to all other metal the only way to remove any part now is to cut it with an angle grinder it is absolutely definitely not going to run ever unless it gets a new engine that is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh damn screw it im leaving it now everyone has dirt on me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dude its not that hard to fix just takes patience also the back wheels never had tires theyre steel you soak with penetrating oil heat and hit with a hammer and keep at it shell come free no problem ive been fixing worse since i was a kid this is nothing edit also there are no new engines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually you would be surprised how easily most of the major moving parts will move again it is usually the things like the carb and the mag that will hold you up more im not saying that it would run great but i have pulled motors from worse and got them moving again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,helped my father restore an old tractor john deere model m that started in similar condition as this one its actually in pretty good condition one thing to remember with these old tractors is that alot of the parts were cast out of thick steel on them rust has a hard time penetrating and most can be blasted off only thin steel you need to really worry about as long as that engine didnt have water run into it youll probably just need a rebuild kit new carb and new generator for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre a silty silty man
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it a new one looks like part of one of the pegs that stop the drum moving in when in transit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this thing fell out of my washing machine when we moved it to a different spot it still turns on but i havent tried to do some actual washing because im unsure if its an important piece and i might accidentally flood my apartment i tried google image search but found nothing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what make and model is your washing machine

whatisthisthing,not_removed,huh i looked again and you can see the midspan clamps in the shadows so it is almost certainly cable and telco drops they probably pulled out at the terminals since it looks like the span to the house is still connected
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but are they live
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but should they electrocuted memy dog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what stuff do you do are you familiar with western electric i am and my main phone is a western electric model rotary phone from i also have an old hand crank magneto wall phone made by strombergcarlson i know how the old landline system worked and how they still work and i know the phones inside and out i also like to repair old tube radios and electronics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,telephone cables are live yes they have about while not being used while ringing and while being used the dc voltages there arent particularly dangerous the ac ones however may be be careful with them when theyre ringing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you could get a frightening jolt if you grabbed ahold of the bare copper ends of the lines and your dog could get a jolt if he chews the lines ive personally been zapped about times on telephone lines and the worst that has happened is i banged my elbow when i jerked my arm back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what do you mean by that have you been shocked or are you worried youll get shocked try to get them checked out and removed even if theyre intended for phone signals they can possibly get crossed with power wires and cause a hazard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what stuff do i do i work in downtown pittsburgh i started out doing outside plant construction mostly big underground copper cables it was a good start to understanding how the telephone network is designed for three years i worked mainly in manholes and buildings splicing and testing telephone cables i then moved into copper cable maintenance when a phone line stops working someone has to figure out why and where the problem exists and go fix it i learned a lot about ohms law old telephone facilities and irate customers doing that around i started doing fiber optic installation at that time the internet was really just going mainstream and we were running fiber to a million different startup isps they all wanted a because mbs was crazy fast at that time most of those isps are out of business now then i moved into multiplexor assembly programming and turnup around fios construction started in pennsylvania i went to philadelphia for a few months to build that out a few years later fios came to pittsburgh and i had the pleasure of assembling and programming the really fast multiplexors and fiber back bone that serve the fios network here today i mostly do multiplexor installation and maintenance for business customers western electric yeah when i first started they were still providing equipment to bell atlantic previously bell telephone now verizon there is still a lot of western electric equipment in service on our network all of it copper twisted pair based as far as ive seen there are still a few old geezers out there sharing a party line paying eleven dollars a month for two calls per day lud line and renting a western electric rotary telephone set for a dollar a month believe it or not you are etc i am so happy that there are young guys like you who are into analog electronics vintage equipment and understanding how old stuff works your from is an incredible example of the best engineering of that era and it makes me happy that someone as young as you can respect and appreciate it there is a good book called exploding the phone that i bet you would love have you heard of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,continuous for cable according to a comcast engineer i know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep i am and i like to collect old telephones and repair tube radios and electronics and my main phone is a western electric model rotary phone from my telephone magneto puts out cycleshertz to ring the ringer i have been bitten by the once while replacing one of the old ma bell pin wall jacks with a new one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that is good that you have all that experience with communications systems and that is great to hear that some western electric equipment is still in service what particular pieces of we equipment are still being used and yep there will always be a few people still using older technology i am glad actually that we telephone sets are still in use and thank you i am glad that you appreciate my interests as most people my age dont care at all and yes those in the and were the best phones made and western electric made some of the best equipment in the world their phones were built to last and built to be simple and easy to repair can sure take a beating and still work perfectly they are pretty much indestructible modern phones dont compare at all i really wish i had some friends or whatever that were into vintage electronics like i am and yes i love that book
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you would walk into a verizon central office here in pa especially one that has been around for a long time like the ones here in pittsburgh you would see western electric equipment everywhere relay racks cable heads test sets coils carbons cables splice cases switching equipment even ladders stools soldering irons and lockers i have an old rotary dial we butt set that i carry on my truck it was passed on to me by an old bell tech who mentored me when i started out these days i only have use for a butt set maybe once a year that we butt set is my goto because unlike the modern butt sets it doesnt require a battery its always ready to go
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow and yeah we made some pretty reliable butt sets i love anything western electric
whatisthisthing,not_removed,leave it alone it is a tomato hornworm and is destructive to your tomato crop but this one is the victim of a wasp that kills hornworms so what you have is a whole bunch of wasps that will seek out and kill those destructive worms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they arent on the plant they are on a caterpillar on the plant they are wasp eggs mr caterpillar is going to be eaten alive soon bye bye
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is some mid evil shit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is nature at its best
whatisthisthing,not_removed,anything you want many carmakers instead of wasting space include cubbys and storage compartments they call it a feature theyre quite handy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this would have been cut out had the version of vehicle you purchased come with rear passenger climate control as it did not you have been provided a cubby
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that makes sense
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,too small
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont think so that wasnt avaliable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably not however in some markets theres probably an ashtray mounted there it was quite common to have an ashtray there before all the antismoking stuff hit the carmakers as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,obdii port if you have the equipment it can tell you stuff about the sensors and let you clear trouble codes that make the engine light come on and such
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the port obd ii on board diagnostics port
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure the jury rigged wiring is attached to the obd port or something else and yes that sure looks like an obdii port
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is certainly an odb ii port the wiring may be somewhat sloppy but hey its a ford who would ever know though in all fairness yes it looks like somebody was try to have fun there how can you own a car that was made since and not understand what an obd ii port is do you own a computer and not understand the difference between an executable file and otherwise do you own a horse and not understand why you have to put shoes on it every now and then do you own a house and not understand that the roof might go bad and you would have to check on it do you own a tv without having the remote for it do you have a tumble dryer and have never checked the lint trap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is definitely after market and the wires fall down which are electric taped together
whatisthisthing,not_removed,riamverysmart
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lint trap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you found the obd ii port elsewhere it could be a hack job replacing the port or something trying to cheat emissions if you found the real port id guess either for programming some add on or maybe a controller for a plow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the obd ii standard requires the connector to be located within something like feet of the driver if theres not another connector like that around its definitely your obd ii connector though it may have been replaced at some point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what happened to that cat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as for the what it looks like a bending roller for narrow strips pipes bars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,roll bender no idea of brand httpsenwikipediaorgwikirollbender
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it for sale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most definitely i am going to fix it up repaint it cat yellow but i needed to know what it was first 😀
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cabinet door slide that allows you to lift up and slide in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is still open help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is part of the foldout couch mattress frame i cant find a close up picture of a frame but you should checkout the hideaway youre sitting on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,alas i do not own nor have i ever owned a sofa bed so that cant be it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks kinda like a porsche
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe some kind of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a or a chrysler crossfire side profile is very
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ford gt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thats it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the first item is a wax seal you would melt some sealing wax smush it over an envelopes flap where it meets the back of the envelope and press the seal into the wax it seals the envelope and is also tamper resistant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably the maybe tip with all of the pearl looking stuff take the tail of your shirt or something with similar texture wipe it on one of your teeth then rub the pearl on it and if it feels gritty its real pearl if you cant really tell if its gritty take the edge of a soda can and rub it on your tooth and thats what it would feel like smooth considering the age its probably real though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks mostly mid century
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really i was confused as to exactly what it was because theres a clip on the back not a brooch or hair clip so i was at a loss i appreciate your comment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats an awesome trick man i always wanted some of those little collar clips so this is extra neat thank you so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you i was pretty sure at least some of it was but it helps to have another set of eyes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sweet thanks mate d
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not a seal seals are backwards so they print forwards this is a monogram a m l i think first name a middle name l last name m something what kind of clip sharp teeth or a hair thingy the two jaws connected by a chain are to keep a cardigan sweater draped around your shoulders
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seeing how there is a clip on the back i am wrong the wax seals ive seen have a little flat handle on them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh youre welcome i love pearls and my grandfather usually brings me jewelry finds from his stuff so it helps to know how to tell whats real bonus round silver will have on it if its made after the and smell kind of sweet if its tarnished before that look for sterling or random marks on the bottom that are squares symbols letters or stuff that looks like someone wanted to say i made this gold will usually have a number on it like or there are other numbers out there but it tells you what type of gold it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sharp teeth i was kind of hesitant about the seal thing since the font looked correct to me i can grab a photo of the back in the morning if that helps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre a treasure trove of antique information ill be sure to post more stuff from the box this week d thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a dress clip you attached the neck of your low cut dress to your bra or slip underneath to keep it from sliding or gapping dress clips often came in pairs to use with deep square necks you put one at each corner this one would go at the point of a v either that or its part of a pair of bib clips but has lost its chain and mate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like shiney stuff youre welcome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it doesnt look like it had anything attached to it so this is probably it thank you so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these are from south eastern massachusetts the red stone is catalogued as rock with hole and the hole does not go all the way through the other pieces are pottery shards that have similar drill marks on the pottery shards the holes go all the way through can anyone give me more info about these holes my first thought was pendants maybe after a vessel broke they used the shards as jewelery these are from a native american site wamponoag i think not sure of the date
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe i know this one i think it a stone used to hold a stick in place while using a bow to start a fire like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might want to cross post this to rrhodeisland
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the larger holes look like pholadid bivalve borings the others could be from any number of encrusting organisms eg many genera of porifera encrust and bore httpsenwikipediaorgwikipholadborings httpwwwoceanicresearchorgeducationwondersspongeshtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rarcheology might be worth posting to as well i only have vague experience with na arrowheads goes so no honest clue here beyond being fascinated a bit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,coal chute are there openings outside dont know why there would be though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,incinerator or old boiler used to be normal to burn your trash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are the unreadable words raised can you do a crayon rubbing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved pried one open
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im inclined to agree wit uplaidpaint i have a similar one on my single flue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i havent seen one of these but id say that its not a pulley but instead a roller like on some overhead or underfloor trolley systems this would fit into a slotted track thats as wide as the entire assembly and the slot is as wide as those two center rollers plus the space between them the green delrin or neoprene rollers are what rides on the track carrying the load hang something heavy from it and you can move it along the track with ease
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i figured it out its for an automatic car wash it goes on the track and seats behind the tire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any help on what this is greatly appreciated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you know if the green material is not metal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,almost looks like a bumperroller set up to my eyes like what is on a boat trailer for easy loading
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks about long and to wide judging from the diamond plate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is correct okay i was close heres a photo of it in use
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you thought about becoming an investigator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you got me in the right direction for sure thanks again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a reddit investigators i havent until now think of the glory the up votes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but could you tell us whats in the safe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i could i wont but i could
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you couldnt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i might
whatisthisthing,not_removed,may also be one of these old multioutlets yours is shown upsidedown httpwwwplugsocketmuseumnltapalinehtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a track power bar similar to this httpwwwplugsocketmuseumnltapalinehtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some kind of light armature maybe do you have a pic of the inside or are there contactpoints anywhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep tapaline outlet strip i have a few and still use them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a that someone wired a lamp cord to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as of right now im going to put my money on this it goes toward a spot in the room with no near by outlets and the previous owners seem like just the type to use this sort of thing great work thank you very much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no other inputs or markings hope this helps httpiimgurcomnswgmvljpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks you just made my day if everything else fails try cat and the cat said go away peasant i am eating it might be some kind of heater that you put under the blankets they were dangerous plug it in and feel if it gets warm you wont burn your hands the problem was fire by shortcircuit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have no helpful input on this one but i love your cat staring longingly at the empty bowl in frame
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from that photo im going to say its definitely a track lighting bar it doesnt have the slots needed to be an outlet strip a light fixture would go into the slot then turn degrees bringing its wings into contact with the two power rails trash unless you have matching light fixtures
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shell do this weird thing where she pretends to eat when its empty im not sure if its to get my attention but its super cute love that cat shes been fed right now 😁👍
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have a picture of the type of light im really confused on how this would work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hah if im even minutes later than usual waking up my cat will lick her bowl the window my desk as loud as possible until i get up and feed her go cats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this picture explains it somewhat httpwwwtotaltracklightingcompopulartracklightingstyleshtml the light base it t shaped you put it in the slot then turn it so the wings of the t go under the lips and make electrical contact edit of the real thing ive only ever seeninstalled the conductor versions personally
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its made to look like an old seed baghave seen potato ones and flour also for nostalgia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just a generic design based on a vintage seed packet the good earth would be the fake brand of the seeds its not a reference to the pearl s buck book they are just going for a generic knockoff old timey nostalgia look and because the earth is goodits a for businesses that want to be perceived as natural or wholesome jacquard or tapestry woven cotton throw blankets with fringe were a fad for a while in the and the old timey look was a popular motif source have been alive for decades i collect vintage seed packets and my aging relatives have gone for this old timey look in their kitchens since the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are a bunch of good earth horticultural companies it was also the name of a natural foods restaurant chain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably decor from one of the the old httpsenwikipediaorgwikigoodearthrestaurantchain edit fixed the link stupid parentheses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i read the synopsis of the book whoa its not about tomatoes at all funny how companies will use slogans from unknown sources
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is you is or is you aint my constituency
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these people are right its an old timey look kind of thing i have an afghan blanket like yours but it has model production years of old tractors on it got it an a silent auction years ago still love how cozy it feels but the old lady hates it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,depeche mode logo from one of their albums httpsenwikipediaorgwikisoundsoftheuniversemediafiledepechemodesoundsoftheuniversepng
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the solution thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont wanna sound like a queer or nothin but i think depeche mode is a sweet band
whatisthisthing,not_removed,darn the one time i knew one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if liking depeche mode makes me queer i dont want to be uhnot queer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you say that as of sounding like a queer was a bad thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the spirit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these are the organs of a small animal my outdoor cat used to bring presents like this into my bedroom as a kid or leave them on the welcome mat on the front porch the cat ate the rest and brought you this as a gift as you mentioned she hasnt been out in a few days id be doing some investigating behind your furniture she may have a stash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,funny thought recently i read an article suggesting that when cats brought you dead things they werent really presents they think the cat sees you as just a really big cat who is shit at hunting so shes really just trying to keep you fed like she would a kitten yup you always knew you cat thought you were pathetic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my friends outdoor cat used to bring him rats as presents all the time he would throw them out of the house and scold the cat the cat then began killing them outside and living the rat ramains in the back yard but bring in various organs for him as presents heart living etc might be organs to rats mice birds from your cat have you found dead rodents birds around the yard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the first time i found something similar to this was about a month ago but it was about twice the size of these two and a lot more red in color are they just weird turds they look like grubs and vary in color from brown to red
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep rodent kidneys i had a cat that everything but the kidneys too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just shared some leftover osso buco with my cat i dont think she regards me as a shit hunter tonight
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i really dont see any kind of features and they arent wet theyre not super squishy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,she hasnt been outside in the past couple days and they showed up this morning so i dont know about that hmmm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mine just leave green googly squashy bits lying around from dead animals they kill and eat well not mention live rabbits live moles how the f does a cat catch a mole whole unmarked dead pigeons live mice and live birds i have graduated from totally incompetent to able to be trained to kill in my cats minds i guess edit looking at it really closely they could be fledgling just hatched birds or very young micerodents
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be why it looks kinda dried and shriveled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my cat doesnt bring much stuff once in a while i find a grasshopper on my belly trying to get asylum but birds are rare interesting that he didnt hunt the neighbors rabbits yet or did he
whatisthisthing,not_removed,about the rabbits mine seem to bring them in live and release them for the dogs to play with i have working breed so they dont bite down just hold in the mouth one day i saw a rabbit released in the garden by one of the two cats dog picked it up let it go cat caught it and released it dog caught etc etc until i stepped in very quickly they have only ever once injured a rabbit disembowelment which i broke the neck of immediately having said that they will sit on the roof of hutches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be a milling ball in the us they were used in a large rotating bin to grind or reduce grains or other materials in to particulates i can only speculate being your item is from switzerland here is some reading good luck edit i have found several while arrowhead hunting and most were about that size or smaller made of stone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be a pebble yes thats what theyre called made in a giants kettle which is basically a hole in a rock riverbed that catches rocks rolling down the river and the current spins them around and around sometimes for years making the hole kettle bigger and the pebble almost perfectly round if there was a river nearby thats what id bet it is nearby in geography or time after a river changes its route over time the kettles and pebbles remain sometimes they exist in areas that have no river in the area but there was one historically
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe an enterolith
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,til interesting subject thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is that jan hus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its called a httpsenwikipediaorgwikikineticart kinetic art is art from any medium that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or depends on motion for its effect canvas paintings that extend the viewers perspective of the artwork and incorporate multidimensional movement are the earliest examples of kinetic art more pertinently speaking kinetic art is a term that today most often refers to threedimensional sculptures and figures such as mobiles that move naturally or are machine operated the moving parts are generally powered by wind a motor or the observer kinetic art encompasses a wide variety of overlapping techniques and styles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have seen one of these behind a lowes before too so i dont think its art like the other posters so far it was back by a service road behind trees so there would be really no reason to put a big art installation there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why does this have a solved tag when theres not a definitive answer yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as others have noted this is a kinetic sculpture urban legend around bloomington is that it was placed behind the strip mall instead of by the highway as the builder was pissed about the bloomington rule that all major new construction must devote a certain percentage to public art they spend the money on art but placed it where people wouldnt see it i have no idea if that is true
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe its to scare away birds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill guess art too i wondered if each is a different material and weight and that it helps determine wind speed but that would be so imprecise
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely art similar pieces can or at least could five years ago be found in wellington nz near the harbour
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like art to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,iirc when it was installed being lowes it was a clock of sorts but it wasnt really ever publicised
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh first time ive seen a post of something from my town its actually behind a lowes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,even though its solved i still think its a phone stand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,north carolina
whatisthisthing,not_removed,art a city was forced to buy those involved were so embarrassed they put it behind a home depot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,burning man
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey everyone this guy has a girlfriend
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup this is correct these sorts of things seem like they dont have any use and just look odd in pictures but they make a lot more sense when you see them in motion for example my college has one which is actually pretty and it moves even when theres no wind despite not being powered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be the same one i may have misidentified it as a home depot bloomington
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how many years could lowes idiots have planted trees which have grown to become enormous
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are still here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,weird its behind some trees so whoever runs that property must not care for it since you have to pull behind the home depot to get a good look at it thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would think the same but it was behind trees from the road i could barely make it out i cant imagine an art installation being newly built where the best view is from the loading dock of a home depot but you never know with all this postmodern art today edit it seems to be art what an odd placement
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinetic art you dont need the quotes they make you look like a douche
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes youre correct im from out of town and guessed a home depot without seeing the signage its a weird placement for a sculpture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,me too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey everyone this guy doesnt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that isnt a weird thing for socially adjusted adults to have the idea that its worth commenting on says more about you than me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep i actually thought it might be the same one after i commented ive always wondered what it was too but who knows there is a lot of random art here could be someone thought behind lowes was the ideal spot for beautification with strange giant spinning needle art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah those stupid treeplanters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah so it is art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the bench that had a geocache appears removed in ops photo wgirlfriend
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why would they hide art behind a shopping mall or is it facing a highway on another side i cant quite tell from the photos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe it was there before the home depot or trees
whatisthisthing,not_removed,were there picnic benches nearby maybe its for the employees if they eat lunch outdoors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,birdnerd
whatisthisthing,not_removed,douche
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you thought about what makes you look like a douche
whatisthisthing,not_removed,on the other side of the lowes i was wrong about it being a home depot there is a small road leading out of the shopping center and onto a highway which is close to the it is not visible from the freeway or the highway it is only visible from that small road and there are trees between the road and the sculpture im also curious as to why it is somewhat hidden
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah its literally right off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe the person who commissioned the artist to create the piece didnt like the finished product so they stuck it there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but the trees were planted meaning it was an intentional choice to obscure the sculpture from the road
whatisthisthing,not_removed,animals like to use closets as bathrooms hopefully its just pooppee from someones pets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youre being paranoid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,somebody really lined themselves up perfectly before they died
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most likely the result of an animal when some one dies from bleeding there is a lot of blood like more than youd expect im not saying its impossible for blood to pool only under the body but most of the time you end up with a large round puddle fun fact theres about liters of blood in your body how big of a mess would you make if you dumped a of soda on the kitchen floor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its just pareidolia if you follow the outline of the dark patches exactly it really isnt very person shaped i also dont see a head outline at least if it is a body then they had no head when they died and so probably wouldnt have felt much pain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i doubt it if a person decomposed ontop of those boards they would be much more damaged than that or at least smell so terrible that theyd have to be removed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are the boards wide enough to each fit a leg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably just a wood stain of some sort i hear bleach can get something like that up not sure never cleaned up a body stain if it was in my closet id find it fascinating im a bit morbid that way id be showing it to friends and family of course id clean it up a bit and try to get rid of the smell im not usually gross but people might like to visit your house just to see that not a joke im serious not sure why that fascinates me since i would never want anyone to hurt or die its just so strange looking and interesting its probably just an interesting stain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hardwoods blacken in contact with alkali s the stain can usually be removed with an acid oxalic is sold as teak cleaner if that was a body marking it the smell would be long gone so its more likely rot of some description
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope you are seeing things but no fault of your own our brains are incredibly good at spotting patterns and figures like faces or jesus in your piece if toast even to a fault our brains try to find patterns when no pattern actually exists that is why random settings on pandora or other sites is not random its engineered to fit what we percieve as random if it were truly random then we would not be complaining when pandora plays country songs in a row but i digress here is a link httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiapophenia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely pee stains from animals especially since there was carpet there previously we went through the same thing in our home that had carpet installed in the even tried resurfacing the floor and couldnt get the stains completely out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can sadly confirm we had a dog with a bladder problem at old age with rugs and hard wood floor when we took out those rugs the floor looked like that a cheap rug cleaner didnt get deep enough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,only litres i am really disappointed now i thought the human body was around water and i had assumed that was the water in blood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no other like it in the house and it the only spot that smells
whatisthisthing,not_removed,go on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mirror image is down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,body storage is much less creepy than some one died right there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so you thought that a persons body is blood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,adults are usually just under water the vast majority of it is trapped in cells that make up your body while blood is the most liquidy part of your body its only got a small portion of your total body water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not exactly i hadnt had any coffee yet when i posted that i know that figure cant be right but i also thought that there was more than litres in the human body there is a lot of area in the body in which oxygen needs to be delivered and needs to be taken away

whatisthisthing,not_removed,blue bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for bluebottle dang guess i wont be swimming there for a while thanks guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree what beach did you find it on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,blue bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they were washed up on the stretch of beach between the lagoon and kerford rd piers quiet a few people swimming that day too so i hop no one got hurt editit was in south melbourne australia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,blue bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes sir it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just a little soap and water should clean it up good as new
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that sir is a device to plug ones butthole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its exactly what you think it is i dont recognize that particular brand but i can tell you the hole on the end is designed to hold a bullet style mini vibe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wouldnt use it keep looking maybe they left one with a flange
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how nice of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and here i was thinking it was a pipe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there it is ive been looking for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really op really
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that sure looks worn out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you know what that is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it surely is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,except it is your wifes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,housewarming gift
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well it depends on the material a platinum level or true body safe silicone will be nonporous but a low quality product cannot be saved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just toss it in the dishwasher no need to waste water though throw it on with a full load of dishes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but does it need to be plugged in to work wheres the cord for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or a rip cord
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or you can thread a line through and use it as a plumb bob
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its actually not its for your finger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh no honey
whatisthisthing,not_removed,addendum the website says its easy to boil and is dishwasher safe so theres that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wtf is this from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the beauty of it its completely cordless and you can take it and use it anywhere at any time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a bullet vibe goes in the loop at the end there he said to answer your joking question seriously
whatisthisthing,not_removed,better grab a httpiimgurcomwfkxefcjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,picturing that caused me physical pain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to rip it out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well as long as you dont want it to actually work correctly youd have to drill a hole in it to get the line coming out centered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not on this toy cheap jelly ones that stretch a ton are for finger this one is for a bullet vibe the hole is too small long and thick walled to be intended for a finger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,elephant elephant a book of opposites
whatisthisthing,not_removed,idk how i feel about that base though seems too small to be safe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope its for your finger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,incorrect thats not what the page selling the toy saysobviously you can use it for a bullet vibe but thats not what this toy is designed for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why the hell would they not do the trunk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wonder with the hole at the bottom if it was meant to attach to something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,either way actually but in the marketing the bullet vibe angle gets played up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,link to said page
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe the trunk had to remain unplugged so the water could get in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bullet vibe goes in there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your finger goes inside there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for this specific set its designed for your finger but you could definitely use a bullet vibe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a gong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely metal of some sort its very heavy for its thickness theres some sort of asian writing on it ill try to get some close up shots for you all httpimgurcomamqqqi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its bronze looks old hope you found some treasure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not saying that it is but it looks a lot like a fragment of a chinese or japanese bronze mirror what such a thing should be doing near hartmiller island is anyones guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chinese is my second language so i may be completely wrong here but from the photo assuming that its chinese ive guessed that the two characters are either 霖豊 or 霖豐 its really a push because the first character doesnt look really accurate but my chinese app gave me it when i wrote the character i googled both options the first one 霖豊 google translate corrected me to 霖豐 so im going to presume that the second guess is the most correct i googled 霖豐 pronounced lin feng and it shows up with a taiwanese company lin feng co ltd httpwwwlimchemicalcomtwindexhtml now assuming that they make machines and stuff perhaps it came from this company while they were shipping something i dont know what exactly the thing you found is i dont really know i just kind of went off on a crappy guess on what those asian writings are this may not be helpful at all sorry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those large objects near the center look like ancient sails your best bet is have someone translate the writing on the left shown in the last pic in comments
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it could be a gong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have no clue but i wonder what the historical implications are if this turns out to be from an ancient chinese ship
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it appear to be metal ceramic wood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no clue what it is but hart miller island is killer does bull on the beach still run food from boat to boat out there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would bet its part of a logo that was mounted on a ship and was knocked off at some point based off the size of the piece the location of the inscription and the thickness of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree with a few people here it appears to be a gong if thats the case the bigger question is what ship did it come from what known wrecks are near hartmiller island if it came from something semifamous then you may have a nice chunk of change sitting in your hands
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the image looks like pharmacy stuff to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah im guessing it was a shipboard dinner gong in edwardian and victorian times dinner would be formally announced by a servant sounding the gong there was a fair amount of ceremony involved even on board ship first class guests would be expected to have changed into formal evening attire for dinner heres an actual antique dinner gong being played why a gong well it stared off as a dinner bell but anything oriental was a big fad of the day the opening of japan including the meiji restoration and increased trade with china and india gave rich victorians access to many exotic things trendy upperclass households had fine china from china oriental rugs japanese lacquered furniture and of course gongs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe you can get rtranslation to decrypt the chinese symbols
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that second pictures characters look something like those of chestnut and prosperity respectively 栗 豊
whatisthisthing,not_removed,me too definitely seems old to me but i dont know much about this kind of thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like brass plated steel to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably an inscription of a chinese junk ship httpimgurcomadmudrp

whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the mka an american muslim youth organization httpswwwmkausaorgaboutuswhoweare they had the jackets made up this summer according to this tweet so its a branded item that probably got into your order by mistake shrug tell your rep in case they want to swap it out for a plain one

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a muslimyyouth symbol proof

whatisthisthing,not_removed,rdarksouls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a second hand store or something they probably didnt order anything from north face this probably just came in with a bunch of other stuff that wasnt exactly clear from the original post though so im really not sure why your comment is so controversial
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why was this downvoted its true
whatisthisthing,not_removed,birmingham go blazers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,see rule i and ii
whatisthisthing,not_removed,totally makes sense then that context helps inform the discussion braces for more downvotes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a respectable group they help young americans and soon to be american muslims with spirituality and they appreciate their adoptive country
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have a link to a website

whatisthisthing,not_removed,comments that arent actually guesses are hitormiss here on one end why didnt you ask your grandma is pretty unhelpful on the other side asking op for clarifications is almost always good id say the parent comment was somewhere in the middle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op works for a second hand store so probably doesnt have a manufacturer rep
whatisthisthing,not_removed,worked in the specialty sports industry for long enough to know that its true and there was no negativity but good old reddit proves itself as usual
whatisthisthing,not_removed,golf claps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i seem to recall there was a rule at one point that said something like dont downvote wellintentioned responses even if wrong penalizing incorrect but wellmeaning responses is just going to make people leave
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for long enough to know that its true lol except for in this case which it isnt

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the first time ive ever seen a gilding on negative karma post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know it was a joke but honestly i really would prefer not to see discussion of these findings sometimes it just gets depressing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats not in the sidebar but actually in the onhover text for the downvote button
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol top post solved even states discussing it with their rep theyre right but im not lol follow the timestamp train lol given the provided information at the time it was and still is true every north face retailer has a dedicated sales rep for the territory at minimum who is responsible for all orders and retailer concerns lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think umarklein might have been joking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in two years how
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a lot of people myself included have resbrowser to default to css turned off which disables a lot of the individualized subreddit visuals my personal reason is because a number of them do silly things like conflict with my nightmodedark theme or disable downvote button which is like wtf go back to facebook if all you want is upvotes not to mention a e s t h e t i c s
whatisthisthing,not_removed,every north face retailer hes not a north face retailer he works at a thrift store but sure you are right even though you arent whatever makes you feel better lets all pretend uzuology got the answer right so his feelings arent hurt i mean with his strong and distinguished background in specialty sports industry he was born to get this question right and those of us who have never worked in specialty sports industry are not equipped to answer this even though we got it right and uzuology got it wrong but shhhhh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sadly there is no tone in the vast emptiness of cyberspace its the nature of written word to be interpreted and filtered by the individual reader i believe the universal notation of s should be applied to prevent this kind of misunderstanding if that is the case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more like i had another account that i lost the pw to and just made a new one i mean i figured it was possible i just havent seen one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just gotta say it one more time so your high horse has something to eat the information that it was a secondary retailer aka not a north face retailer was submitted well after the fact check your stamps be more informed and your selfrighteousness will be that much stronger lol just found this gem uliedel from my years of aquarium experience
whatisthisthing,not_removed,umarkleins comment is obviously a joke i find it sad that at least people couldnt see that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rnegativewithgold

whatisthisthing,not_removed,im gonna try to get that on video thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you simulate that with a uv lamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol i learned to never trust advice with a at the end
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its very yummy too try nibbling some of it raw and wait for that mushroomy taste to kick in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its easy to do get maybe a foot away make sure the background is slightly darker than the spores start your camera and blow on the inside of the cup steadily for maybe seconds itll take a second or two and if it hasnt already heavily sporulated then smoke like wisps should come out of the inside of the cup httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcxgahuaxmu the inside of the cup is called the hymenium and is covered in microscopic tubes called asci inside the asci spores are held in by a tiny doors when you blow onto the hymenium the doors to the asci burst open and the turgor pressure in the asci forces the spores outward sometimes making a slight hiss
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i tried that didnt seem to work though

whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you post this a couple weeks ago when i google the part number i get a bunch of links i have visited and i remember those links because some were car parts that were completely unrelated like a mercedes blower motor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks again for the advice i am going to try some local body shops if they agree on the part i will mark this as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,go visit rjustrolledintotheshop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure looks like it there are extra tabs on the unit i have maybe a different model year i tried a local jeep dealership and they have not gotten back to me do you have any sense of how to color match it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i did try to post it but i could never get the post to work had help from my daughter to get it online i also tried the number and came up with nada thanks for taking the time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he tried times but could never get the pictures linked congrats op
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so does that trim piece often match the main color of the car that is the first question it could be a thing that contrasts if you take it to a body repair shop they will be able to match it to a jeep paint code you may be able to do it yourself by just looking online at the available jeep colors from that time and model

whatisthisthing,not_removed,you answered your own question to add this was used primarily by paratroopers to signal to others who landed near them to squad up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this confuses me a bit about its origins and when it was originally introduced because it belonged to my greatuncle who received one at the start of the italian campaign which started in also the original cricket is with my cousins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahh that makes sense now thanks for the answer solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he may have recieved one but certainly not this one history of the clicker aka the cricket by harold ratzburg back in the the clicker was designed and produced as a handy pocket sized signal device which band and orchestra leaders used to keep time for their players and according to the records of the acme company who made the crickets most of them were shipped to band leaders in the usa the original cricket noise maker was a childs toy made by the acme whistle company in england they werent used only on dday but they were famously used on dday the one in the picture is a commemorative one that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i realized my cousins have the original he gave this one to me when i was young and he was visiting ill see if i can get him to send me pictures of the original

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we have a few in ct i read this article a couple years back and visited the largest in the state it gives some insight about them in our area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,metasequoias are not native to north america they are from china but are planted here as ornamental trees they are quite beautiful look like a weeping redwood but they turn brown in the winter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,welcome to the jet age stuff moves around a lot more than it used to especially if kids are involved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre a pretty popular ornamental tree we had one in our backyard that was about ft tall theyre actually endangered in china
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also curious lived here for years and have never seen one of those
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it seems very familiar and im australian
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its cute
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats fascinating thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh i can understand i was just scratching my head wondering if there were unknown stands in ri i have seen a sequoia in southern england planted obviously but doing well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would love to have one alas where i live it gets far too cold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we have a few here in western mass in the pioneer valley planted of course but it isnt surprising to see them in arboretums or universities nowadays
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres an interesting very tall very triangular shaped tree near the right side of the highway going northbound on near the mineral springs exit now im wondering if its one of these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uri has a pretty wide variety of ornamental trees and shrubs planted in various areas on campus there are a few classes that use them to study idenfication
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was that lens in the left of the photo in front of it if so its definitely not a camera it looks like a motion sensor to me

whatisthisthing,not_removed,whoa never would have guessed that thanks uevilmike it makes sense to me now i found them in the basement of an abandoned lab facility
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i literally just learned what these are at my work yesterday
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im literally sitting in lab right now as my students use these to take potato cores for their osmosis experiments
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is more suited for ranswers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a japanese pop bottle theres usually a marble under the top that you have to punch down into the bottle to open thats why the middle is pinched like that it keeps the marble from falling into the bottom although ive never seen one with a glass top all the ones ive seen have had plastic tops may just be an older bottle

whatisthisthing,not_removed,a video of a modern codd bottle and some history theyre really cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hot damn i actually bought a clear version of one of these in florida that was supposedly recovered from a ship wreak its covered in shells and other former sea life i had always wondered what it was mine has the brand g cumberland kendall on the side of it that i would like to know more about but this definitely answers the what is it question
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the input any suggestions on where i can research manufacturer origin or age
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,quarter for scale noted its size suggests it could be a perfume bottle rather than a pop bottle the head resembles a tiki statue from hi or the heads of the statues on easter island
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and to answer the second question wan is the japanese word for the sound a dog makes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here have an up vote for calling it pop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a rather standard ramune bottle size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i say both are fair game considering both soda and pop come from the same word soda pop i never got why people argue about which word to use except for texans they refer to all pop as coke buncha weirdos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here have an up vote for saying that which currently brings your comment to points
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not just texas much of the south esp georgia nothing wrong w soda pop is just superior
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in new england its tonic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,depends on what part soda or tonic sub or grinder coke or moxie take your pick lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is called a httpsenwikipediaorgwikikapala
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks like it thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup absolutely correct i have one sitting on my shelf
whatisthisthing,not_removed,based on the lowvoltage wiring it appears to be some kind of thermostat if you already have a thermostat for a heater this may be for another system like ceiling fans or something for that it would control the fans via thermostat not a speed controller edit this one from cadet looks fairly similar not saying its that one but just showing this is a common design and look for thermostats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you in the netherlands because here it is a lights dimmer probably v and between and whats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id say this is a dimmer its poorly installed with the wires showing but it sure looks like regular european wires for standard high voltage ac network httpwwwklusbeternlapokalypsiswpcontentuploadsgestripteadersjpg the dimmer are you in the eu where does the wire lead to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have a humidifier installed in your air conditioning system my whole house humidifier control looks a bit similar to that but without the wire down the wall its inside the wall
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the little slots on the corners are to let air into the unit thermostat most likely with the rotating dial turning up and down clockwise and counterclockwise respectively or it could be humidity it measures and adjusts in desert areas to add humidity anywhere else to lower it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thermostat for in floor heating
whatisthisthing,not_removed,couldnt this be a light dimmer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you checked the roof for christmas lights
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should turn it into a new house
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there any possibility this could be for ceilheat anyone familiar with ceilheat those conductors are undersized for high voltage such as a lighting circuit it could also be a thermostat control for a baseboard heater as i see the wiring running down but it could very easily be abandoned i am interested in finding the conclusion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dumb question but have you tried pushing it i would bet like others have said that it is a dimmer switch push the button for onoff and rotate for dimming
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep looks just like the thermostat for baseboard heat in my old house
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you tried tracing the wire to its source it looks like it goes somewhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah definitely looks like a potentiometer for a radiant heater
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree that its probably a thermostat but the wiring looks like ordinary uk mains flex to me so it might well be live at volts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am indeed in the netherlands but i cant test if its a lights dimmer until next weekend because there is no light in this room yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hah i think it is indeed the dimmer i am in the netherlands but i cannot test whether it is really a dimmer because i have not installed lights in this room yet will get one next weekend awesome finding
whatisthisthing,not_removed,likely solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this i had one of these at my old house just a vented box with a dial
whatisthisthing,not_removed,slots could be to let air in and heat out dimmers dissipate quite a bit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not with that wiring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this reminds me of the episode of friends where monica tries to figure out the light switch haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,turns out it was never plugged in at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i admit i have only taken apart a few thermostats but analog ones ive seen have all been a bimetal strip with a mercury switch and the knob just physically changes the tension on a spring no potentiometer involved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,u and ur fancy words
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm could be it looked like thin multicolored low voltage wire but taking another look now im not so sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the cables use the usual greenyellow brown or black and blue so it could very well be a light instead of a thermostat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,married with children had one too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe it is a form of pollen but i am not completely sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hard to tell but my first thought is dandelion seeds although ive never seen it get inside a window like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its from the ants they are likely in the wall pulling out insulation for a place to nest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an eye patch get it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is someone trying to do black magic on you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it reminds me of the parody church of the subgenius iconography specifically this seems to be a version of the eye of connie dobbs i tried to find another picture of some of seen in the past but not having luck the pattern or overall outline like this is like the usual christian fish symbols for cars real and parody versions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,legend of zelda ocarina of time is what comes to mind the eye of truth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it reminds of a series of unfortunate events there is an upcoming asoue show and maybe this is the first small step of some kind of publicity stunt that will soon lead to something bigger did you notice if these patches were left on any other cars near yours
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be an expression of santeria it might bring good will onto someones family to leave a symbol on someone elses doorstep or car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinda reminds me of a series of unfortunate events eye
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like something from yugioh to me if its not this is just plain super creepy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nice exact match
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep thats the sub genius eye symbol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from my limited medical knowledge it is called a butterfly needle and is often used in drawing blood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i asked a doctor and he says you could use it to inject drugs he says normal needles are smaller and easier to go in however maybe this butterfly is easier to self administer because you put one end in first and then can mess around with solution in a needle less syringe but it still doesnt make a lot of sense its weird
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is correct i hate those things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i thought is was strange to find a couple of them shattered around at the bottom of a stairwell with a bunch of beer cans there where also a couple different sizes of syringe there with no tips on them as if they attached separately not sure if drawing blood and drinking miller is some guys idea of a goof time or what but i cant seem to come up with any use for these needles online other than phlebotomy unless anyone else has any ideas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with a regular syringe the needle is attached to the syringe and if the syringe wiggles around so does the needle having the needle on a flexible tube may make it easier to maneuver and less likely to snag on something and wiggle around when you dont want it to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks ah well i guess you can mark this one solved now ive gotta keep a close eye on this house lest it be liberated of all its copper pipe and wiring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they can be used to administer multiple doses of drugs through one injection site wear it under a sleeve and inject for a couple of days without having to find a good vein again iv users get collapsed veins after using for a long time it makes injecting hard because they cant find a good vein to put the needle these things are a larger needle but it can be worn for a while and that makes getting the next dose in easier over time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre used for any sort of intravenous access they offer much more finesse than a needle on the end of a large syringe would normally grant allowing use with smaller veins you can stick once and provide multiple injections by swapping syringes onto the tubing they are more tolerant of patient movement basically butterfly needles can be used in just about any case where a regular needle could be used but they offer several advantages in certain situations
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah that makes sense these are more expensive than normal needles but maybe its stolen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what they used for sealing the bottles it wasnt expensive and it sorta worked
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the cork was a complete filled in circle when i was a kid we used to pull the cork out put the metal part on the outside of our tshirt and press the cork into the cap from the inside of the shirt we then had really cool decorated tshirts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most metal bottle caps nowadays have a little flexible plastic gasket instead of cork there needs to be something flexible between the metal and glass to form a tight seal plastic caps are themselves flexible enough to not need them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool vintage caps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,take a bite to eat at
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a growler to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a modern apple juice or vinegar bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am no bottle expert but i doesnt look that old probably just a growler from the microbrewery craze of the early what does the bottom look like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there a mark on the base
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you are in the uk i bet it is a scrumpy bottle stuff like old rosie comes in identical litre bottles for a fiver in most supermarkets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely not that old the screw on cap grooves are a dead give away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lots of maples around you any holes in the trees if not its probably just a beer growler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a bottle of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a small demijohn i imagine for a small batch of homebrew
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would be a bomber at that size i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,microbrewery craze of the early early that was barely the beginning craft breweries are taking off today more than ever
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most beer growlers were brownglass because light messes with beer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry trying to make a joke and have it sound like antiques roadshow i am sick brain function at
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was in asheville a little while ago and there were like breweries on one street and tons more throughout the city its crazy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just heard about growlers for the first time this year
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most but not all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,feel better soon uotiswrath
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aww thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the bucket is probably insulated are the walls thick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i want to say its a milk pail but google isnt backing me up on that any dairy folks or countrychic lovers who can weigh in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are literally hundreds of pictures of miners carrying similar looking containers to work with them would say its a lunch bucket miners worked very long shifts most hours daily whether coal gold silver etc they had to pack large meals and usually dry socks or extra handkerchiefs used for air filters in any mine it is hot and very humid needing a good container to keep things dry and usable hope it helps google some pics and see what you think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like it might be a large tiffin box httpsenwikipediaorgwikitiffincarrier
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a cooler too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes it seems to be insulated walls are very thick im not sure how to upload more pics or i would post what the inside looks like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you are correct i almost found one identical to mine are actually supposed to be other containers psycho on the inside thanks so much for helping me identify this item i found it at the goodwill yesterday and had to have it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks so much for the info i will check out the images now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks so much for the info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like httpswwwgooglecomsearchqbraceletplierstbmisch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the set screw controls how much you can close the pliers i think i picked these up at the dump years ago never have figured out what they were for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look like use the screw to set the pinch dependending on how big your hogs are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the correct answer although ive heard them called running pliers because they make the break run along the scribe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,flat jawsglasier pliers if they have an inner channel running front to back on the inside of the jawsthen definitely hog ring pliers of sorts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the coins embedded look to be chinese feng shui or lucky coins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i honestly have no idea what they are i was thinking they could be some type of appetizer plate but they seem like an odd material for that got me interested enough to pick them up for dollars as you and see in the picture they are pretty discolored and rusty if anyone knows how they clean them up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for size comparison the gold circles in the middle are roughly the size of a nickle or a quarter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i suspect they are intended for keys coins and the like i am not sure about putting food in them especially something wet or acidic generally items that are not food safe are labelled such at the original store but that disclaimer may have been lost between there and savers its had to tell from a photo but are they lacquered maybe identify the type of metal if you can before using for food its possible they are gift items not a culinary set
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh very cool that looks like it might be it they do appear to be cast iron any idea how old they might be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looking at some pictures you are absolutely right that solves half of it now just want to know what the plates are p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen these used at an asian fusion restaurant they brought out the check on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont clean them with anything but warm water and mild soap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or dont clean them at all and have them welded to make a nice fountain piece
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a pupa maybe a moth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a quick search gives me a noctuid moth httpwwwdowngardenservicesorgukmothhtm check the picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,triffid larva
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought hawk moth of some description
whatisthisthing,not_removed,leatherjacket daddy longlegs pupa they can cause damage to young plant roots and lawns i usually just dig them out and throw them on the grass for the birds to eat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the innards of a sliding switch mechanism
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpimgurcomaagtcn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,underneath the front passenger seat maybe a plug thats supposed to be connected to the seat for heating can you pull it out a little you should probably use a voltmeter to check if it has power possibly only when the ignition is on or when the seat heating is turned up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or it could have been used for connecting an amplifier or a subwoofer by the previous owner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no power seats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no heated seats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doubtful sound has not been a priority in this vehicle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikipodophyllum are ground plants not trees so you can rule that one out cutting the fruit in half would help in determining what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you know what the fruit looks like on the inside maybe osage orange but probably not try crossposting to rwhatsthisplant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pawpaw leaves stink osage orange trees have thorns hope this helps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,google reverse image search has revealed to me that this is in fact a plant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a citrus leaf take a leaf from the plant and roll it in your hand what does it smell like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do the fruits turn orange in fall looks like a persimmon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eliarch no doubt on the flowering quince fruit is immature at the moment but it will turn golden yellow in late fall it will remain tart hard and sometimes astringent but the ripe fruit will have a very floral smell the bush and this looks to be a large one will have thorns dissection of the fruit will probably be misleading as the seeds inside resemble an apple but with a more woody core edit to say the flowering end of the fruit is typically distinct from apple and pear developing an appearance similar to an outside belly button solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive suggested this still waiting for reply
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not exactly new to reddit so i should have figured this would be a sub but i didnt know about it going there now thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,osage orange was my first thought believe it or not ive seen these a few times in wv
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im always amazed at the amount of active subreddits about the strangest stuff and with confusing names like rmarijuanaenthusiasts about trees and rtrees about marijuana its hard to find a good active subreddit update us if you find out what is is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,anyone know of a commercial source of osage orange seeds or plants thx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,osage orange are very bumpy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this example is truly precious lol i will be sure to reveal whatever i find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen osage oranges at whole foods not to be eaten thoughthey are reputed to be a natural insect repellent
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,def a crossbow i made one in wood shop in same exact kit i bought it originally came with a spool that would mount to the front for fishing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,toy it looks machined so therefore cant be that old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not old not a toy perse a childs cross bow or a cheap low end one maybe a home project kinda neat but doubt its seen any serious use or was designed for it in the first place but yeah basically a toy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,toy the limbs couldnt store enough energy to bring down an animal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwfirstnaturecomfungicaloceraviscosaphp this is a saprobe while ramaria are mycorrhizal form associations with trees like truffles will
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rmycology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive no idea but i know theres an irish mycology group on facebook theyd likely be able to help if you havent tried that already
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill be sure to go there first next time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its one of the best sub reddits i know of the different species of mushroomfungus is amazing and if they dont know over there then no one will
whatisthisthing,not_removed,deer stands for hunting deer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeeeahthats the type of stand people fall out of that thing looks ridiculously unsafe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,deer hunting stands have two uses first it takes the hunters scent off the ground deer have very good noses second deer tend to look for threats at ground level hunting stands are particularly useful during bow season when you have to be much closer than during rifle season this one is a bit odd for not having a platform to sit on though and it is pretty fancy and heavy otherwise
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow there must be a lot of deers here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,third if you are raised from the ground your shot will likely be safer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i bet the hunter sits on the platform facing away from the tree with his feet on the next step down and the top part is just a safety bar to keep from falling backwards when turning around possibly to steady the gun when shooting or maybe the hunter brings a camp seat along to sit on the platform
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at least there was at some point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,true thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there a platform it wasnt clear to me but the face the other way idea makes sense particularly if there is a deer run on the other side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikienlarger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had one of these its russian i sold it on ebay for a tenner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how does it work is it just a magnifying glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats it thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it works like a slide projector but projects straight down on to the base you put a piece of photo paper on the base then project the film onto it for a few seconds then develop the paper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,magnifying glasses use reflections passed through lenses this on the other hand is the same principle that when you stand close to a light source your shadow is larger but with transparent film the whole thing is larger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perhaps for firewood delivery its in an alley behind brownstone buildings downtown boston
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chicken coupe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i bet there is a water shutoff or something in there or used to be something utility related
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it tall enough to be bicycle storage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a coop would have water food a sheltered area from sun and rain and a spot to nest this is not a coop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an egg topper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op did someone try sticking their thumb in it i see that bandaid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for the closure that was pretty much what was thought but veterinary uses were also being bounced around how do i mark this as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn i posted the wrong picture i meant to hide that from the world
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a vitamin pill vitamin e fish oil etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fish oil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its your friend ask
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a vitamin supplement
whatisthisthing,not_removed,either omega oil or lecithin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fish oil pill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like candy specifically a mike and ike
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im no expert but im pretty sure illicit drugs dont come in gel cap form assuming thats what youre checking against
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dayquil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be a karvol capsule
whatisthisthing,not_removed,candy or a supplement i would just ask your friend i mean whats the worst that can happen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like e to me vitamin e not ecstasy but it could be fishoil as others have suggested those types of pill look the same
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a pill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed i dont think its anything shady the omega oil i take looks exactly like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this sub needs a tag for this also if you clearly have access to a person who knows but refuse to use said access it should be tagged as such somehow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,acid does sometimes but then its the simple twopiece caps and they appear to have nothing inside them ops find is probably just fish oil and anyway if it were lsd i wouldnt worry about that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a sluice for flushing out bedpans
whatisthisthing,not_removed,had a foot pedal that would open and close it similar to a trash can the arms would fold up inside of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so the next question is based on the fact that virtually no one knows what these are anymore how are bedpans cleaned now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why are there so many abandoned asylums in connecticut
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i used to be a medical equipment repair technician unfortunately i had an old age home that had bed pan washers under contract from my employer in my territory i would have to verify correct function and make sure they ran at the correct temperature and long enough per cycle and repair if needed i wore full biohazard gear whenever i went in there im sure it freaked out the residence when they saw me coming down the hall in a full head to toe bunny suit but im sure as hell not going to get c dif from some old people dook
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where abouts in ct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,carefully actually they are emptied into the commode and rinsed out with an attached spray arm apparatus connected to the toilet have to do it carefully tho the splash back can be awful another reason everybody wears scrubs these days white uniforms were such an impractical choice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fairfield hills i know there are a few buildings still standing there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more photos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was this at norwich state or somewhere else
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you have many pictures from there rabandonedporn would like to speak with you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they were in every hospital room when i worked on the floors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my brother has been in a out of the hospital the last few months for chemo every one of the toilets in the patients rooms has what looks like a shower head on a swinging arm on the back of the toilet when you swing it down so it is pointed into the toilet and flush it sprays so you put some water in the bedpan dump it into the toilet and keep rinsing it till clean at least thats how they do it at my brothers hospital and the one our mom works at one thing i found interesting is when he had to go to the icu because his hickman port got infected and he went septic they had a small cabinet with a sink and what looked like a very small padded bench attached to it if you lifted up the bench it would fall trough some hidden swinging doors and under it is the toilet which is really awkward cause you have like zero privacy in a icu room
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bedpans we use mostly nowadays are cardboard and get thrown in a macerator plastic ones get washed in a big dishwasher
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i havent read all the responses but the top response showed what is actually used to clean commodes for patients who can get out of bed but not very far bed pans now a days are disposable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,disposable and it all goes straight to the trash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is a douchette shower head that they use to wash them out and flush the contents dpwn the toilet my wife works in a hospital and deals with this exact thing on a daily basis
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bed pans are disposable now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the nurses and techs usually rinse them out in a hopper that can also flush things down and away im a nurse and clean quite a few bedpans
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say theyre rinsed but not cleaned and then thrown away after discharge as they are plastic these days
whatisthisthing,not_removed,based on my experience as a psw bedpans are have been replaced by adult diapers nurses dont like bedpans so if they can put you in a diaper they will
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at one point it was the cure for a lot of things we can now treat with medication and therapy some of the old kirkbride plan asylums were shut down in the wake of the public finding out about the horrible and abusive conditions a lot of patients endured in the few that were mismanaged and abusive though most were closed with the advent of group homes and supported living arrangements for those who suffer from mental disorders on top of that the point where deinstitutionalization started was a point where antipsychotics were in widespread use there were also some social security amendments that lowered the amount of money the government was spending on locking people up as opposed to putting them into community treatment plans
whatisthisthing,not_removed,alot of crazy ass white folks with money not long ago if you were gay lazy an intelligent woman or just an embarrassment to your family they would sometimes say you were insane and send you to one of these places if you werent crazy when you got there you learned how real quick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there were many more asylums everywhere in the country before the advent of antipsychotic drugs other psychiatric medications and ect without medical treatments there was little that could be done form many people with mental illness except put them some place where people would make sure they were fed and cleaned and didnt hurt themselves or others they were really just holding facilities more than treatment centers because there was little that could be done for many of them with advanced psychiatric medicine the mental wards and asylums emptied out and most became redundant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im wondering if its norwich state
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be fairfield hills in newtown
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the mansfield training school to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good to know nurses wear colors to hide the coating of fecal matter and urine that theyre walking around with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah but i dont know if you could even bust in they keep them locked up pretty tight
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone else asked that and op confirmed how the hell does everyone know exactly where this is based off of this picture maybe its a ct thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is norwich state
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the site you linked is hijackedinfected w virus according to avast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think i like the looks of the old ones fully enclosed handsfree no backsplashing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are being phased out quickly as they are an infection control nightmare the sprayer spreads feces from the bed pan allll over the environment in a nice airborne spray any decent facility should have centralized sterilization or anroom sterilizer such as the ninjo like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so thats what that bar thing is forcleaning bedpans been wondering about those things for a long time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh thats what the sprayer is for we had a toilet like that in our callroom in the hospital and i couldnt figure out what it would spray wasnt facing the right way to be a bidet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,omg i wondered what that was for when i was in the hospital
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for this i was wondering about it for a while i was in a nursing home several months ago and saw this in one of the bathrooms i forgot to take a picture and then forgot about it until now mystery solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,omg my fiancé had neck surgery weeks ago and his room had one of these and we were mind boggled trying to figure out what the heck that shower head was on the toilet thank you for answering a pestering question i forgot i had
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i work in the icu and just trash them after each poop unless its extremely frequent
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen those too but they at least had a privacy curtain you could pull in front of you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ewwwgross almost reminds me of when i used to be a busboy at bill knapps the guys in the back used to wash the floor mats in the same dishwasher that the platessilverware went through
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not entirely sure its related to the time frame you wrote about but nellie bly was a pioneer in investigative journalism that let the public see what asylums were like i did a report on her on the fifth grade she was awesome httpsenmwikipediaorgwikinelliebly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i took a tour of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikitraversecitystatehospital a couple of years back the parts that havent been modernized yet have been vandalized but you could still see that the place was absolutely beautiful in its time the tour guide told us that pretty much the entire city used to belong to the hospital and it had a full farm generator etc and was pretty much self sufficient he pinned the collapse of the hospital partly on the government declaring that since the patients all worked the farm they all needed to be paid at least minimum wage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ehhh it happened but its much more that these liberal new england states gave a lot more public funding to treating mental illness and had much more time to build infrastructure to the point where youre building mental hospitals and then that funding all went out the window around the time reagan came around
whatisthisthing,not_removed,medical transporter here it still happens nowadays thankfully it isnt too common and the places i bring people to are more like specialized nursing homes or clinics rather than asylums
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you got it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been in about half a dozen different buildings on that campus and it doesnt look like anything i saw then again the place is gigantic and different buildings were built all over the span of like years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think they knocked that place down i went to foxwoods and we drove to mohegan sun and the old hospital was gone isnt it route or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is one in waterford too on the coast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i never understood why so many wear their scrubs while commuting on the train they get to the hospital wash their hands wear gloves but during surgery youre still getting mrsa and whatever was on the train
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i did once when i was younger found a broken window in a door and squeezed through it was only able to get into one floor though as everything else was locked or welded shut and i didnt want to cause any damage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a ct thing source connecticutian
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you dont want to click link heres a screenshot of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the old ones look like theyd be interesting to use yeah those spray arms can get out of control sometimes i learned never to stand too close when rinsing a bedpan and never do it while breathing through an open mouth my aversion to smells would cause me to automatically breathe through my mouth while doing the deed until i realized my aversion to having pee splash land on my open lips was much stronger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,call room mustve once been a patient room i suppose i guess you could use it to clean plates off then probably not a good idea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the icu room more of an alcove had a curtain too but a nurse could walk in at any time and they are just outside the room and my brother had some cute nurses i would rather just die than serenade them with the song of my poophole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those industrial dishwashers run so hot all life dies within if theyre setup right that is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the only thing that gets waashed in it is bedpans and piss bottles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,she started the ball rolling definitely there was another journalist who smuggled a camera into an asylum i think that ended up getting some pretty horrifying footage of the inside too i cant seem to find the video i was thinking of but there was the expose from on the conditions at pennhurst asylum in pennsylvania
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is that who the main character in american horror storyasylum is based on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah they demolished it the main building at least
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im a first year student ill bear that in mind for the future and have a change of clothes for the trip there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have photos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i couldnt do your job i commend you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmmever consider wearing a splash shield
whatisthisthing,not_removed,facemask smeared with vicks man saved me from vomiting countless times
whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha nurses have heard and seen it all though i understand though i hope i never have to poop in one of those
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not just hot but the rinse formula is iodine the same type of stuff used in a triple sink so no germs survive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might be thinking of geraldo riveras investigative reports on willowbrook state school in which he has httpwwwgeraldocompagewillowbrook
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought so someone told me the saved bricks are going to savanna georgia to be used for the streets pretty neat if true
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i couldnt take that anymore either got out of dodge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i havent emptied a bedpan in years so its a moot point i wear protective gear nowit wasnt readily available where i worked emptying the pans
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just because we have seen it all doesnt mean we want to see it all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont blame you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what size are they parts of jewelry christmas ornaments things to hang on the bottom of hanging planters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for me it looks like some kind of instrument
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe something that acts as a weighthandle on some sort of curtainrope i find it funny that you bought it for £ without knowing what it is hehe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im dying to know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bell clappers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a decorative version of a flail or morningstar to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,morris dancers beware of flying flails solved👀
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are inches long and with their weight would probably bring the xmas tree toppling down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no they are ornamental in there way like nunchucks they measure in length
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are ornamentally ceremonial and measure in length inches i actually liked them but really bought them for eventually selling them on ebay if i only knew what their name was anyway for quid they were a bargain one could hang them on a wall they would look very decorous
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ha ha i love that description and thanks but try as i might i cannot see wooden bell clappers they are more along the lines of weapons like nunchucks but they are separate items and definitely ornamental thanks anyway you raised a chuckle from me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i do believe you are right i went to your link and i now see that my objects are indeed morningstar flails albeit without the spikes mine are more of a decorous nature and not intended to beat the wife with tongue in cheek i am indeed indebted to you madamsir i will now be able to describe them if i ever put them on ebay though strangely now that you have solved my problem of being in the dark about their purpose i fancy putting them on my wall just in case i ever come face to face with a burglar in my flat i will be able to flail himher with one in each hand lol once again i thank you🙏👍 yes it does look like a morris dancers might use these to bang his troupe into line🙀
whatisthisthing,not_removed,glad i could brighten your day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre welcome it occurred to me they might be props for something like morris dancing does that fit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,appears to be a bait bottle used to track down pharmacy thieves
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just got back from taking it down to the cop shop seems i found evidence for a pending case against a local teacher who is implicated in pharmacy robberies around here seems she lives right in the area where i found it they seemed quite happy that i brought it in today im a hero
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there was also some cotton batting and the mostly powdered remains of some light blue tablets inside is this a gps tracking device notice that there is no prescription on the bottle seems awfully large for a modern tracking device doesnt it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have better detail of that bar code or the numbers and such around it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe the bottle was just a simple and convenient waterproof container can you get better pictures of the components on the circuit boards
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow thanks for posting this is the coolest thing ive ever seen in this sub
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks kinda like the internals for a mifi cellular modem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like stripped down digital scales
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you take a better pic of the electronics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fun fact some car lots install these in the cars they sell in order to help locate them in the event of a repossession i think the interesting thing here is that the former teacher robbed a pharmacy left and had enough forethought to check the bottles for a tracker she then appears to have disconnected it and left it where it was found
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well i dont think theres anything wrong with using homeopathic remedies but if you choose to go that route a person should try to find sufficient and peer reviewed evidence that the treatment works probably consult a doctor as well but in the case of avoiding opioids in some instances chiropractic care is a good place to look
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i suspect youre probably right although i just thought it was way to big for a modern tracking device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it seems really dumb that they would announce this all you have to do is say pour all the pills in the bag and they can organize them later based on their codes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i totally thought they were going to notice it moved and take you down with a swat team lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow what a story to come out of this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow i thought it was just a hilarious geocache
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is amazing you helped stop a criminal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they seemed quite happy that i brought it in the teacher disagrees
whatisthisthing,not_removed,buy a suit you are going to court
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well congratulations youre a braver man than i taking something like that to the cops is as likely as not to find yourself being accused of stealing it and possibly having your belongings rifled through and your shit damaged without any repayment for said damage and not even so much so as a sorry id have put that bottle right back where i found it and if they were lucky the cops might get an anonymous tip on its location via email from a library computer the cops are never your friends even when you know youre innocent
whatisthisthing,not_removed,marc wait i dont think thats the right word
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i knew what it was as soon as i read the title because i just saw the story about the teacher a few days ago crazy that its the very same bottle they caught her minutes from where i live
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems to be good you seem to be satisfied
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why would they tell you all that about the case if it is still open
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wait if this is a bait bottle why couldnt the cops track it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unless youre the type who believes in treatment over incarceration then youre less of a hero
whatisthisthing,not_removed,teacher ww
whatisthisthing,not_removed,way to throw them off your trail
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a hero that tells the internet sensitive information possibly hurting the investigation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good for you i would be terrified
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im amazed they come in thats nuts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if possible contact the police even if the thiefs finger prints are gone the police may get some info from you or the drop site thatll be helpful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or wrap in foil and check later
whatisthisthing,not_removed,great question i dont know why i didnt think to look there no need to read the barcode it says the barcode itself seems to be a serial number
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it also contained pills not sure if they are really oxy or just sugar pills though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be but wasnt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,found ahmed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the battery and the unit itself along with a sizable ball of cotton and a few pretty much deteriorated pills of unknown quantity all fit quite comfortably in that unit bottle i pulled them out with a neelenose pliers no big deal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what made you think its pcie do you think all integrated circuits are pcie
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i posted somewhere in this thread the information about the gps tracker chip searching for barcode should get you there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,smalleffectiveexpensive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting im still interested in a better look at the electronics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the gps receivers i use in my trackers are about the volume of a sugar cube and theyre not the latest generation thats not the bulky part you need a transmitter to send the data anywhere and you need power for the gps and the transmitter the laws of physics set some constraints on those also if you just need it to fit in a pill bottle theres not much sense spending more money on miniaturization or sacrificing battery life to make it any smaller than necessary
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they make the trackers the right size to approximate the weight feel of a full bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,plug the batteries back in and find out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,batteries are big
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre robbing a pharmacy you have to assume you tripped a silent alarm when you broke in police response averages less than minutes if you dont have to worry about tracking devices you can sweep every bottle off every shelf in the narcotics cabinet in a couple seconds you might get bottles of various narcotics pills per bottles if you do have to worry about tracking devices you have to open every bottle you plan on taking you might get bottles before you have to flee
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably makes people less likely to rob pharmacies knowing that they could be tracked if they dont meticulously open every bottle and check the contents
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they likely do this as soon as possible anyway it is a lot harder to hide a bunch of bottles than a bunch of pills
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmmm that hadnt occurred to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look chief im gonna need a swat team to stop this pharmacy robber seems about right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,one of the battery wires was unplugged when i found it probably by the person that tossed it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,funny thing about it too i vaguely knew the story of this woman from the tv but hadnt paid it much attention until then but on my way out of the police station i grabbed the most recent copy of the local free news and right there on page was the story about her and it mentioned the gps transmitter being in one batch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,honestly that was my very first thought as i reached down to pick it up and for a very brief moment even thought there was a log and some swag inside funny that you should mention that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i hope the person responsible for the theft can get some help for their addiction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the teachin bandit will ride again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the cops were thrilled but her lawyer would probably shrug his shoulders and get back to whatever he was working on im sure it falls somewhere into the cant hurt zone legally but it may help some other part of the case like causing her to cop a plea or admit to something else
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the cops are never your friends even when you know youre innocent except when theyre pulling over drunk drivers on the same highway your loved ones travel or when theyre arresting people who sexually abuse others busting crack dealers or helping evacuate disaster victims
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill have a large farva
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with highway patrol on half
whatisthisthing,not_removed,one of the wires is unplugged
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the front fell off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,broken bad design damaged never worked to begin with dead battery in the woods buried in the snow edit just because its a tracking device does not mean that it somehow gets to break the laws of physics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,subscribed looks like a cool sub
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can testify where you found it im sure just a statement would be enough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the answer to the generic question is this admissible in court is always i dont know what are you using it as evidence of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it probably wont go to trial
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a pharmacy stock bottle they would fill the smaller orangered bottles you normally get from this bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats the street value of a bottle ya think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we used to call those big bottles tanks i may or may not have made poor friend choices when i was younger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think pharmacies buy in bulk and dispense as needed i dont work in a pharmacy but i used to deal with these types of things as a hobby and was once gifted two large bottles of norco that each had take that for what its worth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,street value anywhere from dollars a pop thats dollars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they come in count etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had a friend who somehow got his hand on ct bottles of xanax that group of friends had a wild few weeks tell you that much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does foil reallyahem foil the tracking device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,welp there you go its an asset tracker and it was tucked inside a bottle of very abusable medication there is probably a great story behind how it got lost in the woods
whatisthisthing,not_removed,snort a little bit and see how it goes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can use the pill identifier tool on drugscom to find out what is based on size color and markings
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can google search the markings on it if youre really interested in knowing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,who is this neele and why does he have nose pliers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,electronics pick two small cheap effective
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heard that from my friend fuzzy dunlop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that without a doubt a gps antenna there on the bottom left corner i used to build and operate long range fpv drones and fixed wing rc aircraft no question thats gps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or you put the bottles in a foillined bag and deal with potential tracking devices later
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lower insurance costs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,average police response across the usa is not under five minutes the source i found that agreed with your statement had in cases police responded within five minutes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree if the police had access to the gps data right away if a decoy is snatched off the shelf by a thief a thirdparty security firm will track the device and notify the nypd so you have to wait for the third party security firm to be informed that a robbery has happened then they need to get the information back to the police this would give a criminal enough time to sniff out any tracking devices probably more than enough considering the security firm is unlikely to have staff on who have access to the tracking information
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a quick sweep with a metal detector ought to do the trick as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,snitches get stickers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no that was my first thought i was just almost yelling at the screen to just get rid of it but good call on doing the right thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah sure you found them in the woods bake em away toys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the first thing i thought of posting was does that not make you the target if you take the bait til i scrolled glad it all worked out in the end though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they probably followed you to the police station
whatisthisthing,not_removed,smart enough to disable it but not smart enough to bury it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,crazy this even mentions the bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow kind of makes reading the news a lot more interesting doesnt it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so do you know why the teachers doing it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm that device looks like a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is america so no no she wont
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a thief is definitely a criminal desperate or not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the bottle may have her fingerprints on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the statement that cops are your friends gets a lot harder to make when you are not white
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they may be valuable to society but they still arent going to be my friend of course i will ask them directions if im lost ill thank them for their service ill treat them with respect until the prove they dont deserve it but i sure as hell am not going to freely offer them information when im not directly involved a friend is someone i would go to and know they will try to help me through something without looking at me as a potential suspect right away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,except yknow when they let drunk drivers go
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no those are not typical of a friend but a protector sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you mean a liter of farva
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we use the term amber vial just so ya know have a nice night
whatisthisthing,not_removed,phew
whatisthisthing,not_removed,about sold individually not sure on bulk oxy especially percs sometimes go for less cause of the apap goes about a dollar a milligram most places sauce ex opiate user clean for a month now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,considering what i pay for just about anything medicinal these days must be millions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in my area they go for depending how far removed from the source you are dealerbulk price is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh that totally makes sense now its the bottle on the shelf not the one you take home brain no work today also sounds like an interesting hobby haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wait are you saying you get of cii medications a week or just pills in general because one is believable and the other is gonna require you to tell me where the pharmacy is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in case no one else mentioned it placing a device in something such as a paint can would likely prevent any communication i remember reading about it last year in one of my computer forensic books i believe it was a makeshift method for isolating an electronic device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unlike that other guy whos just assuming go look it up even if its still able to connect to a cell network to send its location the abilities of the gps antenna will be greatly reduced if not negated with enough foil one old tool for shoplifting items that have the radio tags is called a magic bag or booster bag its a bag that the inside is lined in foil while different application of radio technology the use of them shows that using foil to defeat antitheft measures that utilize radio technology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikifaradaycage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not reliably no youd want something like to be certain of blocking a signal i can wrap my cell phone in foil and still ping it faraday cages are harder than people seem to think ive been in a big one a room built for testing radio equipment and even with the door closed but not latched you could still receive local broadcast stations you had to use the locking mechanism to pull the door tight against its seals and then itd block the signal a single packet from that tracker even without a gps lock could ruin your day if youre a pharmacy thief if foil is all youve got then itd be better than nothing and would probably cut the signal enough to let you get away i just wouldnt count on it and foils fragile id go with a fine wire mesh bag with a zipper and probably double bag it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no but a microwave will
whatisthisthing,not_removed,something tells me it wasnt exactly lost one of the battery wires was unplugged too i suspect somebody opened a bottle and said oh shit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hell there was a lot serial number and a phone number on the bottle the pills that were in there had been sitting in an open bottle in the snow for a couple of months and now in thawing weather they were recognizable as pills but that was about all they were starting to fall apart from moisture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,small and loud could be interchangeable i have small cheap effective pcs that are just very noisy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if they make my iphone thicker can they make the battery last more than hours
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reminds me of film production standards fast cheap quality product you may only have two
whatisthisthing,not_removed,opposite for gpus and a lot of other electronics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol exactly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,putting a lot of faith in tin foil have you ever actually tested how effectively it works or are you just blindly trusting it to work because it doesnt work nearly as well as youd think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it helps that a lot of people doing criminal stuff are screwing up shortterm plans
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe pass a metal detector like the kind they use at airports on the bottles and if they ring them then toss them then again this can be foiled by putting a small piece of metal within the bottle or cap than can set them off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a faraday cage would work better
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at that rate you should probably assume an under five minute response time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well half the time the average is wrong so if i was a criminal id time things to the more pessimistic number
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you assume that the notifications arent automated and you further assume that the police cant poll the data directly both are terrible assumptions as they fly in the face of common practice its safe to assume that when accelerometer data andor periodic updates from one of the devices indicates it has moved from its set position it automatically triggers and notifies police
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and burn through the witches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,classic nygma
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what did you say chief
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everyone knows chucking something as far as you can into the woods is basically the same as burying it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this makes me sad she became addicted to pain meds after spinal surgery i was addicted to heroin on my own accord wish i had an excuse for a long while but clean now and plan to stay that way i still go to group sessions once every two weeks and am a huge fan of suboxone in a controlled environment of the people who go into my group and see the suboxone doctor are there because regular doctors lead them there through over prescribing i am routinely blown away at what some of these people were prescribed i had doctors look at me funny if i tell them i am in a lot of pain yet some people are prescribed perc a month plus thrity mg oc a month to deal with their painful back spasms doctors let these people take to different types of pain meds at huge doses over years and then one day decide to cut them off or the dea shuts down the doctor leaving the poor addict to fend for themselves the majority of these pain med addicts have no idea that they are addicts they are people who have never done anything wrong in their life and would never do drugs then one day they cant get meds so they buy some on the street or the try to fill a prescription twice and bam they are a felon in my group i attend there is a year old grandmother and she is on probation as a felon she had no idea why she was feeling the way she was she had no idea why she needed more and more more frequently she had no idea that she could get into so much trouble for trying to double fill a prescription she knew it was wrong but she wasnt hurting anybody so after they plastered her face on the local crime magazine and embarrassed her to her family and friendsnow she can get helpas a criminal i am not condoning the pharmacy robbers actions merely explaining that you can get spun out of control solely from your doctor telling you to take these very very quickly addiction is a powerful strange feeling that no one will ever understand unless you are a md in that field or experienced it yourself there are lots of people who claim to understand it because they saw a loved one go through it they understand the negative effects brought on to the users surroundings but not about the users brain chemistry it is impossible to explain but i can tell you that its a terrible lonely lonely feeling the majority of people dont have to deal with that sort of thing so they scoff or look down at the unfortunate people who do for anyone reading this thinking that they would never associate with low life addicts of that nature i promise you that you know someone who is crying on their insides every day just wanting help from someone help from anyone someone to confide in its an embarrassing lonely and terrible way to live desperate people have been known to render desperate deeds edit thank you guys for some reason i dont know if its my app or reddit but it wont let me make comments so i will leave this here there are many ways to get over addiction the only one that actually matters is your willpower you have to want it there was two times in my life where i got clean but i knew deep down that i would turn back to it i knew that at some point i would be using again in almost couldnt even wait for that opportunity when my life was stable enough that i could start using again the most recent time i absolutely knew that that was going to be it i still have to be cautious but ive never been more serious about it in my life thank you for the gold and the other user i would agree that suboxone saved my life people argue that it is just as bad as doing drugs but i would argue that when i was using i was spending to dollars a day going into massive debt knowingly at that i was lying to every single person who i knew i was an emotional wreck on the inside lost my girlfriend my house fell apart and almost lost my job since the suboxone i have lost pounds i started working out i even ran a i got back with my girlfriend and we are extremely happy i got another job and im kicking ass there the suboxone doctor cost me after insurance a month that is a far cry from where i was edit there is one more thing i would like to add there is something that absolutely wrecks me when i think about i am even crying as i begin to type this i had the luxury of having fairly well off deeply loving parents who gave me the proper tough love and even some financial help during my period of getting clean i hate that there are sooo many people that have nothing like that it makes me so sad to think that there are people who dont have parents or even resources like i did i would be nothing without them having no one in your life to help you when you are down must be the scariest thing in the world and i wish i could help everyone or point them in the right direction final edit i swear this has been an extremely emotional hours for me i have read countless private messages from people detailing their struggles their life and battles with addiction if anybody ever wants to message me because they are struggling with addiction or know somebody who is i would be happy to at least listen thank all of you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup attempts to track the dummy bottle failed because the gps did not work yeah because she pulled the wire apart before tossing it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pain with make people do crazy things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as a physician that also has specialized training in pain medicine i would like the opportunity to respond to the this excellent post about the cycle of addiction physicians are massively responsible for contributing to the opioid epidemic in this country a large part of this is because doctors without training in opioid management are responsible for prescribing this highly addictive class of medications and often do so for the wrong reasons opioids are not appropriate for the treatment of chronic pains such as back pain fibromyalgia crps to name the most common bare with me through the science but basically the bottom line is the more narcotic pain medicine someone takes the less effective it becomes the opioid binds to among others the mu pain receptor like a key into a molecular lock that joining produces pain relief but the body is smart the longer someone takes these medications the longer that lock is occupied by the narcotic the body deals with this unnatural phenomenon by increasing the number of my opioid receptors making more pain receptors the longer you take the narcotic so these people who are prescribed narcotic for years with no exit plan are doomed to increased doses to cover the extra receptors with time unfortunately the adverse side effects are in play at lower doses at that point that the doses required for pain relief so these people are then doomed to awful constipation sedation grogginess lack of motivation and on top of this they will still have pain there is additionally a phenomenon of what we call opioid induced hyperalgesia in other words the longer you take opioids the more likely the body is to respond to pain in an exaggerated way even small painful stimuli that an opioidnaive patient would be able to tolerate like a flu shot will feel excruciating to someone on high doses of opioids for years believe it or not many doctors dont understand this when patients come in saying they have increased back pain they are looked at suspiciously and labeled as drugseekers when they get surgery and require a lot more medication to control the pain than a normal person the staff is easily frustrated and treats them as manipulative sometimes they are labeled as addicts many of these people are not addicts there is a medical difference between addiction and dependence when you are prescribed a narcotic and take it as prescribed for pain control and experience withdrawal symptoms when the medication wears off this is dependence this would happen to even cancer patients on opioids for pain and worst of all when people come in with chronic pains their doctor gives them opioids we doom people to a lifetime of pain and complications due to our own misunderstanding of the mechanism of these dangerous drugs but doctors are not solely to blame unfortunately as our healthcare system moves towards patient satisfaction driven compensation rather than outcome driven the incentive to continue narcotic prescription for patients already on them is strong patients usually do not want to hear that their pain medication will be reduced or weaned even if it is for their own good explaining the above and convincing a person that what doctors have done and how they have practiced during the opioid pharmaceutical surge over the last years is something we now know to be wrong is very difficult there is a responsible way to wean opioids but in the environment of increased patient burden and demand for efficicency we only have so much time to explain this all to people in one visit often patients will walk out of the office before youre done outlining a plan and they walk out unsatisfied which then translates to lower compensation ideally physicians would be compensated in proportion to practicing sound medical guidelines no narcotic for chronic pain even if it makes the patient unhappy pharma companies are also a piece of this puzzle if anyone is interested there is an excellent times investigation on the development of long acting oxycontin and the unethical marketing and distribution the companies would undertake to push this harmful drug i can comment on this if there is enough interest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fun fact west st paul is directly south of st paul
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it mentions percocet pills isnt it the law in america that each pill found without a valid prescription is a felony
whatisthisthing,not_removed,especially local news fear mongering stories and highschool football updatesrecaps every now and then they throw in some cute story about a dog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably teaches middle school
whatisthisthing,not_removed,drugs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone posted an article idk if it was about the same teacher op is talking about but the teacher in the article did it bc she became addicted to pain killers after a spine injury years ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyll learn how to be more successful at getting away with their addiction after a few years in criminal college so thats not necessarily the case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doesnt chain of evidence come into play
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doubtful in most cases fingerprints cant be picked up anymore after a few days especially on nonporous materials
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really you and i both now thats not true
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you a pharmacist do all controlled substances bottles contain these devices
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we use the term amber vial just so ya know have a nice night this is one of those linguistically interesting cases where the use of commasplices completely changes the meaning of the utterance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,congrats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is apap is that the thing in tylenol maybe making it harder to abuse because of the liver toxicity
whatisthisthing,not_removed,totally depends on the state in florida they were each maybe more now since the clinic crackdowns while up in the north east they were each
whatisthisthing,not_removed,keep it up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fwiw ive read you should put your phone in the refrigerator to prevent it from communicating seems like good advice a refrigerator is a plausible faraday cage but try it i did put phone in fridge closed door called phone from landline heard ringing in fridge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,brass mesh works it forms a faraday cage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all that did was cover my phone in paint
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the last paint cans i bought were plastic make sure you use a metal one for this purpose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would a cookie tin work why would people suggest a special faraday cage pouch if something like a tin works
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was my first thought too and ive effectively blocked gps before with just some foil but having an actively transmitting cellular transceiver seems like a huge liability too they could get at least your general location by doing cell tower triangulation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or a knowledgeable thief took a bunch of bottles then paused in the woods to find and lose the tracking decoy its like those fake cash bundles in bank heists
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah this i would love to know too we use these thick loaves of phonesphonesized tablets at my work place for keeping tabs on inventory and they would easily last two days of constant use wifi virtualremote pc use theyre not bulky in an old way and certainly not weak in terms of performance just thick why cant consumer phones just be thicker for a better battery life i mean were already moving away from smaller phones it seems hard enough to find a high performance phone that isnt a huge slab obviously people dont mind if its a bit bigger just add some thickness to it while youre at it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what iphone do you have mine lasts about hours between charges
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hes a pharmacy robbing junkie they are not the foremost empiricists
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont use narcotics or steal them but i know electronics aluminum foil would work just fine for blocking gps or rf or anything else just sayin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and putting a lot of faith in junkies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,enough to get out of the area before the cops come passenger could go through the bottles as you drive away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it works pretty damn good in my experience against gps i used to when i was playing pokemon go actually to try to induce gps drift it worked too well i had to find the absolute perfect amount of opening to have it drift without blocking it entirely if i covered it entirely or even most of the way it would prevent my phone location services from working i have no idea if the police have amazing super trackers or something but i think gps is pretty standard across devices
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct i was merely being contrary and a quick google image search didnt come up with anything that was recognizably a faraday cage built into a bag that said i assume a gps tracker like this would operate as a cellphone which would mean its one or more of the following frequencies none of those are particularly good at penetrating aluminum i bet just using aluminum foil would effectively disable the tracker what would be helpful would be a walkin faraday cage that could be used to inspect the items placed inside the back and disable any transmitters before exposing them to the outside world
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its ok we only have a in chance of going to jail tonight

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is true source last harry potter movie
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah tossed out of a moving car i guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its late but im right there with you exjunkie suboxone saved my life etc it really is unfortunate what the mass over prescription of opiates have done to our society i have lost countless friends to prison and death because of doctors overprescribing drugs to them early on and them getting personally hooked or selling them and getting others hooked glad your well and enjoy the gold too many people dont comprehend the reality of this shit and i hope more people see your post now cheers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for having some empathy dude wasnt exactly expecting to at first but as soon as i saw that line in the article about her getting addicted to pain medication after breaking her spine my heart just sort of sank
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow thanks for telling your story what got you through it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look im an er doctor fact is if you get addicted to prescription narcotics it is not our fault look at the kind of shit we put up with when we dont give narcotics httppancreatitisfactscompancreatitisandthedreadedervisit the fact is some doctors feel that it is better to enable a junkie than to not help someone who is pain sometimes we cant tell sometimes we are wrong the more addicts who say doctors did this to me the fewer doctors there will be who are willing to prescribe narcotics and the more people there will be in constant pain the pendulum swings back and forth between too much prescribing and not enough prescribing and will continue to do so until people take personal responsibility for their own issues addiction is partly a medical problem but its your medical problem not your doctors own up to it if you are taking narcotics and it is affecting your life negatively you are an addict get help getting off the drugs stop asking for more because we doctors dont actually know if you are in pain or not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you so much for sharing this you out it in such relatable terms i wish i could share this with everyone total rbestof material
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think there is some user responsibility too though i inherited multiple patients on chronic pain meds most were either on large doses or didnt have a medically clear reason to be on them currently all but one of my patients is at or under the recommended meds daily which means we did a lot of dose decreasing i counseled every single patient on these meds consequences of longterm use and why were trying to limit them every single one scoffed no one thinks theyll be the one with the problem they dont want to come in every months which is a clinic policy not something i just made up to make things difficult they dont want to sign pain management agreements i dont want anyone to be in pain but im also trying to prevent issues down the line issues we know are occurring and in large numbers nationally we have a big problem right now did you know america uses of the worlds narcotics how insane is that we have people in chronic pain providers who will continually escalate doses few other drug options and limited resources for other treatments in my region we dont have even have a pain specialist its frustrating for all of us lastly congratulations on turning things around i hope life continues to go well for you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im saving this comment to show my technician that has a negative view of recovering addicts all my attempts to get the reality of the disease of addiction through to her has fallen on deaf ears so hopefully a personal account like this will help best of luck to you friend
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably laughable experience compared to others but i was dealing with shoulder pain and had been given a prescription for hydrocodone and had it extended once for about a month before surgery after surgery they gave me something more powerful perocet maybe i dont remember for sure and then more hydrocodone when i had complications with pt after so maybe months solid on pain meds i stopped taking them when i ran out and had a week where i felt the shittiest ive ever felt realized it was withdrawals and i can totally see how this stuff sneaks up on you congrats on being clean getting healthy and straightening out

whatisthisthing,not_removed,welcome to the life of college football athletes they cant use weed and the team docs prescribe em opiates like hell to manage the pain after they are off the team they have to fend for themselves its no wonder a lot of them end up in jail its time for the ncaa to wake up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been putting calling off my dad for weeks because i have gotten to the end of my compassion for his alcohol addiction i just called him thanks to you youre strong and inspiring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hit home on a lot of levels id make a white privilege joke but thats how it really is addiction can be anywhere and the money has to be spent to get help the physical and mental stress are just to much to bottle up and live through the locked up ones that are still sick also hard to think about the difference between good doctors and clinics and groups trying to help vs a cell its just to much to overcome for so many
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any suggestions on treatment options for opiate addicts living with serious chronic untreatable pain a loved ones doctor has been prescribing her extremely high doses of oxycontin and fentanyl for years now and its taking a serious toll shes a mess and her body cant take this much longer there are lots of options to help get her off of opiates but how do we address pain management moving forward im worried that if we simply help her scale back shell just gradually need more over time and be back to where she started its a very difficult situation for our family and were desperate for some direction here would truly appreciate any insight
whatisthisthing,not_removed,username checks out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i got addicted to oxycodone after being prescribed granted i went to a pill mill intentionally to get a script intending just to sell them cause it was worth a year first time i did oxys or xanax was my first visit to the doc cause i had to piss dirty to get them cause i had to claim i was already getting them prescribed as i was supposedly switching doctors i eventually went on subaxone not realizing i would get addicted to that as well but i feel like the subaxone withdrawls were almost worse they were more psychological and long lasting i think a few weeks where the oxys where more physical pain but much shorter i think a few days but i also have good parents with resources cant imagine getting away from that without them still feel fucked up from them tho prob partially from the psychological trauma i put myself through since i was numb and wasnt noticing any red flags and didnt care coping with all that guilt is a bitch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been addicted to adderall after years on a script caffeine pills coffee energy drinks etc mdma and weed yes its possible and ill be honest the hardest to quit were weed and mdma because they actually brought me happiness on another note im a technology addict i literally go through symptoms of withdrawal mental not physical for i havent been online in an hour i check reddit so often i am sick of the front page hours into the day i have no idea where to go for help for this because my college major is cyber security i chose a path where my addiction follows
whatisthisthing,not_removed,powerful message i think a huge roadblock to understanding addiction is how were indoctrinated to believe that junkies are all losers by the war on drugs i grew up in dare and listening to mcgruff the crime dog so i had a very dim view of junkies as criminals who could just choose not to be but wouldnt while i think educating kids about the dangers of drug addiction is a good thing i wish so much that they could find a way to intertwine the dont do drugs message with stories like yourslike the year old in your group thanks again for sharing this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a hard time having sympathy for old white people who become addicted to pain pills then suddenly claim its not their fault while at the same time treating poorer minorities that have the same problems as if they are subhuman and should all be enslaved in prison yeah addiction is real but its real for everyone nobody gave a shit about drug addiction until it started to affect rich white people now suddenly its in the news when its been a problem for decades in minority communities
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this will get buried but if suboxone can be used for opiod addiction and it works for pain why are we still using the bad stuff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive never dealt with addiction but i just wan to say i wish you the best i know a few people from school who are recovering and im sure its tough so i just wanted to say good job on being clean and keep it up for the future cheers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im recovering from spinal surgery and had developed withdrawal symptoms times over the past year and a half now im on a butrans transdermal patch im kinda scared i may be addicted but without im in some serious pain i have a consult coming up for a nerve root stimulation device to be planted into my back id just like to not be in constant pain ive beaten the withdrawal systems times now lets hope it stays that way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all it takes is one subtle nofx reference to get a person hooked again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,amen brother keep up the good work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpssimsbandcampcomtracktheline first verseevery time i hear it and read another story about folks getting addicted from shit their doctors handed themwellevery doctor that handed the stuff out like candy should be forced to spend their nights at clinics trying to help people recover from the damagefirst do no harm has a pretty loose definition once the money starts rolling in i am glad you are recovering im glad you are sober and that your life is on track again i hope that on the last day of your suboxone therapy that you will burn that moment of being free and being alive and being loved into your heart so deeply that no temptation will ever touch it i hope you share that feeling with every person you meet and that you will be the light they need to get out from under too be blessed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for anyone else with this problem look into vivitrol shots they arnt really advertised i had a monkey on my back for awhile when i was younger fell into this because of the work i was doing at the time but my parents did lots of research and happened to talk me into the shots its kinda expensive but worth it and id say it has probably a higher chance of getting clean then rehab
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the feeling when i realised i hadnt taken valium for a month was great
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im a poppy seed tea addict what i take is perfectly legal but i do illegal things to get it and i hate it and its pretty much ruined my life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,man that last part having family and friends or anybody in general to help you through a tough time like that is truly a blessing and it really is sad that not many have that i know im a bit late on this post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i see a doctor to help me wean off of klonopin another drug that is legitimately helpful but that is addictive i had no idea how addictive it was when i started taking notes it to control panic attacks most of my doctors patients are suboxone patients and often he talks with about his experience with these people not using specifics he doesnt violate any confidentiality laws his sentiments and experience very much mirror yours but his colleagues and the pharmacists in the area who fill the suboxone scripts feel differently they dont understand that these are real people and so they villainize them and make them the other maybe because they dont want to believe that it can happen to anyone people who get addicted arent weak they are human we are all vulnerable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,methadone saved my addicted ass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i went through a similar stint not opiates but alcohol someone in group had mentioned something that has really resonated with me basically he said life had to kick the shit out of him to be humble enough to accept help i think defining it as hitting rock bottom or wanting it enough wasnt helpful for me i had to realize that i was sick of suffering eat a big ol slice of humble pie and start dragging the shattered pieces of my life back together there is solidarity in the fight im right there with you brother
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i understand if you dont get back to me cause of all the feedback you have gotten but im curious why you still use the suboxen ive only been clean from heroin for a week today suboxen was used to help with withdrawels but i took my last little piece of a strip this morning and feel very confident that ill feel fine tomorrow morning not knocking you for still using the suboxen btw just think maybe you know something i dont
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was on suboxone for years suboxone is the devil it is no more than a substitution if you really want to change your life get off that shit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fuck doctors im from florida and theyre pill pushing fucks got my wisdom teeth out and they gave me oxycodone my buddy was on vyvanse when he was fucking a day as a full grown man of that shit floors me for at least like its way more intense than cocaine if i ever become a father theres no chance in hell im medicating my kid like that when theyre old enough to make their own decisions they can decide for themselves
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the war on drugs has been a terrible tragic stain on americas history i cant wait till our nation turns its back on this ludicrous stage and realizes the proper way to deal with drug use is treatment sure some people just arent going to respond to treatment but that doesnt justify spending trillions of dollars turning our local police into paramilitary units or ruining killing and criminalizing the millions of lives affected by the drug war it is time for americans to stand up and tell our elected representatives we wont stand for it anymore im glad you shared your story it is a story all to common in the american landscape but im happy to hear your story has a happier outcome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah the doc i saw for my back had me on plus dilauded per month i dont want to get started on the fentynol patches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im do well on narcotic pain meds and have a decently high tolerance for pain doctors actually look at me funny when i tell them i dont want the pain meds and then hand me a script for them anyway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the suboxone doctor cost me after insurance a month christ thats still a hell of a lot that would be pretty much impossible for someone making minimum wage and a lot of people are here in canada with zero coverage suboxone or methadone would be a day to pay the prescription costs which is still a bit more than a month however with pretty much any basic drug plan including the one someone would get while on welfare the drug cost is seeing the doctor is free a lot of addicts have lost their jobs and are in desperate situations having to get on a a month plan to deal with the problem seems pretty crazy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i hear you with the prescribed drugs im a nurse at an addiction detox centre and the saddest cases are individuals who come in having done no drugs in their life and theyre addicted to something their doctor put them on i had someone come in on sunday with a prescription for oxycontin and his doctor was trying to help him ween off and he couldnt handle the symptoms so he was buying on the side just so he could be comfortable enough to go to his job and live like a normal person he doesnt want any of this hed rather deal with all of the knee pain in the world than have to be on this shit its a bad feeling knowing your body cant handle living without your drug especially if its not your fault one time a guy came in and his doctor had been prescribing him of fentanyl patches for chronic back pain for those of you who dont know thats abuse and that doctor should be fired that is so much drug i never do this but i cried for him
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvohguwyfechi ill just leave this here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i too was helped dramatically by suboxone im not years sober been off the subs for and couldnt be happier i too had wonderful well off parents who were emotionally available for me when i needed a helping hand but i do want to say i know a lot of people who also had that who never accepted the help on top of this i personally use a step program and know a large number of users who pulled themselves up and out of the despair with just the group by their side none of us know why we get sober or how we stay that way but we can group together like penguins in the winter and weather storm on top of all that i know am a lover to my normal drug free girlfriend a good employer a responsible pet owner and a sponsor pretty good for an exjunkie
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just another redditor saying thanks for writing this story
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its almost as if im reading what i typed at another forum man we have a very similar view on the addiction part i can tell i have gone through those things also most of them and gone through some serious medical issues that i did not have the odds on my side at all the docs even told me and my parents straight out its time to gather your loved ones because this one will probably not go good this one anyway two summers ago this legal fentanyl from china hit my city hard i had fallen into my old habits and were smoking a lot of apvp and got on the fentanyl powder and patch train bad bad idea for an old opiate fiend like me i can admit that i can not handle fentanyl i can handle heroin better than anyone i know even with needles and it being my drug of choice but fentanyl is the devils spawn i cannot handle that crap i end up overdosing either from iving a tiny sliver to much or taking too many xanaxes and smoking a trail to much of fentanyl and its or here in sweden and the naloxone injection at the er or at some point my x girlfriend actually managed to pump my arrested heart back into motion again and me getting life back i thanked her million times for that one i cannot handle fentanyl its not good for my type of addict the one that always wants the higher high and keep pushing the boundaries fentanyl do not like those like us it kills us real fast and early great read anyways mate i am in the buprenorphine program i managed to talk my way into getting pure buprenorphine tabletts instead of the suboxone pills that are allways put on patients here and it is working like a charm im even at a lower bupe dose than when i were on suboxone take care
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh crap you just described my relationship with food
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am a fan of suboxone in a controlled enviroment that shits an opioid too man let go of that shit year months opiate free
whatisthisthing,not_removed,she should have thrown it onto a train or on a semi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats for damn sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i vote for everyone calling prison criminal college until the system gets reformed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so a lawyer would argue op was the one to put her fingerprints on it after finding it or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,butbutcis miami taught me fingerprints can be found up to thirty years on a hammerleft outsidein a tree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have old dvds i havent taken out of the case in years and my prints are still clear af on there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you check the article linked in another comment it says nypd is specifically doing this with oxy in partnership with purdue the manufacturer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,am pharmacy tech and no no bottles that we use in the pharmacy have anything like this this is purely something from law enforcement
whatisthisthing,not_removed,of course not have a nice night
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is the other meaning i dont see it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nacetylparaaminophenol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes apap is acetominophen tylenol but its because tylenol helps lower the amount of opioid needed for pain control
whatisthisthing,not_removed,apap is the tylenol ingredient it makes the opiates more effective from what i understand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its extremely easy to remove the apap with a cold water extraction cold water will dissolve the opiate and keep the apap solid and you strain it with a coffee filter or an extremely fine mesh strainer then you can take them without the risk of liver toxicity from the acetaminophen any user would know how to remove it its more for helping people who actually use them for pain and dont abuse them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,acetaminophen also known as paracetamol in europe sold commonly under the name tylenol 😊 its an analgesic and they combine it with oxy to prevent abuse and to add to the painkilling power of the oxy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah blues used to be super cheap when were about people would actually get pissed off if you offered them blues i hear but now since its the primary abusable form of oxy the price has skyrocketed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre now between in central florida
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks brah 😝
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its surprisingly hard to make an effective faraday cage it needs to be a continuous gapfree very conductive surface with no voids larger than some fraction of the wavelength you expect to block and its kind of counterintuitive what kind of gapsvoids impact its ability to block rf of various frequencies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your fridge has a big gap where the rubber seal is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have no idea how well they would work but you can buy phone signal blocking bags from china
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ik that metal drink shakers do in fact work as faraday cages last time i checked unless changed that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,arent microwaves also a good for that or was the snowden movie a lie
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id bet money thats what happened
whatisthisthing,not_removed,instructions unclear cpu melted sent from my iphone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure small cheap and quiet is much better
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mean how loud could a house fire possibly be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i whisper to it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah clip on a playing card ace of spades only please
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why cant consumer phones just be thicker for a better battery life because consumers are stupid and iphones are shiny
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well one pharmacy robbing junkie was smart enough to avoid pursuit by getting rid of the tracking bottle in the woods
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre completely sure about that i ask because i can put my phone in an ammo can and it rings when i dial makeshift faraday cages arent perfect when it comes to rf

whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you see upvotes know that over people are silently agreeing with the pain we know youre not alone life does get better especially when we know were not alone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i really wish it wasnt such a problem too as i get the opposite treatment of the time i go to the doctor in pain i am given advil or aleve never muscle relaxer never real pain meds nothing doctors are so concerned about giving out stronger pain meds they wont give me anything ive honestly never taken anything stronger than advil despite times having back spasm so strong they kept me in bed almost in tears for days yeah thanks doc i can get advil without your help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,stumbling upon this just made my morning addiction took me from my loving family and a full academic scholarship at ut to jails and homelessness i was a lying cheating stealing wreck there was so much shame because that is not who i am i am a caring person once youre in that cycle it is mentally nearly impossible to break out which is where suboxone comes into my story i put together a couple months clean a couple of times but could never shake the fixation suboxone gave me my choices back and gave my family their caring loved one back most dont know that i am prescribed and i have frequently heard those around me trash sub users they are naive sure many people abuse the drug but many others have been given back to society and their families the hard times gave me a fortitude that is my bedrock and the sub solidified that fortitude not that i havent slipped i am coming out of a relationship w an addict as we speak in years i have gone from homeless broke tons of probation and away from a drivers licenseto where i am nowwarehouseproject manager for a major commercial construction company college graduate fines paid car paid formoney in the bank who genuinely puts his family and friends him thank god for that lil orange helper and screw anyone who has a problemeveryone benefits from me having this advantage sorry for length and cell phone typing and thank you guysi believe there is no wrong way to recoverjust recover
whatisthisthing,not_removed,now that theyve cracked down on pill mills theres a huge ruse in heroine usage and everyone is wondering why
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as another recovering addict months clean its taken me a lot of support from family and friends meetings a couple of relapses hospitalization cutting off a lot of people that i used to be close to more willpower than i thought i had and a good amount of pain no one told me when i was a kid and got started on heavier things that once youre an addict youre an addict for life it doesnt matter how long youve been clean youre still an addict its weird trying to find yourself again after drugs become your life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think that an er doc treating an acute case of pain with a limited amount of low to moderate dose narcotic is a world different from the pain management clinics these clinics hastily pump massive quantities of patients through sometimes without any assessment tests at all basically the process is a phone call lengthy wait for an appointment brief chat with an intake nurse who may or may not be a nurse leading to a rubberstamp insurance worthy diagnosis of intractable pain and with that youve just become a money machine they will press for transdermal patches transmucosal lollipops electrical spinal stimulators implantable pain pumps ketamine comasdo they work maybe maybe not doesnt really matter they get paid they get paid very very well then theres conference and speaking fees and sometimes fraud each of those drugs costs thousands of dollars a month per patient and the patients wont leave they cant because it very very literally feels like they are dying right now if they try to its a big business its terribly sad and when you look at a patient on too many pain meds and you get angry peopleyour anger is very misplaced it is not the er doc that is providing comfort vicodin is not going to get anyone hooked its the pain management clinics that sprung up suddenly to help the massive drug companies make more money from a population bubble of people that they saw coming this was careful planning to maximize profits and it worked the lady with the back injury who was given oxycontin for years rather than a solid weight lossphysical therapysurgerymedical management plan shes not your villain people
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i totally agree with you and i meant no offense i totally understand the pendulum analogy and it must be maddening for you i guess its not so much the overprescribing that i find issue with its that theyre on their own after you have either written them the prescription or stopped writing them the prescription i think the majority of doctors would rather just stop giving somebody meds rather than sit down and find a proper treatment program or a different doctor for them im not talking about you personally thats just the vibe i get from the healthcare industry as a whole especially in this country the united states of america it is a moneymaking business and doctors care little about your actual health once you walk out of the office and pay your bill i know thats not your fault either im sure doctors are overworked and underpaid and have to pay too much money in bills to go to school im sure its a very stressful job at least thats the way it seems again im not saying you dont care about people in this thread i have seen the blame go between multiple people doctors pharmacist users insurance mental health programs etc i didnt really try to blame anybody for any problems i was just trying to explain how easy it is to slip through the cracks and be labeled a terrible person the same thing can absolutely happen for a doctor who thought they were just doing the right thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this has to be the most er doctor comment i have seen in a while
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this isnt necessarily an er issue but what about the patients with chronic illnesses who need constant pain meds and dont realize they are addicted before its too late many of these patients are addicted long before they or anyone else would ever recognize symptoms of affecting their lives negatively because not being on the meds is way way worse its extremely difficult for a lot of these patients to distinguish between my body has built up tolerance to the meds i guess i just need a slightly larger dose to be ok and maybe im addicted again this isnt an er issue or at least i dont think it is im not in the us but the type of patients i am talking about would never be seen in an er theyd be with their regular doctor or in a pain treatment clinic and in these instances i think a very large degree of responsibility is or should be on the doctors to look for symptoms of abuse or addiction versus an expected increase in tolerance and conversely if the tolerance becomes too high or if the risk for addiction is too high to get the patient to switch meds they have a swath of medical knowledge regarding how these drugs work the patient doesnt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so why cant an er doc just give days worth of pain meds enough to get them under control until they can talk to their pain doc my friends mother has chronic pancreatitis she described to me an instance where she had essentially the exact same experience as you described she was visiting her daughter outofstate over the weekend so she was not near her regular er or pain doc she had a flareup and had to get it under control normally dilaudid is a bare minimum for managing her pain under a flareup and she had to beg for anything stronger than motrin shes a sweet little lady too earlymid i get that anyone can be an addict and its a balance but honestly in these cases it seems like hipaa is more a curse than a blessing i know you cant just take any joe off the street who says theyve got chronic pain and trust them but there must be some way to validate that yes a patient has chronic pain and yes they need at least x opiate to get it under control and allow you to dispense hours guiltfree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wish you had more upvotes i am a struggling addict and i totally agree with you you err on the side of a patient needing relief people are responsible for themselves only you are capable of monitoring your own equilibrium doctors are here to help and they shouldnt be forced to take responsibility for what only oneself can monitor while not quite the same it reminds me of the concept of innocent until proven guilty one must err on the side of ethical action instead of assuming guilt thats the only way to have a functional law system or a functional healthcare system edit although i assume while on a long term regiment of pain killers doctors explain the risk of addiction that should be a discussion that happens ive only had non refillable prescriptions for pain meds for minor incidents
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is absolutely not your fault as an er doctor you pump it in in high volumes to fight serious pain right now addiction is more a long term thing personally i am more worried about you guys high stress job and easy access to meds dont give in guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im genuinely curious to me it seems like the difference between an addict and someone who has a legitimate need is pretty subjective i take a medication everyday and not having that medication for a day makes me miserable and cranky and tired if someone else suddenly decided that my already controlled medication was illegal or that i no longer needed it it would really really really really suck i could get clean but i dont think i would be better off without my medication in the longterm would purchasing that medication or continuing to want to purchase it make me an addict im honestly curious to hear your response because i could very well be wrong and you obviously have a different perspective than some of the others in this thread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is great to hear and thank you i totally understand how ornery people are when theyre in pain whether they are an addict or not it sounds like you actually care about the wellbeing of these people which some people obviously do not and you were a hundred percent correct that some of it is on the user i didnt mean to just blame doctors i hope i didnt drive that point home that im absolving responsibility from the addict thank you for what you do and thank you for at least understanding but there is more than one side of pain management
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just wrote a few long winded posts about pain management so i will keep this short and just sayi would like to very sincerely thank you on behalf of those patients you sound like an excellent physician not an easy thing to find in my opinion also i would count it as a blessing that you dont have a pain management clinic in your area if you are interested in what i know of a great great many of them the post prior to this in my history discusses keep being a great doc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,let her know that i am self admittedly a piece of shit and did drugs just for pleasure i am not lying when i say percent of the attendees to this group are normal everyday people and not avid drug users and they struggle just the same as i
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely not a laughable experience man congrats to you and being aware enough of what was going on in your body thank you so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh my god thank you man i tell you theres a lot of these messages that are making me bawl my eyes out man im glad you did that thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im currently near that boat with my own dadhes wasting away and im not sure how to deal with it and my own issues with the drink at least hes finally pursuing home healthcare visits now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont feel comfortable giving out medical advice but i will tell you in my group there is a guy who is on suboxone for his third time he is an extremely high doses of painkillers due to an accident he suffered when he was he spends a few years on painkillers and then goes to the suboxin to sort of clear his mind and lower his tolerance to the medicine then he will go back to the painkillers he told me last time that this is his third time for him being on the suboxone it seems to be working a lot better and he never wants to go back on regular painkillers i would speak with a pain management doctor about their options
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would suggest looking into kratom a natural pain reliever that works on the same receptors as narcotics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its funny because thethreadkillers username is very applicable to their comment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,funny thing is ive saw that movie multiple times before i ever even used i guess thats not really funny
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for that yeah i have heard the same thing about suboxone im thankfully on a low dose in my doctor says it will be an easy taper down over a sixmonth period
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i absolutely agree that weed is a dick thing i myself just had to quit a few days ago and its been tough i have quit weed twice in my life and i remember that the first week is really tough and then its just extremely easy after that i dont think theres any real harm and smoking pot everyday as long as its not everyday all day i was never the type of person who would wake up and get high get high and go to work more so once all my chores and stuff is done then take a bong hit and relax hahaha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i totally agree the most dangerous thing about heroin is how they portray it we grew up with that dare program telling us that marijuana was an evil scary drug of course they say the same thing about heroin so when that hormonal teenager smokes pot for the first time they say wow dare lied weed is great they portray that people who use heroin immediately fall into the gutter become a prostitute or riddled with disease scratching their face sick needing a fix and then on the offchance somebody does heroin and they say wow they lied it was cheap im not hungover im not addicted i can do heroin on the weekends we all know where it goes from there but it is not an immediate transition to the gutter they need to be honest and upfront about heroin use and stop just trying to scare people from it and they need to educate more
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unfortunately discrimination is prevalent in every society it is that attitude you speak of that minorities or gutter do i like junkies are beneath older white pill addicts it is simply not true it needs to be changed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are legitimate reasons that people need highstrength painkillers im sure there are more viable solutions for pain management there are people who need fentanyl patches there are people who need milligram oxycontin the problem were facing now is that some doctors are afraid to prescribe anything to people there are people who actually need pain meds who dont get them because doctors are demonized then there are people who dont need shit who were abusing the system ruining it for everybody i would never say that pain killers are bad but they can be terrible for you if used incorrectly i guess it comes down to knowledge and understanding of pain management which a lot of people dont it seems like doctors and patients alike
whatisthisthing,not_removed,suboxone doesnt really help with pain my best friend takes it in high doses to help with his heroin addiction and he definitely feels pain oxy or any other powerful opiate just absolutely obliterates your opioid receptors so you cant feel the pain even though its still there suboxone puts a cap if you will over the receptors so they wont cry out for more and stops the user from going through withdrawals itll dull pain like tiny aches and such but usually ibruprofin will do a better job dulling real pain and anyones who experienced real chronic pain can understand how useless that sentiment is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bupenorphine is a very weak pain reliever in my opinion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,suboxone is what is known as a partial opioid agonist it activates the opioid receptors but has a ceiling effect that helps prevent abuse the full opioid agonists are used when the pain being addressed is above that ceiling level that suboxone provides there are also far less suboxone prescribers than pain med prescribers where i work clients who are engaged in the suboxone program also have to participate in substance abuse counseling to address the clients other needs it has worked wonders with our patients and helped a lot of good people who had crappy circumstances get a second chance at life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for people like you who are in extreme amounts of pain addiction is almost a necessary evil being in pain is a terrible thing if you realize that you might be addicted now just be aware of that and maybe talk about it with your doctor whatever you do if you dont need more medicine then dont take it but if your quality of life is so low due to pain then you may not have any other options period again im not a dr but i think its something you should address with them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they do offer those at the clinic i go to i havent really looked into it seriously but i will thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when i was using heavily i looked into poppy seed tea so many people told me what you said and dont even start i tried to anyway but i couldnt find any i didnt want to order it online cuz i wanted it immediately every so often i would get an urge and drive around to locate some at a store and thankfully never did im sorry to hear what it did to your life have you ever thought about going to a suboxone doctor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have heard klonopin is extremely hard to come off of its good that your doctor share that information with you theres a lot of education that needs to go around on all levels across all platforms thank you for your reply and good luck to you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everybody is different i for one can handle physical withdrawals no problem they are not fun at all but i can handle them and i have been through them multiple times my main struggle is with the mental aspect of it i had been clean for two weeks every single day i would cry tears would just pour out of my eyes in any situation randomly i couldnt not get using out of my head i didnt feel sick i was just mentally destroyed and had nothing going on upstairs the suboxone made me able to live my life one of the main reasons i decided to get on it is because of the naloxone when i take the suboxone i have absolutely zero cravings i dont have crying spouts and was able to get my life back together the naloxone prevents me from even entertaining the idea of doing dope even if i went to go buy a bag and shoot it directly into my vein it wouldnt even work i love that aspect of the medicine i love that even if i went and bought some it wouldnt work i think about heroin from time to time but not in a way that i want to use it or miss it i look back on it negatively i think that if i was not on the suboxin over this last year it would have been extremely possible that i would have slipped up at some point i guess to answer your question i dont think i trusted myself i now think i am capable of getting off of it but i want to do it correctly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,were you on suboxone from a doctor or were you buying it on the street or both were you switching back and forth between suboxone and heroin or other prescription pills what was your dosage does suboxone cost me a month compared to to a month of heroin in the year that ive been on suboxone ive got completely in shape got a new job and already received a promotion and im not a mental wreck anymore i dont lie to people i dont stick needles in my arms and i certainly dont think about using if this is what the devil feels like then i dont know what the fuck heroin was what is worse than the devil i dont plan on being suboxone forever but im not sure why people tell me that its bad for me when the last yearandahalf of my life has been the most productive awesome moments that ive had
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh my god thats awful i have heard that before about florida but i have never experienced that myself what a nightmare
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for that i appreciate it and i completely agree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats good to hear that youre smart enough to realize that i have always had an extremely low pain tolerance something that my family friends and girlfriends of always made fun of me through the years basically they just call me a pussy i had a root canal done on an abscess tooth a couple years ago i was crying at in the morning calling my mother asking for help the doctors had given me a handful of percocet tens but they did absolutely nothing when i called looking for more they basically laughed at me and told me no i knew why they told me know but it pisses me off that there are people who are given times the amount of drugs that they actually need and then somebody like me cant even get a slightly higher dose without the doctors thinking that you are a junkie at that time in my life i was not using heavy drugs so i was not just seeking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes i know it is a lot and that is something else i think about often even if theres somebody who really wanted to get clean and stay clean they may not even be able to afford medicine like that the worst thing i feel about this country is our health care system i realize things need to cost money but when people want help but cant afford it it makes me so sad
whatisthisthing,not_removed,first of all i love your username thank you for your message and thank you for what you do im sure it is a very hard and stressful job i think its extremely easy for people to get complacent with their job and it sounds like you have not empathy is one of the best emotions that i think a person can have and it sounds like you have it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is so great to hear that youve been off the subs for that long that gives me hope that i can accomplish something i know it is going to be tough but its great to hear that from somebody else thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have plans to get off of it im in such a great place in my life right now i cant think of any reason to get off of it immediately other than other peoples opinions i told my doctor i was concerned about becoming somebody who took suboxone for years he asked me why i didnt really have an answer other than i didnt want to be on medication for years his response there are millions of people in this world who take medication every single day for various problems the medication helps the achieve a quality of life that they otherwise could not so what is the problem in that i really didnt have an answer for him again as i said i do plan on getting off of it i am on a very low dose but i see no reason to rush off of it i have experienced acute withdrawal from the suboxone from forgetting to take my medicine it is a scary scary feeling i dont know if im completely ready to do that yet but when i do im going to do it with the help of my doctor in a controlled environment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am a fan of suboxone in a controlled enviroment im pretty sure op doesnt mean personally but as a remedy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lawyer just has to say anything could have happened doesnt have to get specific with it at all chain of evidence is very important in criminal trials if at any point the chain is broken then the evidence is inadmissible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not at all probable but its not impossible thats what matters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and they can find it with a satellite and hack the pixels so the fingerprint can be read from space
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats the confederacy of independent systems doing in miami
whatisthisthing,not_removed,years fingerprints have been found in the best conditions but the world is most not the best conditions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,greasy fingers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh cool thanks for answering
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you dont work in florida do you these are rather common around these parts due to the pill mill days
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why would this one maybe higher risk areas would
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it also is supposed to remove the recreational appeal personally from what ive been prescribed over my life with something with apap i can actually get shit done rather than everything piling up till i heal up enough get through the day without it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also known as the other household item the microwave just dont turn it on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and if you get it wrong doesnt it turn into a big antenna always wondered about that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,anecdotal but the signal blocking pouch i purchased on amazon worked very well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah right youd pay me in fake cash bundles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,still small and cheap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sent from my iphone me hey ive never seen that before on reddit me waaaait a minute
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also because if it starts out with three days of battery life two years later itll still have over a day of life left lower initial capacity means faster frustration and replacement
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats probably true but few other manufacturers seem to try and cater for anything else i just happened to be browsing the phone retailer yesterday and there was like one kind of a more rugged looking phone from samsung yet still the little marketing pitchspec note tried to boast with thinness
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probaly popped one open expecting to get pillsand lucked out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually youre right cell phones are designed to send and receive through building materials including metal and concrete and if youre anywhere in a populated area youre no more than a couple miles from a tower at any given time gps signals are much easier to block as theyre an order of magnitude weaker and coming from miles away plus they dont transmit anything so that can totally be done with foil or a car trunk so if youre lucky youd have a cellular transmitter with no location data but if they try to locate it with cell tower triangulation they could still get your general area blocking a cell signal would be much harder passive would be bulky and active would be expensive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not the foil its the seal ammo crates are notorious for issues as faraday cage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its actually the imperfectness of the faraday cage construction what is making the trouble if the can seal was in perfectly conductive contact along the whole edge very little of outside em fields will couple in altrough above few khz as low as possible volume resistivity of the shielding material is prefferable steel is not the best choice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im gonna come clean here im good with a soldering iron and i like to build robots and stuff but i dont really know what im talking about when it comes to rf i learned something today thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you that means a lot especially after the other guy started acting like all addicts are just people with mental health problems and citing some shit statistics walk a mile in our shoes and see what its like to hate yourself for what youve become and desperately wanting a way out thanks again cheers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uthethreadkiller and uartformarket i imagine this will get lost in the flood of comments especially with this making it to rbestof however i felt compelled to share with you something my older brother wrote in a couple of months before he passed away i found it a few months after he passed and i find it rather profound and relevant to the current topic today i allowed myself to glimpse the sorrows of others coming out through their words or stowed away in the pigmentation of an iris its frightening you see another person becomes irrevocably human after this and perhaps harder to cast aside or assign to the them side of the us vs them equation today i feltcompassion with it comes a desire to reach out yet i doubt myself ive got my own luggage and in all likelihood ill probably just complicate the situation so i will just say that you are loved and whatever your pain know that it has been experienced times before by different people and that i say this not to belittle your experience but hope that you will take solace in knowing that you are never alone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,people now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats because thats the correct treatment for low back pain note especially consider oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids for managing low back pain taking into account potential differences in gastrointestinal liver and cardiorenal toxicity and the persons risk factors including age consider weak opioids with or without paracetamol for managing acute low back pain only if an nsaid is contraindicated not tolerated or has been ineffective do not routinely offer opioids for managing acute low back pain see recommendation do not offer anticonvulsants for managing low back pain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,amen brother glad to hear youre doing well i agree that suboxone saves lives i think what most people misunderstand is that it buys you time to rebuild your life reestablish meaningful relationships find a good job etc once you have some of that youre a lot less likely to throw it all away for a drug none of us really knew what we were getting into until it was too late now that we do we realize its not worth it btw i like how you said everyone benefits from you having suboxone that is incredibly true be well man and thanks for sharing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good shit dude ive got lots of respect for people who get clean i have a few family members who are either in jail for drug trafficking or in hiding because of getting into that mess its a hell of a life not many can escape so more power to you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just have to interject here and say not all pain clinics are like this ive gone to my pain doc for years he does injections epidurals etc and doesnt just push pills hes very well read and up to date on current science and procedures and has a great bedside manner he is the best doctor ive ever had and trust me ive had a lot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i get and norco for an ear infection or a sinus infection every couple months i take or then end up flushing the rest a couple weeks later
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we do i cant tell you the number of patients who go to or ers every day plus lets see you get an appointment with your primary care doctor in days not easy and not everyone can do that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey its actually fairly simple what you have is called tachyphylaxis its a physical dependency on a drug this does not qualify as an addiction unless it begins to affect your life negatively for example the first time you find yourself holding up a liquor store to be able to afford this drug now its an addiction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why did you say that taking drugs just for pleasure makes you a piece of shit thats no different to having a can of coke thats the cocacola type coke with the registered name and all just for pleasure if you continue to take drugs or drink coke even though they no longer give you pleasure or even are now causing you harm then youre addicted still not a piece of shit though thieves and people that talk on a phone in a movie theater now theyre pieces of shit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,focus on your own issues with it you have to be able to treat yourself right before youll be able to treat others with the same kind of patience you can do it absolutely you can youre already doing better than almost everyone because youre saying youve got some issues with it find help there will be people who will give you strength and be understanding when you might not give the same to yourself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i take it this guy was dealing with ongoing pain from the accident most of what i read about suboxone indicates its great for treating addiction but doesnt help with the pain itself is his experience different very interesting a tool to help her regulate her usage to reasonable levels might be useful and i appreciate the sentiment and agree to an extent but pain management doctors are what got her into this mess in the first place thanks a lot man youre a hero
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i took kratom and it put me in the hospital with an acute liver injury it is not for everyone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well said having no personal experience with most drugs i have to rely on the propaganda because frankly i dont have a lot of other references we arent afraid to have former convicts come talk to high school students about their experiences in jail and how they should work to stay out of jail but we seem deathly afraid to allow recovering addicts to do the sameto say yeah i tried this and it seemed ok for a while and before i realized it i was a hopeless addict i think that would be a huge key in educating kids and not having them follow the exact path you described
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you i had read the wikipedia article on it and it sounded like its being used for pain i appreciate you clearing it up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been on suboxone now for years as an ex addict who went through the whole doctor prescribed opioids sideshow i have chronic rheumatoid arthritis which i developed as a juvenile and its very very painful suboxone while it does not completely kill the pain definitely helps enough to make it bearable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,before it was used to treat opiat addiction suboxone was used to treat strong chronic pain and is still the first choice to treat this pain in the elderly since its relatively low risk it would be weird if it didnt kill pain it being an opiod and all i could see that it wont help much when you have blasted your receptors with opiats for years though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,getting off the subs was tough thats for sure mainly i had sleep issues and really jittery nerves and legs but its just about weeks and once its over its over pretty miraculous actually best of luck feel free to dm me if you ever need some tips tricks or wanna chat about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bro that shit is meant for the initial withdrawal for detox about to days your slave to that shit man what if you have to travel without rid yourself of that shit man
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i completely agree with the doctor if its letting you achieve a better quality of life then why just arbitrarily make a decision to ditch it are you going to say a diabetic needs to free herself from her dependence on insulin someone with major depressive disorder needs to get free from their paroxetine addiction there is no onesizefitsall cure for addictionits a deeply personal journey and these decisions need to be made by the person in recovery and the people that know himher andor are involved in their treatment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chain of custody starts when the officers take possession not all evidence is taken directly from the suspect if there were good prints or something else tying the bottle to the defendant it would not be good for her
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah mostly because the tylenol will kill you or destroy your liver before you od on the oxycodone also snorting tylenol sucks ass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unless you want to charge it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,microwaves are designed to block if cell phones use a higher frequency than that no idea the signal wont be blocked
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is not true anymore a lot of modern microwaves leak give it a try
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to some degree yeah or at least a degenerate case of a conductor sitting in open space near a radiating antenna its been far too long since the physics class where i was supposed to actually understand this though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,o shit he knows
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cell phones are designed to send and receive through building materials including metal and concrete blocking a cell signal would be much harder passive would be bulky httpsenwikipediaorgwikifaradaycage it doesnt have to be a lot of metal it just has to completely surround the transmitter and not have any holes that are larger than th the wavelength that is being transmitted fun fact that the wavelength rule is why your phone works in your car but your am radio antenna has to be outside the car cell phone frequencies are small enough to get through your cars windows but the wavelengths am radio operates on are way too big making your car a faraday cage for those frequencies try this at home set your phone screen to stay on for a few minutes turn it on and put your phone in a microwave oven obviously do not turn the microwave on close the door and watch your phone lose service crack the door and watch your service come back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so if youre lucky youd have a cellular transmitter with no location data and they have stingrays and who knows what other equipment at their disposal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this even a gps transmitter though if its simply a beacon itll be pretty easy to find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not grounded but a perfect closed loop ammo can is probably painted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,while i agree people with mental health issues feel like that too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unless they do something like robbing a store they shouldnt be punished as hardened criminals for being so dependent on these drugs they should be helped as victims this war on drugs is ridiculous and only harms those that it promised to protect and more
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah you just described exactly how it feels to have mental health issues addiction and mental illness arent far apart and often lead to each other believe me i would know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this just made my day im at work and had to step away thank you very much for sharing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a peptic ulcer so my stomach bleeds if i take any kind of nsaids when i go to the doctor for my chronic foot pain they say they cant do anything for it even though i am averaging about hours of sleep per night because my feet feel like there are knives sticking out of both of them everyone is so afraid to give a narcotics even though it is probably the only treatment i could do if an older person were going through this same situation they wouldnt hesitate to prescribe pain killers i have tried everything everything i even had one doctor tell me the only way to really fix it would be to cut them both off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you friend there is always hope
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you get opiats for sinus infections i get an antibiotic and thats it i usually buy some ibuprofen myself when it gets to bad you are really overdoing it a bit in the us
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe not for that guy but i can assure you thievery and addiction often go hand in hand dont get me wrong many people manage to get help before it gets to that point but when many addicts say i wont steal use a needle sell my stuff those are big yets i went to rehab years ago for opiate addiction at that point in my life i said and absolutely meant ill never steal use a needle or sell my shit i have almost two months clean right now and i have gruesome track marks down both arms an outrageous debt to repay the people that i can remember stealing from and the only things i own are cheap clothes and tacky furniture i couldnt find someone to buy i had my own house with nice things new technology a great girlfriend whom i was going to marry and adopt her daughter a wonderful job that i loved i had a great life after i got sober last time and for some reason i didnt think taking a few pin pills and going to the movies with a friend every other month would lead into another horrible downward spiral this one much worse than the last i am a piece of shit i love getting high but i also know i have a problem and i cannot do so recreationally ever i realized that when i was first prescribed hydrocodone at years old and for years i refused pain medication in any form for anything because i knew i had a problem but i was pretty severely burned a few years back and had to take it i enjoyed it when i stopped hurting so badly but i had to take it at least for a while thats why started the first downward spiral that eventually led to rehab and im only saying that to show the disparity between them and this last time when i just did it because i wanted to sorry long story for a very small point addiction and thievery often go hand in hand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess i was trying to help bolster his argument against that lady i wanted her to know that there are a lot of junkies and users who are pieces of shit but not every single one i thought that it would make me seem a bit more honest because we were talking about people who gets swept into the lifestyle through medical care rather than drug abuse its painfully apparent in those meetings about who is an avid drug user and who got there legally thank you though i know im not really a piece of shit and i never robbed or stole from anybody
whatisthisthing,not_removed,suboxone is an opiod that is used in the tratment of strong chronic pain so it should work pretty well for pain relieve maybe not so much if youve blasted your opiat receptors with opiats for years though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you so much yes it yes it can be used for pain management i dont really know anything about how well it works compared to other things but that guy who takes it for pain says it is doing wonders for him longterm painkiller use is a terrible thing in people know that so im not sure if hes willing to deal with the pain that is coming on because suboxone is not as strong or its actually working for him completely i will ask him on my next group session in two days if he is there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think thats the difference that you only figure out until its too late strong opioids completely immerse you with endorphins and dopamine so you dont feel and since the pain is so absolutely unbearable not being able to feel at first is a godsend when you dont have the painkillers jacking up your receptors the pain feels even more awful turning the usage into a vicious yoyo cycle it takes someone whos incredibly strong i feel to recognize that some pain bearable pain while shitty is better for your health and mind than the awful cycle of opiate addiction and a lot of people wont come to terms with their long term pain until its too late i guess i should have clarified in my previous statement suboxone doesnt help for pain in the same way many opioid painkillers do and for high pain patients its often not enough to achieve the level of painfree that they dream of congratulations on finding strength i hope you keep it up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i appreciate that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been on it for a little over a year now i thankfully purposefully started out on a very low dose and kept it that way i have plans to get off of it in the next six months with my doctors help i know it is going to be hard but i would like to do that sooner than later i have heard that it is really hard to get off of his well my doctor assures me that a six month to a yearlong taper down can make it as painless and stressfree as possible as not to disrupt my normal everyday life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,suboxone is used for longterm opioid replacement therapy as well most people take it way longer than just for detox
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a diabetic will die without insulin an opiate addict will go through withdrawal and then be fine ive been through it you dont know what your talking about
whatisthisthing,not_removed,snorted aspirin once would not recommend
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the tylenol can be extracted using cold water httpcoldwaterextractioncom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,make sure you have the update first
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if cell phones use a higher frequency than that in this us mhz up to ghz the shielding in a microwave isnt effective though ive seen wifi connections drop when a microwave oven is running the shielding needs to be effective enough that you dont get cataracts not enough that the signal cant be detected by a radio receiver
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ammo cans often have a nonconductive rubber seal or otherwise have a gap that the radio can get through if arent specifically designing to block rf and have conductive seals on everything its pretty hard to do if you have conductive foam or steel wool and conductive copper tape that you can use to block all of the gaps and stuff into the seals its pretty easy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thats not a piece of foil its a faraday cage those were discussed in depth a little further up the thread i was responding to a post about literally just using a piece of foil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah exactly on the other hand looks like ops perp managed to figure it out they probably just went through them all quickly while they were driving away and threw the tracker out the window i bet you can tell just by shaking a bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a very good point if you break down addiction it looks very similar to a mental illness my addiction came about accidentally but definitely manifested itself into a full blown mental illness towards the end my story was that i had cancer got overprescribed painkillers i do not fully blame the doctor because he was only trying to help me through the pain but he could have been a lot more clear on the risks of becoming dependent on them got dependent on them and then they were taken away i started finding them on the street and then graduated to heroin strictly for economic reasons the rest is downhill before cancer though i had a great life two degrees from a private jesuit university played soccer at a very high level etc i didnt have anything that would have typically led me to drugs my mind changed greatly once i got addicted though and my confidence disappeared and i started to hate myself it was at that point it became more of a mental illness than just physical dependence ive been clean for years though but it was not fun it took a lot of counseling and time to work on myself much like a mental illness might it could have been avoided too if i knew the risks a lot more than i did i think there is a big push from big pharma to get people taking as many drugs as possible though and thats unfortunate sorry for the long answer you made a good point and i ranted cheers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree completely i just replied above wirh this but ill copy it here to you too thats a very good point if you break down addiction it looks very similar to a mental illness my addiction came about accidentally but definitely manifested itself into a full blown mental illness towards the end my story was that i had cancer got overprescribed painkillers i do not fully blame the doctor because he was only trying to help me through the pain but he could have been a lot more clear on the risks of becoming dependent on them got dependent on them and then they were taken away i started finding them on the street and then graduated to heroin strictly for economic reasons the rest is downhill before cancer though i had a great life two degrees from a private jesuit university played soccer at a very high level etc i didnt have anything that would have typically led me to drugs my mind changed greatly once i got addicted though and my confidence disappeared and i started to hate myself it was at that point it became more of a mental illness than just physical dependence ive been clean for years though but it was not fun it took a lot of counseling and time to work on myself much like a mental illness might it could have been avoided too if i knew the risks a lot more than i did i think there is a big push from big pharma to get people taking as many drugs as possible though and thats unfortunate sorry for the long answer you made a good point and i ranted cheers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you are most welcome it makes my day knowing that he is still having a positive impact on others close to a decade later
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if an older person were going through this same situation they wouldnt hesitate to prescribe pain killers this is not true in all cases i am yrs old and have several chronic pain issues i get the same party line as you do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,both feet your pain comes from both feet at once and doctors have told you that the source of the pain is coming from the feet themselves thats weird like both of them on cue have something go wrong with them im not saying your doctor is wrong but from your description the first thing that popped into my mind was spinal involvement like nerve root compression if it happens in both feet at once then again it could be related to blood flow true peripheral neuropathy or just really bad luck like complex regional pain syndrome not trying to give you a diagnosis im sure youve heard enough of those symptoms like yours really deserve seeing someone who will conduct a thorough examination youve said you tried everything but i wasnt sure if that entailed medication or healthcare practitioners or both have you tried physical therapy pts can usually find out where the problem is coming from whether its your footfeet or somewhere else and design a treatment program for you for chronic pain its a bit more complex but more than likely its treatable how is it complex well have you ever heard of phantom pain amputees often find that they feel as if the limb that was cut off is still there sometimes its a feeling of being crushed burned or aching this is because although the limb is gone the area of the brain that used to feel that limb is still there and reacts to nearby neurons doing other things because theres no more input it doesnt happen to everybody with an amputation but sometimes it does if the problem was neurological a sensitization of the nerves in your brain to pain from your feet then chopping off the feet wouldnt necessarily fix the problem in the brain and as soon as the anesthesia wore off a patient who underwent that procedure might wake up with the same pain where their feet used to be but no feet even if you dont cut off the feet chronic pain treatment might have a mental component that could involve brain retraining if i were sleeping under hours a night id be surprised if there wasnt sorry to blather and i dont want to scare you or tell you what your problem is it just makes me upset to hear that you feel your pain hasnt been properly acknowledged or managed if you havent tried physical therapy yet or had a poor experience before with someone different were not all bad but were also not all good either haha i strongly encourage you to give it a shot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nine years as of this august it gets easier when you get used to normal life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,low dose how low and how often
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no they dont you dont know what your talking about
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive worked in mental health and addiction recovery for the past years so yes i do know something about it i never said someone would die from opiate withdrawal but that does not mean its not serious or that there are not more underlying issues that might need to be addressed throw chronic pain into the mix and it becomes even more complicated straight out saying you and every other person with opiate addiction needs to stop taking suboxone is completely ridiculous recovery looks different for every person because illness presents differently for every person
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,right the cage in microwaves just stop most of the radiation beyond a few inches dont press your face against a microwave making a perfect cage even just for that one wavelength would be too cumbersome for households and too expensive to justify in many cases

whatisthisthing,not_removed,steering wheel lock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess you are right thanks we live in brazil and these locks are not very common here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah im also from brazil and i used to see steering wheel locks in the but i never seen one of those around here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lets just keep a level head here the reality is you dont know what it is just call the nonemergency number and have the police check it out its probably something someone created to clean out a pipe or something but the police can send a car by to check it out for you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this seems really odd place to place a blood stained cloth looks more like a torch to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks like an httphappyhouseandgardencompropagationoffruitbearingtreesbyairlayering its a technique to propagate plants are your neighbors into landscaping or horticulture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe call the nonemergency number i cant imagine the cops would be mad you told them we dont have a pic to go off and its wrapped so im not sure we can help you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,call non emergency its almost certainly nothing but they will be getting calls about missing milk bottles and god knows what else weird shit happens too i found some bones when i was a kid and once the police came they confirmed it was a human leg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im having a hard time figuring out how this relates to a crime or nefarious activity i wonder if it is some sort of environmental thing maybe you wrap a stick with something to feed the larvae of some sort of beneficial insect or some sort of magic thing paging sam and dean if you do call the police ask if someone can just phone you back instead of stopping by and describe it and see if it means anything to them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres got to be some subreddit about witchcraftblack magicetc maybe youd find something there however read the forum description first for instance rvoodoo appears to be about a music festival not actual magic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is the verdict
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can see if its blood if you have some hydrogen peroxide around put a few drops on the stickthing and see if it foams up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did ask your sketchy neighbor they might just tell you what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,strikes me a some sort of bait trap thing get the scent of blood in the air id watch around that bush that you found it in there might be some sort of trapsnare
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when you are training dogs in tracking wounded game this is what you can use to prepare a blood scent trail for the dog to try finding a good tracking dog can differ two crossing trail from each other they can also when crossing a scent trail determine which direction the trail is leading
whatisthisthing,not_removed,while this might not be the best idea id mist it with water and smell it to see if it smells like blood when wet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i have made some really really crazy looking contraptions to do some convoluted little purpose like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree that it looks like a torch but it smelled terribly rotten and looked soaked in what appears to be blood that is literally the only thing i could compare it to also strange that it was found buried deep in a bush
whatisthisthing,not_removed,torch is a good guess thats what i would have said
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this might be it utightbuttholebandit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the only thing weird about it is that it smelled like rotting meat it looked very unnatural compared to the other pictures
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry im on mobile i uploaded a picture but it might not be visible to some
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op is dead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe they incorporated some bloodbone meal into the mixture its literally ground bones and dried blood and smells appropriately terrible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,closer pic what were you doing on your sketchy neighbors property
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op did you died
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in a large bush in the front yard my buddy saw it deep in the bush when we were throwing the disk around
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hi this has
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lexus is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lexus is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rcoins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,new england is full of old cellar holes as a kid i used to love finding these out in the woods sometimes you can find some cool stuff buried in and around them that may be what you have here or it could be some other sort of excavation seeing as this is on a lake shore it may well have been someones camp or something but without knowing where this is exactly its only wild speculation as for age those trees are probably years old or so if hardwood younger if theyre conifers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpimgurcomasyvni the hole is about feet at its deepest roughly feet theres also what looks to be an old chimney possibly from a fire place or cooking stove ive seen about of these footprints in a couple different town parks this is the only one where ive noticed old bricks also if it was a structure it wouldve had to be pretty old for a tree that sixlze to grow there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cant say its what youre finding but where im from when you find these they most often denote the place a large tree at some point in the distant think of years past fellbleweroded over with the root structure and has since rotted away the hole it leaves takes many many years to normalize if the brick structure was to be a chimney or something similar it would need a much more solid foundation kick it around a bit and see if you find concrete or rock below it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a structure almost impossible to know without an excavation however on extremely common type is lumber camps they would move in and clear cut the area when they had expanded too far they would abandon the camp and move your site is near a water source which is also desirable for floating the logs to the mill the bricks are a bit odd usually they would bring pot belly stoves but it could be something as simple as the clay for the bricks being readily available in the area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could have been a trash burning pit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a relatively young cellar hole for certain id have to know more about the orientation to say whether or not the bricks are from a fireplace or not you might have found the foundation of the front steps try looking for some old year ish topo maps of the area and see if you can spot it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,depending on the age of the wooded area its often pitandmound topography bricks in this case would rule that out httpsenwikipediaorgwikipitandmoundtopography
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could also be an old maple sugar camp being in new england
whatisthisthing,not_removed,simlish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are letters which can be read by rotating the image first is tcy in a form which is an inverted y second seems to be ju third could be either xx or ww the fourth could be u the spiral seems to indicate the direction to rotate the image to decipher the message
whatisthisthing,not_removed,one of the characters could pass for an httpsenwikipediaorgwikiyngvitheingwazrune but the rest seem like gibberish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it sort of looks like a pan for a scale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,part of a salt shaker missing ring like a ball jar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im pretty sure thats just dried caulking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these are unspawned lizards we have the same things in australia try do a time lapse and see if you can get them hatching would be cool to see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree looks like maybe a garbage can got set on top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely correct

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess would be for air conditioning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats my guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so this is my girlfriends familys zither and its been in storage and not treated properly for who knows how long im hoping to restore it as a christmas present but i want to figure out the make and model just to have some more info i have no info on this because the back piece was destroyedremoved at some point and replaced with shitty plywood i know that its a zither from c i think its a guitar zither as opposed to a concert zither but the strings on the right half of the instrument are paired in octaves there are pins so the rightmost strings are paired to form notes and the leftmost strings are in four groups forming four chords of four notes each so thats what i know any info or help looking in the right direction would be greatly appreciated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like the menzenhauer company is the big name in zithers back then to be very similar models from that time period with the same patent date
whatisthisthing,not_removed,based on the eagle symbol at the top as well as the shape of the instrument this is a columbiaphonoharp chord zither identification page httpwwwpickawaypressfzczhtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mandolin harp httpwwwpickawaypressfzgizmohtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i looked more closely at the note sheet and it says patented may if that helps anyone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved holy shit thats amazing thank you

whatisthisthing,not_removed,animal nail trimmer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup animal nail trimmer the back plate is a guard to assist in not cutting off too much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks everyone i picked it up at the thrift store for cents when i saw oster i immediately thought of my old kitchen blender so i thought kitchen tool plus it was in a bin with kitchen utensils at goodwill now i can trim my yorkies nails without going too deep i knew i could count on my fellow redditors for answers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah my dog hates those
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mine saw the pic and ran
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i showed my dog and she bit me confirmed clippers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably rubber feet for something like a shelf or stand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have furniture with that color they look like plugs which would fillin behind a screw which holds together the furniture they dont look like ikea though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are not rubber they are plastic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,saw this the other day is a purse hanger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,weighs about grams the stuff inside the ring is made of some sort of plastic or acrylic and feels solid the metal ring is about the same diameter as a watch face the hinges wrap closed around the object with the end of the last hinge just barely completing a circle the piece of metal connecting the hinge to the rest of the ring can also extend outwards as shown in picture the black section in the middle has a geometric gemlike cut to it on one side and is flat on the other not magnetic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and they actually work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bingo nice find interesting that id never heard or seen of something like this before but it was considered common enough to be put in a cracker sold at a grocery store
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was bumfuddled when i first saw it then someone knew and i remembered which is amazing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here is one from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,guess youve never been on whatisthisthing ever damn purse hangers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont own a purse but found
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rockin that wonderful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like termite frass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,termite frass you can tell because termites have hexagon shaped buttholes which makes those little pieces of wood sided looks like a decent amount too call an exterminator asap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,repairing termite damage can run well into the thousands of dollars so get someone in there right away before it turns into tens of thousands
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen the source part move so i assume it could be a bug of some sorts maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe its a sensor for the collision warning system edit its a built in radar for the collision warning system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is where the vehicles is located it is used for adaptive cruise control
whatisthisthing,not_removed,presumably for better aerodynamics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oops my bad p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,assrest kinda like sitting but still standing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that picture is really dramatic with the scary chair sitting next to it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,resting spot especially for the elderly who find it hard to get up and down from a chair
whatisthisthing,not_removed,leaning bench
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the lightrail stations in my city have these not padded though bare metal probably aluminum you sorta rest your ass against it it allows you to take some weight off your feet but not completely less than half as satisfying as sitting down in my opinion a bummer if youve been on your feet all day and youre tired i guess they want to discourage loiterers or make it impossible for homeless people to sleep on them but it seems there are better ways of doing that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sitting for hipsters or is it intended for elderly who have trouble getting up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they did gave me a number and told me to got to the resting zone while i was the only customer thanks 👍
whatisthisthing,not_removed,high chairs are scary its for little kids
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah haha it reminds me of a hospital
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you dont want to see what was on the other side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they did gave me a number and told me to got to the resting zone while i was the only customer thanks 👍
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems like a complex and costy setup for what could be replaced by a simple edge or bench somebody must have had a bonus for convincing mcdonalds to install them in their locations
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the waiting zone if you could fully sit there it would always be occupied by people eating they have a lot of them at this new type where you order and get a number
whatisthisthing,not_removed,now i do this will bother me forever if i do not get to see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they did gave me a number and told me to got to the resting zone while i was the only customer thanks 👍
whatisthisthing,not_removed,terminals with touchscreens so you can order your food without ever speaking to another human being it begins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like blisters perhaps you were squeezing something too tight steering wheel maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive had tiny moles on my finger tips but smaller than that one day i got tired of them and used a foot file and managed to break down the top of them to reveal the root which i plucked with tweezers dont recommend doing it but it worked in my case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry we dont do medical on witt try raskdocs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably not have had them for the least year or so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow i guess that is solved thanks there are so many odd and interesting traditions connected to weddings interesting story behind this one and also makes a nice wedding souvenir i wonder if this particular cup was ever used i bought it at a junk shop for eight dollars just because it caught my eye the owner had no idea what it was for ive had it on my bookshelf for a couple of years now i finally know what it actually is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what are the things inside how tall is it whats uu
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we had something very similar for long matches next to our fireplace the strike pad was on the bottom it does look like theres been some striking on the bottom so maybe the strike pad wore off decades ago and its just be decorative since then is there a wood burning fireplace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you sure it is not a chopstick holder full of chopsticks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fatwood kindling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was she a weaver did she have a loom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pull some out and let us see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been a unitarian universalist for a while and ive never seen anything like this before that said some traditions vary regionally and we do make an effort to evolve with the times so this could still be related just not now or where i live
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the votive stands in churches often have a holder like this in them to hold sticks that you use to light candles from an alreadylit candle its either that or a chopstick holder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this has still not been solved i am quite certain they are chopsticks a bit longer than some sure but long chopsticks are fairly common too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,universal unitarianism
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is httpsiimgurcomnfzttsijpg of them i assume you are on mobile ive been seeing a lot of people missing the additional photos when they are on mobile
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thats the only meaning i know for uu but
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did your gran work with children sunday school girl scouts or school music teacher or maybe senior citizens activities these look like an older more sophisticated version of i can absolutely imagine a music teacher who perhaps went from classtoclass with a cart instead of having a dedicated room asking a handy husband to make this holder so the kids could pick updrop off their pairs they could also be batons for orchestra conductor practice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would suspect your brother is right but im more than done with looking at pictures of egg sacs to make sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would get rid of it regardless if its spider eggs or not but i would say your brother is correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly some sort of status indication for an air handler in the ceiling or on the roof
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i suspect that its a remote indicator for a ventmounted smoke detector located nearby just above the ceiling helps maintenance people identify a malfunctioning sensor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,saying that its in the vault room of a bank im going to say thats probably a bad idea lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,location is important
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pigweed

whatisthisthing,not_removed,in wisconsin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know that one but it isnt coming to me square stem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not pigweed it doesnt look like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the stem is round and ribbed not square
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwweedidwisceduweedidphp really wanted this to be pigweed but maybe you will get a different answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpimgurcomeewvnnf httpimgurcomcmbmlxm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i got a couple more pics if you are interested to me it almost looks like marijuana but it doesnt smell like it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess you have never actually seen marijuana then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know nothing about mac but just a shot in the dark here might it be steam downloading maybe another thing downloading an update
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nothing happens if you hover over it or click on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you use libreoffice if yes check
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes i do thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the end it really was an update but thank you for taking the time to help me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont have steam and itd be weird if it were an update because its been there for a couple of days now but thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope hover leftclick it rightclick it just static
whatisthisthing,not_removed,man okay something else you can try launch the activity monitor this will bring up a list of all the processes running on your mac and youll see that some of the processes have an icon next to them see if you can find this icon in that list failing that how far down the rabbit hole do you want to go if you have xcode installed or want to download and install it you can launch xcode and do xcode open developer tool accessibility inspector if you click on the thing that looks like a gunsight you can then hover over anything and the inspector will tell you what program it belongs to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also we are aware of the misspelling of espresso on the table of this rented accommodation and are suitably outraged worry not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre for prying so for pretty much anything you can think of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have similar scissors they are for prying the side of jar lids to release vacuum seals
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is the proper eyetalian spelling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its for getting the corn off the cob
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep corn cobber surprised it wasnt shown in use with the traditional nail through a board to hold the cob steady and upright otherwise they would be nearly impossible to use correctly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like mouse poison
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was going to say rat poison not sure why they would be in your seat and you not know about it unless this is a used car either way scrub your hands and clean out your car with a breather on be sure to use some sort of cleaning neutralizing agent just in case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,after parking in a chicago parking garage for several days so brought his camry home to the burbs i took it for an oil change a week or so later the tech showed me the cabin air filter which had rodentlike teeth marks i brought the car home and set a trap in it overnight next morning rat it freaks me like that we drive around with a rat in the car for nearly two weeks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heh looks almost like that r whatisthisthing only here suddenly everyone knows the answerweird
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rat poison
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mouse poison derkon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that was fast that must be exactly what it is i wonder why they were in the car seat did manufacturing do that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fortunately this specific type of mouse and rat poison does have a prescription antidote called vitamin overthecounter medications or food with high vitamin k content will not be sufficient substitutes most pets need to be treated with vitamin for days two days after the last dose of vitamin is administered a blood clotting test called a prothrombin pt should be checked to make sure the clotting is normal otherwise your pet can still potentially bleed out despite one month of therapy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mice and other rodents often will carry food and hide it places to eat later often while doing renovation work ive seen small piles of rodent poison in walls and ceilings its not too much of a stretch to think a mouse made a nest in some of the batting or foam that the seats are made of and stored some poison to eat or like my friends car that had a squirrel that made a nest in his glovebox
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youve got rodents nesting in your seat cushions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont know the background of the car maybe previous owner or someone had issues with mice maybe someone spilled a container of it maybe the mice brought them back to where they lived in the seats and died
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agree they look like mouse poison but i found something that i thought was that in some upholstery once then realized they were the plugs from punching vent holes in the top foam layer mouse poison is hard unless damp then it kind of falls to dustgoo depending on how damp foam is foam and pops back to shape probably poison but if they are foam they are benign manufacturing leftovers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they might keep some with the textiles to prevent mice from moving in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everyone should keep a squirrel in their glove compartment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh god imagine driving on the freeway and then having rats coming out of your seat and crawling all over you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uh you dont put toxic bait somewhere you want animals to avoid you put it where they are so they die
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he tells an amazing story about how he found out there was a squirrel living in there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i keep alert lerts need a home also
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and a theftdeterrent monkey in the trunk member trunk monkey
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no one needed that picture in their head
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you also dont put toxic poison in a car that will be used to transport animals dumb people and small children
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe with that type of poison it makes the mice super thirsty and they leave their dwelling to find water and thus they die on the outside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there may have been a mouse problem requiring the use of poison
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i opened my glovebox and there it was story
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats a left
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i called mine chim chim
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was a marketing myth so people would buy the stuff thinking the mice wouldnt die inside walls they do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an anticoagulant they literally die from internal hemorrhaging
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because thats the only conceivable use of rat poison you dont generally use it for seasoning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was at the edge of my seat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think i ate his chocolate squirrel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he was at a dwi check point coming home from working at a bar and he popped it open to graphics his registration and it made the squirrel leap out and tear ass around his car he panicked and jumped out with his car in gear state troopers thought he was running from the checkpoint and drew weapons he tried to tell the troopers a squirrel was in the car but he got slammed into a car hood during the subsequent search of his car they found a bunch of chewed up papers and plant material in the glove box where the squirrel nested troopers started laughing and then apologized one told a story about how he did something similar with a bee that flew in the window tldr he tells it much better
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my family are suckers for marketing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,marketing myth aka false advertising
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the passenger seat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,god i wish we had dashcam video of that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,graphics his registration what
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he pretty much acts it out but yeah a dash cam would be a youtube goldmine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my friend looks more like a balding timmy than a trevor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i told you he tells it better
whatisthisthing,not_removed,old surveying transit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it have angular measurements on it it definitely looks like surveying equipment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks to me like a horizontal microscope circa i doubt that its a surveying transit because of the linear gear which would be used to move the cylinder forwards and backwards which you wouldnt need on a transit on a microscope that would help adjust focus typically survey transits from that era have large wheels on the trunnion axis and big lenses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an early style dumpy level
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say its a telescopic alidade
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it have a tripod mount or does it sit on a table if the latter it may be part of an old spectroscope
whatisthisthing,not_removed,deleted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you use it sideways
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like delft pottery aka httpsenwikipediaorgwikidelftware
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep generic delft or delft style vase whether it was made in delft depends on signature
whatisthisthing,not_removed,something similar was posted before and the common consensus was that it as bag hanger

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know which is more amazing that reddit knew the answer so fast or that there is a company that specializes is just cup holders
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was going to reply and noticed your link was where i answered it before
whatisthisthing,not_removed,welp hoping umhyquel will mark as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its aftermarket so it really could be anything i have a switch i added that disables the seat heaters because the actual switches on the center console get knocked and turned on all the time if i dont tell the next owner hell never figure it out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,see if the brake lights work when its off it definitely doesnt look like its from the factory people add toggles to deactivate brake lights so if you see a cop and slow down they dont see the lights
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does your stereo have an aux input i installed an aftermarket fmmodulator aux input in my wifes grand am and added a toggle switch for its power in a similar fashion im going to guess its something like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does the car start with the switch turned off i run a paint shop and commonly encounter cars with kill switches for antitheft purposes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does the car have remote start usually aftermarket systems have a switch to disable the remote start during service
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have one more use for a switch like that to add a switch like that is popular to install to bypass the parking brake requirement on indash dvd players so they can play while the car is moving illegal but very common
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doesnt seem to do anything obvious when i flipped it on and off no mention of it on google that i saw and nothing in the owners manual either is this a normal thing or some random custom thing a previous owner put in tia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah aftermarket for sure i have two switches right there one for extra backup lights and one for my light bar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well that seems unsafe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomgfvedzegif
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an old buddy did this to his ricer in high school i didnt realize its that common til
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you know what else they cant see down shifting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,given the location being an easy foot toggle when coming off the throttle this was my first guess too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah brake lights still worked thx tho
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had an aftermarket fm tuner aux input that had a switch like this op check your glove box for any electrical devices in there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill have to test that later it is an aftermarket stereo and the aux does work with stuff like my phone i havent tested it with the phone plugged in to see if it disables it i dont see anywhere a large crossover or amp would be though so idk ill check that though thx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,been planning on doing this for a while as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah that was the first thing i checked at least that would be useful although its in a very obvious spot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nothing that fancy installed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely illegal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the one i mounted in my wifes car i stuck right behind the console where ops switch is so look there too in my trailblazer i mounted just inside the inboard side of the glove box so youd have to swing the glove box fully down to get to it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nothing in the glovebox
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a homebrew and its too old to be worth anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my friend had a computer like this back in tha day an old with a turbo button as if you needed a computer to go slower
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not mine so i dont have really any information on it the only thing i do know is that the motherboard in it is a sorry for the crappy picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with no model sticker it will be a diy job with a and drive it dates to the which places it as either a pentium or just possibly a pentium or athlon edit actually the cd drive indicates the later half
whatisthisthing,not_removed,case for is that im not sure if turbo buttons were often on and there were few things on a cd that you could play on and those old floppies were pretty useless for case for is basically same thing floppy drive coulda been just because old machine left tons of floppies someone wanted to still use and were the point where cds got popular sure as hell theres nothing that requires a cd and can play on especially games and tower cases became standard at about era before and during that case was flat and went under monitor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i really forgot how useful a hardware lock on the pc was that could save me a ton of headaches around the kiddo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a custom build of some sort extremely old probably from about or so its probably going to be running windows on top of msdos it was probably an extremely expensive system at the time cd rom and a couple of floppy drives the hot swap hard drive tray on top is a nice touch it may have been used as a server for a company for awhile now its trash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,obsolete
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually old pcs are popular with people playing classic pc video games and if its a good motherboardprocessor set it can be worth a bit just a quick search on ebay sold listings shows that thats probably at least worth if its a ish pc but from when i was putting those together in the cd rom drives didnt exist a drive was still kind of expensive and something like a or might have been available but i cant remember but someone might have added a later cdrom drive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well yes you did if you had a game or software that was written for a it would run too fast on a or it would be unplayable so you would use the turbo button to turn down the clock speed on the processor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what the motherboard is will supply more info than a photo of the exterior since the case is a generic at tower case a quick gander says it is a socket board which is firstsecond generation pentium and the last generation socket which was compatible with intel and amd cpus it is from around to or so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and those old floppies were pretty useless for homebrewers for that era would just reuse casepsfloppies from earlier models hell my mobo might be years old but it still has a floppy drive cable port built in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the drive tray isnt hotswap ive got the same model removable drive tray on my computer it just holds a standard httpsenwikipediaorgwikiparallelata harddrive thats why it has the lock on it to prevent you from accidentally pulling it out while the computer is running the reason ive kept hold of mine is that i took it apart years ago and turned it into a draw for storing usb sticks and other stuff it comes in handy ive even got the green led hooked up to power so it actually looks like its still a functioning drive bay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there was never a point in time when i had a computer with both and cdrom a the same time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool the turbo button was always a mystery to me thanks for the info i never owned a computer until exceptfor a coco but all my other friends had computers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lots of people had data on floppies that they needed access to even in the era of cdroms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i used to always put them in i had them from old computers and the drive bay was there and the cable had the connector so why not who knows when youd want to play that old copy of kings quest iv
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the first pc with a cd drive my family got had a oldie though it was a packard bell

whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was quick thanks man
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a lot more innocent than i would have expected for an item that looks like it could have weapon potential found in a bar lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not op here youll probably think im being that guy but im not convinced thats what it is because the handle is pointed the wrong way the notches at the top in the photo wouldnt provide as much leverage and the handle would be pushed toward the top of the lid limiting motion instead of pulled away from the side whats with the sdm and ag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone was probably using it as a bottle opener or maybe it fell out of their pocket

whatisthisthing,not_removed,what the hell i didnt think my dad was in scouts but i didnt know much about him either thanks for the answer solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ukrainian colors it looks like a commemoration medal more than a military medal i think its a boy scout medal i think i can find a picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a cub scout rocketry medal and it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my father served in the us army during the vietnam war era but was stationed in germany he worked at our local federal building downtown doing maintenance and custodial work for nearly years before dying in this weekend my brother and i were sorting through a box of his things i remember he received some sort of award at work for outstanding performance but dont know if this is related or separate the back part of the medal is smooth with no markings or text anywhere i remember seeing it briefly in his toolbox when i was younger but with no text or other markings i cant identify it my mom has no idea where its from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,turns out it was a boy scout medal but i wonder why you immediately jumped to ukrainian colors instead of eg swedish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been to ukraine a few years ago so im already predisposed to thinking about that country and the flag is in stripes like that ribbon sweden is arranged in a cross
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks note that the cross is only used in the flag if the colors are used in other contexts they may very well be arranged differently for instance a swedish pennant used on flagpoles when the flag isnt raised looks like this httpssvwikipediaorgwikivimpel swedish medals will often use the colors arranged differently according to the medal that being said i would probably also have guessed ukraine before sweden simply because of the affinity towards medals civilian and military in the former ussr countries
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i really just put that there as a marker as my initial thought of where to look next most countries use multicoloured ribbons but use the national colours for specific medals these usually have a national symbol as well and the rockets didnt match that then i searched for yellow and blue ribbon and bound the boy scout medal

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it sounds sort of like a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly but ive never heard it before today it also never stays on for more than about seconds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be a mocking bird mocking an alarm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its very likely that someone near you is getting an alarm system upgraded serviced i own an alarm company sometimes when were working on them we set them off numerous times we dont like the sirens blaring for long because we know they annoy the neighbors and its also loud to us so we set them off then put in the user code to shut them up quickly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the chainsaw was spot on and the camera shutter too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i was going good to say the sound is not anywhere near consistent enough to be an actual alarm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its essentially an electronic steel drum httpswwwalternatemodecompankatshtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,better start saving for the next years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just learn the recorder much more affordable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an electric buzzer uses a similar mechanism to an interrupter bell but without the resonant bell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be an old style doorbell type device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a buzzer to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ukylefrances please mark the post solved httpwwwredditcomrwhatisthisthingwikimarkapostnocss if you have any bother doing so reply to me and ill mark the post solved for you also please do not delete your post as other people might find it useful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is an electric buzzer basically just the solenoid part of a bell ringer without the striker and gong i have a few electric bells that look exactly the same as this with the cover off attached to the moving part would be the striker with the bell mounted to the housing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think the transformer would have two separate sets of windings like that i think this is the buzzer itself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is correct pictured is just the buzzer the transformer is usually located in a basement or attic as they fail every so often and need to be replaced
whatisthisthing,not_removed,phone stand and a like sound amplifier thing put the phone speaker holes over the hole in the bottom of this and it acts like a thing to make it more loud
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i work at a popular convenience store chain these were given to us by a pepsi rep a few months back to give out to customers cant figure out what they are supposed to be or do other than hold keys the green part is a hard plastic the black is a soft rubber the hole starts wide and gets more narrow as it nears the end with the keyring attached but it curves rather than being straight i took it apart in one of the pictures to demonstrate this but its otherwise glued together so its not supposed to come apart i cant get it to whistle or make noise i cant imagine how anyone would use it to open a can or bottle its design totally baffles me and everyone ive shown it to irl please help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here we go with a product shot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wouldnt it tip over it being round and all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah it acts as like a kick stand phone on the side like horizontal and this going backwards heres a quick drawing to kinda explain better
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think might be right it would work well as a phone stand for watching movies except the keychain part kind of gets in the way worse if you actually have keys on it i imagine is a picture of it holding up a notebook my phone is my camera so i cant take a picture of it holding up my phone the sound part might be iphone specific maybe it doesnt align with the speaker on my samsung at all and even if it did wouldnt it be directing the sound away from me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess that makes this a kickstart kickstand it seems so obvious now thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes they are right you have it turned backwards in your photo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there we go that makes way more sense thank you also username definitely doesnt check out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a kind of sword that not much is certainly known about they used to be be attributed to the berber regions of north africa and they are still called berber swords but the majority opinion seems to be that they originated in the dominican republic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think its a machete the blade style has a japanese short sword wakizashi feel to it but the handle is wrong for it to be one and the tip isnt quite right for a traditional japanese style the handle make me think it might be from the phillippines or indonesia ill see if i can find out some more
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for looking into this for me guy having no luck myself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you read my response
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an ox bow pin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it could be an old sweep wheel removal tool for watchmakers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a device to find the center point on a table leg or round stock could also be used for boring a hole on a lathe maybe

whatisthisthing,not_removed,based on the characters and the year described i would say its from the early chinese communist military could be wrong though source just spent a month in china
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just dont wear it or youll get the youtube stolen valor guys all over your ass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i took japanese for years this is defenitely chinese
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,quick note it actually says 中原 not 中國 which is interesting in itself since both terms differ slightly the former being a more historicalcultural concept while the latter insinuates the state
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could you tell us what the characters say
whatisthisthing,not_removed,upvote this man i totally didnt catch that cheers for the correction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no problem whatsoever would also like to point out that the characters are in traditional chinese script which would be helpful in dating it since the peoples republic uses simplified characters nowadays id hazard a guess and say it was made at least before so its pretty much contemporary with the event itself heres the text itself in traditional characters should you ever feel a need to compare them p 淮海戰役 勝利紀念 中國人民解放軍
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have almost no idea the bottom set of characters are the same as the top line on the back the first characters look like they just say chinese my apologies for not knowing more their language is extremely complicated when english is your first language ps ill see if i can get more info when i finally get home im currently in canada because my flight home got cancelled yesterday

whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure thats relief valve to prevent a vacuum in the fuel tank
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this seems like it and indeed as op suspected is a pressure regulator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know the significance as in i dont know if that style buddha represents anything specific but i had a necklace with the same carving years ago the hole is where the pin for the jump ring to attach the pendant to the necklace was mine broke in the same way its an easy enough repair i gave mine away to a frenemy oh high school because i had bad luck every time i wore it dont worry though its definitely not the one i had mine was a darker green edit for spelling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a pendant the hole allows a silk string to be passed through an knotted the three lines might be the numeral possibly a reference to some category or quality in the place it was made
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my votes on pendant as well it looks pendantic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a piece of a dog training collar the triangular part goes against the dogs skin similar to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,large dog control collar im guessing the right two sections have been clipped on backwards edit found it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so the other day this showed up in our waiting room and nobody knows knows what it is east coast usa is location there are no real markings on it except of the links have and have each piece can snap on and off but not easily and it doesnt seem to do anything special my first guess was an incomplete part of a toy but it doesnt seem to do anything special doesnt feel especially cheap or poorly made edit no banana around so i used a notecard for size reference
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can the two pieces on the right detach be turned over and be reconnected such that then all pieces face the same way points up seems like it should do that and then it would make sense in my brain and if it does then it seems like this is a piece of a larger chainbelt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you guys are good the flipped setup had me fooled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved yeah the orientation of the pieces and the build quality threw me off i wouldnt trust this on a big dog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh damn i thought that was a piece of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they can and as the other poster found you are basically correct its a behavior collar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oil lamp and grail are symbols sometimes associated with the knights templar also the cross sun and laurel wreath seems consistent with that or another christian society
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you know where he went to school did he teach in any capacity light knowledge lit oil lamp learning i think its an hourglass not wine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an pin a lamp of knowledge plus a winners circlet of laurel leaves plus a wine goblet was your grandfather a vintner or sommelier did he take a vacation to france or napa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably a nursing pin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reminds me of the hanukkah myth that after a military victory an oil lamp burned for days even though it only had enough oil for one day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmmm i will refine my googling a bit thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i honestly dont know too much about him i only met him a few times when i was very young my family is pretty small and spread out and he and my mother never had a very good relationship i do know that he was fairly high ranking career marine lost his leg sometime during the vietnam war and was later stationed in brazil for a number of years in the early
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh that looks pretty similar the laurels definitely make it look like an achievement of some sort as for having some relation to wine i wouldnt assume to know the man very well but he was essentially a john waynetype character and took his whiskey very seriously
whatisthisthing,not_removed,highly doubt it theres no jewish imagery anywhere on the object and that isnt really something that would usually be made into a pin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nursing was going to be my suggestion too this article says that along with the lamp other religious symbols such as the chalice here are common on nursing pins httpsenwikipediaorgwikinursingpin the blood drop could imply nursingmedicine too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh i do see it as a wine glass now i originally thought it looked like an hourglass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is an hourglass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the lamp of knowledge and a running hourglass surrounded by laurels on a sunburst im drawing a blank the lamp is usually associated with academia the hourglass with the fleeting nature of time and of life the laurels suggest its an award
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a person hugging a sitting person from behind other than that i have no idea what youre asking about sorry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i suppose the artist could have been inspired by socrates teachings on virtue and the importance of friendships and community over stuff like material wealth but i think truthfully its mostly its just a kitchy tourist trinket

whatisthisthing,not_removed,my roommate figured it out its michigans upper peninsula
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if youre not from the us or canada not knowing that shape is acceptable if you are then wow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im from wisconsin haha woops i guess id just never seen a map of the up separated from the rest of michigan so it wasnt obvious to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry for the fuzzy image it buzzed quickly from flower to flower with a low pitched humbuzz it had a thick bendy probe thing as its mouth to collect nectar and a black and white fuzzy stripey bum its body was a brown but i could not describe its wings due to them buzzing so fast the whole animalinsect looked about thick our guesses were either a strange hornet or hummingbird any guesses would be appriciated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a hummingbird moth httpsenwikipediaorgwikihummingbirdhawkmoth theyre super cool we have a similar species in my area really neat to watch them buzz about
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry we dont do insects here in witt try rwhatsthisbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some species of bee hawk moth probably either httpsenwikipediaorgwikihemaristityus or httpsenwikipediaorgwikihemarisfuciformis
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a printers mark its like a very old school logo they showed up around the century they were used to identify the printerpublisher and generally used a motif of cross orb christianity and earth slight stylistic differences and initials identified the specific printer google image search printers mark orb and cross for lots of examples
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it seems to be a variant of httpwwwschrijversystemcomdamptreatment which claims to divert airflow along the wall in such a way as to reduce damp in the wall
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how high off the ground is it looks like a crawlspace vent to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you get a widerangle photo that looks like it may be at ground level
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinda looks like a cleat of some sort anything near by need anchoring down or wrapped up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think we can call that solved sorry it took me so long to get back i didnt get any notifications
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if thats a vent it looks like an invitation to leakage and critters to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed id assumed there was wire mesh or similar on the inside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought was a fire piston httpsenwikipediaorgwikifirepiston
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i may have a lead i was browsing vintage kitchenalia and came across a vintage piping tube with a wooden plunger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my late grandfathers museum in rural manitoba is being shut down and it contents being distributed to other museums and collections and during the process weve come across a few items that were uncatalogued and had us scratching our heads items in the museum are generally from the mid to early im not sure whereabouts in the museum this item was found the middle cylinder is solid hardwood possibly maple with holes for the pegs drilled in each end one peg is painted red the other appears to have the remains of blue paint on it and i would guess it is missing the handle portion the red peg has the pegs are frictionfit into the central cylinder and are fairly easy to remove however i cant guarantee that they are supposed to come out at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a rolling pin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a good thought but the end holes do not go all the way through the middle cylinder and theres no signs of scorching that youd expect on a filestarting device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it definitely has the shape of one but its very small for a rolling pin and the handle shape makes it quite awkward to roll that said its possible its a handmade toy rolling pin for a child
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt expect the hole to go right through for a fire piston generally with a few millimeters deeper than the rod double ender perhaps without context its going to be a tricky one to pin down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i really wish i could provide more background but this one is a bit of a mystery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres some real hound dog detectives here give it time someone will narrow it down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say that is one of the three wise men
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i see a g on his hat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all i can say is its a mens cameo ring although not technically cameo because its gold and not a gem they were made in a great variety and arent exactly common
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry that the picture is a little on the blurry side the ring is with a cousin on the other half of the country now so i cant really get any other pics if it helps my grandfather is from italian decent born in italy moved to the east coast went back to italy with the army in the came back to rhode islandmassachussetts and then las vegas for the last years of his life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look for a stamp inside the band then take a clear picture of it that would help a bunch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so from what i can find its a double roman mens cameo ring if you google this youll find a lot of very similar looking rings but not identical i cant find the significance of the double faces except that it was a common motif on some roman coins or jewelry it could be mars and venus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it was gold it would be stamped its probably not a valuable ring other than the sentimental value it may hold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what exactly is a cameo ring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think this is likely a replica of a similar ring not that its identical but maybe close enough to help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there wasnt one in there memory says sure just the head of a little crew holding the piece of black plastic to the metal band
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gotcha yeah were not looking to sell it just trying to figure out where it came from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cameo is a plastic art carving made onin gem in this case referring to the profile of a personpeople this motive exists as carved gem you probably know this as a famous person in a movie this is because the roots of the word are roughly outstanding like a plastic art carving or someone famous in a place you wouldnt expect him
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hm doesnt say too much about the origin of the ring but that opens some info up thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,made in great variety and quantity is about right theres tonnes of companies including hundreds on the east coast of the united states that made them alone nothing we can really say without any marks on the band since theres no real defining characteristics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup looks like a chinese magic mirror to me httpsenmwikipediaorgwikichinesemagicmirror
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from the angle it looks to be a or proprietary usb connector for digital cameras but without more information that could be completely wrong so i would call it a stupid useless piece of crap i hate companies who use non standard connectors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought is type d micro hdmi maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it could be a mini displayport but im not surewhats the other side look like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed i had a similar port on an old fuji digital camera
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am staying in china for a couple months this lady has a mask that looks better than the others ive seen the arm mounted device probably offers more protection does anyone know where i can get one i couldnt find anything on google
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you want actual protection get a mask that is actually a rated respirator a simple paper filter like this will remove the larger particles but miss the fine ones which are the ones that are the most dangerous it also wont seal tightly to your face like silicone will its still better than nothing but a real respirator that seals to your face properly and will actually block particles smaller than microns is far better additionally you can get combo filters which are rated for organic vapors particles and those filter out all the smells as well whether chemical or human if you want something that seals well but has replaceable filters like this and packs small check out the httptotobobocom mask its only but will seal far better than a cloth mask that has a big hose hanging off it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a spoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fancy drug spoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,like for cocktails
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah but its way smaller you could maybe fit a raisin on there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought so too at first but its really small you mean like for cocaine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rwhatsthisbug

whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks uslippingabout for finding that it is an old umbrella handle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very ornate and has some initials on the top of the door knob looking part the narrow end is not sharp and does not spin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it has a wire running through it looks like part of a lamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like part of a lamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reminds me of a very ornate propelling pencil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like the lamp idea maybe its an old candlestick that got made into a lamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think its a lamp the small end is not a wire its metal here is the pic of the top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dang i think this might be it i wonder what happened to the umbrella part would explain the metal part edit after looking at more pics this has got to be it the metal knife must me the retaining latch for the umbrella
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the wire thing is actually a solid metal knife looking thing its not sharp however the top of this is rounded like a door knob
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i added a picture of what i think people are calling the base of a lamp its actually rounded like a door knob and has initials on it almost more like part of a cane but much too short and has the metal knife looking thing at bottom i think there might be another part missing that covers the narrow end
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it could be an old fire box
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it a collage area when ive lived near collages they had these pretty frequently often refereed to as rape poles but were for any type of emergency phone box with a light over it and an alarm that could be sounded
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep or if near an old school possibly a crosswalk that a crossing guard could only access
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks again always wondered what this was double checked with some older residents and they said they were emergency call boxes for fires or other emergencies thanks again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome and if a cross walk how did it work just something to hold the sign
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well im thinking there would be a light on that overhead thing that lit up when the crossing guard flipped a switch before crossing the streetor perhaps there were overhead redlights there at one time my old grade school had a control box that the crossing guard could access it was at a red light he would push a button to turn the light red then push it again for green after he helped us across
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe this says souvenir but the middle portion of the s and part of the o are missing the word is fairly common on antique needlepoints and samplers hopefully my overtrace makes it slightly more legible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thanks i suggested that wife did not agree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can we see a full picture of the object really curious as to what the rest looks like now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so based on an episode of antiques roadshow i saw i know that young women would create these types of textiles to practice their needlepoint stitches lettering etc it really doesnt look like any specific word based on the letters above im guessing just a type of stitch she was trying to perfect hence the term sampler editing to add wikipedia page that gives more history httpsenmwikipediaorgwikisamplerneedlework
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes id go with souvenir too

whatisthisthing,not_removed,the circle thingy kinda looks like the base of a microscope
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe thats a european electrical plug adapters are available to plug it into an american outlet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like various kinds of illumination stages for a microscope
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i forgot to mention that the plug is not an european plug at least not the one used in portugal it has smaller pins closer together and didnt fit anywhere i added an httpimgurcomrqeaqwi of it next to a normal one also i took a picture of the probably just a storage code but could be helpful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it has a weird plug youre adorable d
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youre on to something there cheap microscopes use mirrors to reflect ambient light back up into slides this could be a base that a cheap microscope slots into for use with thick slides
whatisthisthing,not_removed,american outlets are volts europe uses volts it may work with an adapter or it may be very dim
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes thats an httpsenwikipediaorgwikieuroplug thats common in most countries in europe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the plug also looks like it hooks up into some kind of wall plug adapter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it looks like the base of a reflecting microscope the light would shine on the mirror and you could tilt the mirror to reflect up through your slide looks like youre missing the lens and slide holder aka the top i cant figure out those paddles though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i suspect they are simple arm rests if this is an accessories pack for a microscope then its quite possible arm rests would be included although they dont look very comfortable httpcdnllmarketlabcomimagesxxlmicroscopearmrestjpg

whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha thats awesome thank you solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cant tell you much about it looking at it its most likely bakelite but try rvintageradios maybe they can help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my dad would like to know would have been relatively new at the time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it looks like bakelite you could post this here for more help httpantiqueradioscomforumsindexphp oh i like that candlestick phone too it looks like a western electric it looks to be a set needing a subsetringer box since i dont see a rotary dial on it radio is most likely a standard or tube superheterodyne hot chassis acdc set i dont know who made it though

whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you tried a flashlight to project on the wall to see what the images are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no they are actually my moms she posted picture on facebook asking if anyone knows what they are im at my house and i know shes asleep by now so i figured id take her pic and post it here if someone doesnt figure it out tonight ill have her try the flashlight tomorrow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved

whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool thats what it is marking post solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was quite easy actually i took a snippet from your picture and put it on photoshop cleaned up the image so it was more tidy and then did google image search drag and drop and i managed to find the logo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well im glad you were willing to do the dirty work for me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks dead wait a few days to see if it falls off on its own
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry we dont permit medical questions here on witt try asking on raskdocs good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that appears to be a hematoma under the nail theres been an injury and blood has collected under the nail usually this results in the nail falling off and having to regrow this can be prevented by drilling a small hole through the nail however in this case i would recommend against it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,battery electronics and a magnetic pickup coil looks dodgy to me looks like the new shim style that has been flooding victoria and wa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a skimmer or reader of some sorts looks rfidchip based not reading the magnetic strip not on that but yeah its a skimmer let the cops know if you want ultimately wont do much other than put it out of circulation and maybe have them send an officer to the location to check the other readers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is in the uk you arent able to put a card in the slot while this was in so i assume it downloads information onto it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,has been handed in to our main office it will be passed on to the police in the morning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was probably for different type of reader and the skimmer criminal tried to use it in the wrong type or got interrupted while installing it that is defiantly a skimmer call the police and let them know where it was found
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was probably designed to skim when someone uses the chip reader though looks like it was assembled in high school shop class the successful ones typically are not noticeable and use the secure chip slot to intercept the data my guess is the coil detects the data reading and usually should skim without direct contact so basically this is a crappy knockoff of a new style skimmer id watch for people trying to access that slot if you have access to it someone would likely be by in a few days to collect the data andor the device as it doesnt look sophisticated enough or powered well enough to transmit wirelessly edit i noticed a lot of smears in the adhesive on the metal perhaps someone was careless and left fingerprints here is the article i saw the shims i mentioned earlier
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are no contacts for an chip and the picture op posted of the underside of the skimmer shows two copper wires running to what seems to be a pickup coil these skimmers are designed to store the magnetic stripe data in a flash memory the magnetic stripe data on its own is seldom useful since most retail and online stores now resort to either chippin or cc cve digit verification code so id say ubowsereatspeaches check the atm this was found in for any hidden cameras or a pin pad overlay because the typical implementation of a cc magstripe skimmer also includes some way of capturing the cards pin with this info cc stripe data pin they can clone the magnetic card head to an atm and extract as much money as the account and the issuer bank will allow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,excellent post thank you i was under the impression they couldnt skim the chip card ill be passing the info around
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not to defend a thief but electrinics are hard and the electronics look semi skillful not professional for sure but better than a hobbyist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,skimming a chip wouldnt be useful they use sharedkey cryptography
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this was a credit card reader on payment machine not an atm luckily it had only been on the machine around minutes and after realising what it was i checked everything else nothing was found bar the device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont deny that im saying they took a prefab cheapo chip likely ordered online and tried to make it work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try raskdocs if youre looking to find out what thats called
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its called a flange
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would be the socket of a ball and socket exhaust connection httpswwwsummitracingcomsearchparttypeexhaustballflangekits left from there is a heat shield
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that there is a muffler bearing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youre right

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this guy can help you with your blinker fluid levels
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i googled exhaust flange and it sure look similar sympathies if youre doing exhaust pipe work on an old crudded up system been there in a minnesota winter in a frozen gravel driveway its good not to be that poor again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with a quick search it looks like the factory system is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think im good i already have the radiator cap from a beetle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its apparently a ball and socket exhaust connection the piece im interested in is the female part
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks man ill ask the guys down at oreillys tomorrow just to make sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you need to go on antiques roadshow and find out how much that things worth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all you need to do is replace the missing bolts and washers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im straight piping it out of the side not reattaching it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the larger one is a drum machine the smaller one i couldnt identify but its some type of synthesizersampler as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uthepopplespopple is correct about the the other machine looks like a heavily modded roland tb possibly a httpimgurcomvrpiqni but need a more detailed pic to confirm edit link to devil fish mod image from robins website

whatisthisthing,not_removed,please mark as solved by using the flair at the top of the page or just commenting solved

whatisthisthing,not_removed,why didnt you just ask her and show here some support of what shes dealing with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are packaged like surgical scalpel blades since they are upper and lower they may be some kind of replaceable scissor blades similar to what they sell at some hardware stores to cut heavy hoses possible drug use for them they should work a razor blade though they look to be longer chopping up cocaine or heroine powder full disclosure all my drug knowledge comes from tv and movies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre know as wraps the strips are those thin clear things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jesus guys youre not supposed to downvote incorrect guesses just refute them and vote up right answers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a japanese noh mask made with horse hair and teeth edit the teeth are probably made of carved bone rather than horse teeth edit the wood is almost certainly japanese cypress based on tradition if anyones interested id guess its from the late based on the aging of the paint compared to similar masks at the burke museum of natural history in seattle httpsenmwikipediaorgwikinoh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wish i could tell you but damn can we please have a close up on those teeth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,somehow im thinking this is japanese
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank tou very much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here is a close up of the teeth httpsimgurcomaijvxv
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it certainly looks like a noh mask but china has a lot of related theatrical traditions we need someone with more expertise than i have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was your grandpa in wwii perhaps its strange that this would end up in his hands otherwise because they are very treasured and protected by old noh families id question whether it was kind of a spoils of war thing because its obviously quite old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you that is awesome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and than i have as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in fact he was in wwii he fought primarily in europe though he was in the infantry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should take this to a museum its more than likely over years old and deserving of proper preservation in a climate controlled environment now that its out of wherever your grandpa was storing it its in serious danger of deterioration until then get a large box that will keep it out of the light preferably padded and keep it off the floor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for your input hopefully i will also be able to learn more about this specific piece as a result of bringing it to a museum or expert towards these things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,call your local history or art museum and ask them to recommend an appraiser museums cant let their staff do it because it would constitute a conflict of interest but they will be able to point you in the right direction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id still take it to the museum before the appraiser for preservation a private appraiser would be able to go to the museum to see it anyway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i work at a museum and i assure you we dont want you bringing in art work without prior arrangements its a registration issue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did i ever say dont call just come on in without an invitation and insist you speak to the a research team
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know if you get what im saying what im saying is that when we have an object come into the building that is part of the acquisitions process and theres a lot of legal issues that have to do with it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all of which im sure op will find out more about when he calls his museum
whatisthisthing,not_removed,

whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right using the link you provided i decoded it a couple of the characters arent alphabet characters so i assume they were for space and full stop or exclamation maybe i put them in as anyway it says lookthroughthemirror edit haha i see beat me to it

whatisthisthing,not_removed,apparently it is a real car its like the pimp car and now looking inside i want one lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sort of like a kit car except fully assembled they used fieros and foxbodies but made classic designs on them and sold them neat idea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,zimmer golden spirit is an actual production car turns out its a neoclassic car with twist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,isnt a dusenburg the car that gatsby drives
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was a corvette indeed which caught my eye as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did she have a coat made of dalmatian fur
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually it makes a new definition of pig ugly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes indeed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sauce whisk i have seen my mother use it to make powder gravy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup this one is specifically from ikea i have a similar one and i use it for everything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,strange i never bought this its one of those strange things that turn up in your kitchen solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,balinese barong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought was kali
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am trying to identify what deity this depicts an evaulator said this i think i can safely say this is not a true antique but i admit i am struggling to come up with a definite country of origin i did to begin with think this might be tibetan on account of the various adornments the figure is wearing but on reflection this seems closer to kali in the indian sculpture tradition the pose is particularly reminiscent of early indian sculpture in bronze stone can anyone tell me what or who this is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm you think the antirangda barong is not usually depicted with a human body edit at least we agree on indonesian
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i too thought it looked very much like the pose of an indian statue but ive never seen kali depicted with a lions head mane face ill continue my research around that area maybe ill find a solution thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not saying youre wrong added
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rangda is supposedly a female though and this appears to me to be a male
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah the head looks indonesian edit perhaps rangda
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youve checked under the skirt then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gold salts used to be used in antiarthritis medications so possibly this was the raw material that was meant to be put into pill form but it could just as likely be a gold pigment of some kind as i believe chemists used to stock all sorts of nonmedicinal materials
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know you cant really see but the glass bottle is full of a golden powder the bottle is so old that the top is jammed on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is likely gold and you could try to trace the company if it exists and call them if that doesnt go anywhere it is also possible to contact a gold buyer who can verify the identity with a xrf gun you can try to remove the top with a heat gun the joint will heat and expand but the plug stays cool but its probably not easy to do that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like that digit telephone number i am and still use western electric model rotary phones and people think it was so hard to use a rotary phonewell when the numbers were digits it was easy and fast now with touchtone dialing it is faster to dial a digit number on a touchtone dial than a rotary

whatisthisthing,not_removed,havent a clue how to use it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,x inches i tried to look up the patent but cant find it the little slotted area is wood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill be damned ill mark this as solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is it awesome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems to be thanks for the help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i run the prehistoria natural history centre in toronto and we have an evergrowing collection of specimens it is hard to give a definitive answer but it would appear to be a heavily desertworn ushabti though this was an innocentintentioned instance of rock collecting id like to remind everyone that the removal of local antiquities is highly illegal in many countries especially in egypt if you ever come across an important natural or ancient artifact in the wild it is usually advised that you leave it in place but take photographs record the location as precisely as possible and report the discovery to the locations administration or a local academic institution the location and setting in which an object is found actually can provide far more data than the artifact itself obviously there are exceptions to any rule especially if the item faces immediate destruction in its current location but these tips will come in handy if you want to make the biggest possible benefit to our understanding of the world
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a worn down top half of a grave idol that the ancient egyptians used to make to bury besides the sarcophagus of a deceased loved one they were meant to serve the deceased in the afterlife as servants however this is just a guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just to add a bit more context to it it was buried about down in between one of the car parks and the valley of the kings its quite light and definitely not metal from the texture and weight
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any guess on the material is it stone pottery plastic or bone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the pictures righthand side it looks like the edge is broken off and the inside is exposed can you speculate what its made of it reminds me of the way chunks of flint are rough and pitted on the outside but glassy inside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be a playing piece for the game senet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved from whats been said an ushabti seems to be very similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it metal could it be a bullet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so what youre trying to say is httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvabutrbusu
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i went to egypt for a holiday nice place n all but i wasnt allowed to take home some pretty sea shells what i found while scuba diving guy on the bus told us to leave everything on the bus which we picked up rocks shells anything told we could get big trouble
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think this is the right answer i recently took a trip to the nelsonatkins museum of art and they had an egyptian exhibit and one of the walls was lined with a bunch of these things ops definitely looks way more ravaged by time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are called ushabti httpsenwikipediaorgwikiushabti but it doesnt really look like that to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep definitely a mummy finger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with nail polish too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow thats a brilliant tourist scam
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i love that museum love that its free now too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well those are in prime condition not all are that add a few thousand years in the sand and ending up with something along the lines of ops object isnt so far fetched
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id like a mummy finger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kc represent
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill finger your mummy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would like you to get some playdoh and stuff that thing into it that way we get an original image and can make better sense of the stuff going around also could you try before or after to spell out the words i cant because of all the brightness going on in your pic if you take a pic also always try to use a white background like in the second picture that way your camera can take advantage of whitebalance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are quite a few seals that feature three lions rampant might get you pointed in the right direction but it may be tough to narrow it down it would help to see what the outer circle of symbols looks like when its pushed into something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im down a rabbit hole way too deep i found the earl of carnarvon and the seventh earl was in the british military so i was thinking maybe he dropped it when he was participating in the wwii invasion of the place but i cant find that he was in that invasion although he was in the military this is too many levels of speculation although if you found that that seal said something in oldmiddle french wed have something to go on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i tried to clear it up in photoshop but its not much of an improvement also three rampant lions can be a lot of different families warwick hastings de la ford le englais fitzroger etc for example to many to be able to narrow it down i agree a better picture and if possible a imprint would help a lot edit httpsimgurcomaplmmg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,part of novelty dice set where the othe die has a two on every side so you always roll a seven
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen sets where the other die has and on it so they will always roll or
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a five sided die ill show myself out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how do we know the other three have fives
whatisthisthing,not_removed,worst game of catan ever
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved finally its been bugging my mom and i for months we found it in her back yard when we were doing yard work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is significant to anything besides up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,now that would really be a neat trick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im ashamed of how many times i searched that before i realized why i wasnt getting good results
whatisthisthing,not_removed,six how
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here i flipped it for you so you can see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i want to make a joke about how pointless your post is but this post is at least as pointless as yours
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my mom and me well not me but you you know what me mean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,craps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you get a on your first roll in craps you win
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i actually own one of those its sorta shaped like a triangular prism is guaranteed to be fair and certainly seems to be that way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,color them all in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with a white sharpie 😎
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and more proof here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had to look that up nonplatonic dice always give me the heebies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wasnt meant to be an insult
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes thats correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,even sided ones
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this the place where you get a huge amount of downvotes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eh those ones get a free pass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,apparently not if youre you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im also pretty sure that sided dice use isosceles triangles and so arent platonic

whatisthisthing,not_removed,pic of the back of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,repo guys use them extensively also a couple of companies pay for the data and sell the data to anyone cops repo companies marketing etc good way to make some extra money in spare time just drive around and collect data upload it get paid edit in states that only require rear plates people who are behind in payments will back into parking spots just so the repo plate readers wont figure out their lives location data is gold to marketing companies they buy data from state dmvs crossreference to multiple hits on the same plate and know the travel habits of target markets all they need from the dmv is zip code where the plate is registered they can get by without that with multiple hits on the same car in residential areas this is similar to big box stores using cell phone mac address from wifi and bluetooth to track where people wander around in stores how long they are in each area and how often they visit the store they dont need your wifi to connect they just capture the mac address of the phone looking for wifi the scanners dont transmit just receive the latest stuff captures cell phone data so even if your wifi is off they track you they also track cars that have stuff like onstar which is just a cell phone modem connected to the car maintenance network browsing history is the internet version of location data to marketing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good way to make some extra money in spare time just drive around and collect data upload it get paid i would like to know more
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all i know about it is that other people have mentioned it on reddit people in the repo business might know who to contact
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpswwwspicejunglecomsichuanpeppercorns although storing them for a long time would make them lose flavor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my uncle found whole container of them in his cabinet but they are unlabeled they smell vaguely citrusy and taste good though a bit astringent sort of like not spicy peppercorns
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sumac
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rose hips
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe goji berries they have a strong tea taste are sour pretty pricey at a farmers market i was at recently
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this my chinese professor called them hua jiao or red pepper but they arent really pepper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you thats them exactly edit fixing to mark solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you heat them up in hot oil while cooking they get even tastier if you eat a lot of them they will numb your mouth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have an up vote for use of the word astringent
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the style definitely looks more chinese than japanese to me but im not an expert
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a chinese foo dog the ball under its paw means it is male and it would have been made as part of a pair with the female holding a puppy under its paw the female will also have its mouth closed

whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is the exhaust port for the apu auxiliary power unit yes bar keep that is how they keep all the essential systems running when the engines are off it also helps with starting the main engines before leaving the boarding gate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exhaust for small engine dont know all the technical stuff but there is an enginemotor that is used for electrical when the big four are off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,apu nozzle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes exhaust for apu most of the time it is not used on the ramp ground carts are used instead the engines require air to spin the turbines the apu has a large thrust potential able to spool the turbines fast enough to compress air side note the apu can also be used in emergency situations on some aircraft to restart a failed engine this can be done at or below if my memory serves correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiauxiliarypowerunit for those who want to know i did
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you sure i think thats where it poops
whatisthisthing,not_removed,called an auxiliary power unit basically a jet engine powered ac generator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why bother with the weight emergency restarts could be handled by bleed air or hydraulics from other engines and while on the ground they could plug into the airport or carts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,long story short it is a small jet engine that does most the non propulsion things the main engines do without the fuel burn and jet blast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very interesting thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,planus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,little bit of column a little bit of column b
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why did they go with a jet over a normal motor if its just a generator what advantage does using a jet to power a generator have over a run of the mill motor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes true but in double engine failure scenarios like flying through volcano ash it can be utilized
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or even shorter story it is a electricity generator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it uses the same fuel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when the apu is used to start the large turbines it is providing air pressure as well as electricity
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it has a very large power density i dont know of any piston engines that have better power density at reasonable sizes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youve got most of the correct reasons in replies already but the apu also provides heat and air pressure for the air systems and hydraulic pressure for controls as well turbines are much more efficient for that purpose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its probably much lighter than a piston generator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not just electricity the compressor is used for the environmental systems and for bleed air that starts the engines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks almost like the top steam valve from an old pressure cooker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,q are there threads in the hole at the quadrant of the circular portion of the snowcone shaped insert it looks like that piece could be pushed into the angled portion causing the two sides to squeeze together making the hole in the middle contract somewhat a collet of sorts maybe but the piece being held by such a collet would be self uncentering
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like some kind of collet or clamping device to me perhaps a self made jig made for a specific purpose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an adjustable guide bushing for second end support when turning small diameter parts likely used in conjunction with a more traditional collet look at the fourth illustration down httpwwwproductionmachiningcomarticlesworkholdingforswissturning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you post this a couple of months back if not this exact thing was posted before im trying to find the link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a cam follower perhaps edt httprbcbearingscomcamfollowersindexhtm perhaps not though now that i see the other pictures this was my engineer husbands guess and he then proceeded to spend minutes explaining to me what a cam is and what a cam follower does while my eyes glazed over i would show him the other pictures you posted to see if he knows but i have things to do today p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like some kind of valve to me too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you pulled out all the set screws and seen how it comes apart or what becomes adjustable edit i just saw the second set of links is there a through hole on the smaller diameter perhaps its some sort of wirerod die
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rats wellhope you figure out what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they poured the concrete onto plywood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they would have used rough plywood forms to support the floor while pouring it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the perspective on this picture is killing my brain for my sake care to take a picture of the room
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i frequent a live theatre thats old enough that the ceiling was obviously poured onto a plank board form its really cool too bad they didnt mix the concrete with a wood color
whatisthisthing,not_removed,impression left from form work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because concrete doesnt float and you need to pour it into a form made from wood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its called offshutter concrete or concret brut which gave rise to the term brutalism
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok the puzzle is starting to take shape what the heck is that black thing and whats the big white square ahhh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where is this building out of curiosity
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay thanks thats pretty obvious now that i think about it p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hehe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh wow i feel dumb now thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a little spot under the weird jagged circular rooftop thing to the left of it i dont have a photo actually from that spot but uh well there it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont understand the down votes this answer seems to be accurate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its in the university of iowa under an alcove on the roof
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well you bothered to wonder which is more than most
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cheers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nobody wonders anymore they just look stuff up on their phone my son asked me what we did before cell phones and i told him we sat around and talked and wondered about stuff ah the good ol days
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a copper ground wire perhaps for a gas fireplace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it hollow if its hollow its the remains of a room temperature sensor for a gas fireplace burner if its solid then i agree that its an abandoned ground wire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well it doesnt look like its hooked up to anything so either it came undone or was never hooked up in the first place might be a good idea to have an electrician check it out if your gonna use the fireplace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a gas fireplace ive never had one before what does a copper ground wire do for one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not hollow never knew gas fireplaces had ground wires thanks i assume i shouldnt remove it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,prevents static buildup
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay ive never heard of a ground wire on a gas fireplace either and i frankly don t know why you would want to prevent a static electricity spark if its leaking gas into the room spark suppression aint helping anything the gas will eventually find an ignition source and sooner is better than later i can tell you that my gas fireplace burner does not have a ground wire and i personally installed it and i read the code when i did so so should you leave it well its not doing anything right now so removing it won t make anything worse but you should probably inspect the grounding and bonding on your electrical panel to make sure that this wire is not part of it that has been unsafely disconnected
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the response i was pretty befuddled trying to find information about what purpose this might serve this did spark a memory for me the prehome purchase inspection noted that the gas line was not bonded to the ground system i have a receipt from an electrician for the repair noting he bonded the gas line to the ground system i wonder if they are related perhaps i should have in inspected just in case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the rear windscreen you can choose to keep it up or put it down keeping it up reduces wind turbulence in the cabin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,others told you what it is but its interesting to note that having the glass there really does help the wind in the cabin as air flows over the front windscreen a vortice is formed behind it and the driver feels wind pressing at the back of the neck having glass behind can stop the vortice from wrapping around and blowing your hair everywhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a teaching aid that shows vibration or speed in the flywheel depending on the speed a different one of the prongs vibrates i can not remember the name of the thing though sorry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it demonstrates resonance as the gyro slows down different struts vibrate along with it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look like a gyroscope with kalimba parts attached at the top i have no clue what its for though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a skink i have caught a few in my life the blue ones are awesome looking agressive little buggers too they like to bite i also always thought it was interesting that they where the only slimy lizards i ever caught also as penance for catching it you should feed it a potato bug they love em
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just let it go thanks im in tx though so im not sure about the northern part
whatisthisthing,not_removed,north is relative texas is pretty far north of say uruguay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you have a point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like how they can shed their tails when attacked the tail continues to whip around distracting the predator while the skink slinks away the tail regrows but its not as nice looking as the original
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant find the exact one but id wager its a photocell for switching the light onoff similar to the ones in the following link httpwwwchinastreetlightcomphotocellhtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the hole that the blue thing is plugged into is where the daynight sensor goes its frequently used to power addon devices like mesh network wifi data links etc in this case im guessing that something plugs into the other end of the cable but its either been removed or not installed yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved and thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a light sensor for the auto headlights chevygmc right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i currently have three blazers some work some dont if i override the day running lights and drive into a tunnel or garage my lights will turn on you do know how to override the day time running lights right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes gmc sonoma are you sure why would that be in my speaker i always thought the button soul be something audio related
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant find anything on what it does
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats just where theyve always put it i had a blazer with the same thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it needs wires the speaker needs wires combining both into one harness saves a few pennies having the sensor in another component means installing one less component also means one less hole in dash padding saves more pennies automakers care about pennies when making of something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the headlights turn on automatically when it gets dark that sensor is what senses how dark it is if yours dont either the sensor doesnt work or you dont have it set to automatic mode i had the blazer for two years and to be honest i never knew how to change it from the automatic mode which it was in so i just went with it i know there was a dial for the lights but it seemed that if i touched it the lights went off and i wanted them on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh thanks i appreciate the help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,on some cars it dims the dashboard electronic display at night as well helps keep them visible during the day without ruining your night vision at night

whatisthisthing,not_removed,found on httpiimgurcomundefinedjpg some kind of quilt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,grandmother used to make these and she was not japanese is this a japanese thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty common in the usa as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yo yo quilts and blankets are very pioneer american late mom quilts and is working on one as we speak this hanging in a house in japan is the same as americans that decorate with japanese congi writing art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can to knock out these fabric yoyos quickly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope theyre common here in brazil as well in my region theyre called fuxico
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yo yo quilts and blankets are very pioneer american late nope a colleague actually researched yoyos for a scholarly paper in the late century they were tiny called marguerites and were used for decoration on clothes it wasnt until the when an assortment of cheerfulcolored inexpensive fabric became widely available that they were made larger dia and joined into coverlets the yoyo itself was introduced hence the name the problem with yoyo quilts is that they use a lot of fabric a yoyo needs a diameter circle and are purely decorative they dont provide any warmth iow theyre indicative of an era of prosperity fabrics in the one pictured date from the midlate to the late
whatisthisthing,not_removed,click bait article they put up something obscure and interesting to get you to click on the adsponsored site it usually has little to do with the actual description other than to lure you into the site
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a seriously
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i know i didnt click on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah i was betting light saber or sonic screwdriver and yeah this was actually a picture with a banner ad i got apparently the sith are attacking my town so i need a light saber thank you solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seriously allthough this might be something from your life that you encounter often the people on this planet who never saw a lightsaber far outnumber the ones who know what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i always laugh when i see those but i have to admit that i spend probably far too much time trying to figure out the context of the picture with the title and how it actually relates to reality ive seen that one before and i figured a light saber yeah thats exactly what everyone ought to be running around with for self protection and im sure the local officials would be totally cool with that still i totally want to click on it just to see where theyre going with that one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a honeybee beehive to me with the separated vertical combs httpsbeespotterorgtopicssocial edit it is a feral bee hive httpbeesourcecomresourceselementsofbeekeepingferalbeehives if its on your property dont destroy it call an apiarist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what part of the world is the picture taken in be as specific as you can without identifying yourself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry i was not specific in baton rouge la
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it must be moved do this you can also just leave it alone if its high off the ground and away from populated or heavily trafficked areas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,baton rouge la
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no that is a zoomed up pic sorry it is pixelated the hive is up high
whatisthisthing,not_removed,honeybees they will die from exposure if the weather gets cold enough you might find a beekeeper interested in the bees but its not very likely wrong season to move bees into new equipment theyll die unless a lot of work gets put into them

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is an rfid vehicle monitoring system it has very distinctive features the part hanging over the road is like that because the antenna used is highly directional and the rfid tags on the trucks are placed on the windshield the camera midway up the pole is used to take a picture of the driver in case a dispute comes up later or the company needs to associate a driver with a truck the windowed box at the bottom is a camera system for taking super high contrast pictures of license plates at high speeds the box down the road is likely an optical trigger for determining the moving speed of the vehicle the thing sticking out at the top of the pole where it bends is a unidirectional microwave antenna to allow connectivity with a server here are some confirmation images of similar systems httpwwwdecatureucompicsevrinpng as to why this one is where it is i would have to imagine it is here in order to either track outgoing trucks from a farm or is used by the government of that town to track and bill fleet vehicles or vehicles of a certain weight a fee for using the road as heavy vehicles do the most damage to a road almost certain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be for counting vehicles older systems usually just lay a hose across the road and measure the pressure change when vehicles driver over it but this way could count both the number and types of vehicles passing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the us the cameras are used for analytics basically it is used to help control traffic lights according to the flow of the vehicles they are also used for live feeds only to identify wrecks or road hazards they dont record the footage due to the amount of attorneys that would be asking for video recordings for civil cases tickets cameras are much larger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,weather station
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the us we have alpr automatic license plate readers their stated intent is to find stolen cars documented cases of abuse are plentiful maybe its one of those
whatisthisthing,not_removed,roads are monitored by camera for every camera that could get you a fine about just sit there connected to the road operators maybe wrong terminology not english
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it may be for road construction i have started seeing things similar to this picture used with a light to control traffic guess its cheaper than having a guy with a stop and go sign
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be for a proposed intersection that pole looks to be way overbuilt for simply a camera andor sensor it looks like its meant to hold signage or lights
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my bet is a license plate scanner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be an automatic toll both we have all over the place in norway they scan license plate and automatically bill you for passing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you get snow it could be for tracking road conditions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its most likely a roadway monitoring gantry it can measure anything from emissions and noise to road conditions and traffic makeup
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very interesting thanks for your response
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep we have those all over the place here it counts vehicles or in some cases detects waiting vehicles so that it lnows when to change the lights
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in some cities the feed from the traffic cam raw feed is unrestricted and available on the transit web site
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like this picture is taken in norway if so this is what a roadside weatherstation looks like over here so yes it may be one in the making
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats interesting there is a light about later
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my city or state isnt that advanced it would be nice though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if the photo is from norway the norwegian public roads administration has a database of all the infrastructure on the public road network available here the amount of information in the database is mind blowing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a very minor road they may check the traffic to see where it should be on their priorities list oiw if you drive back and forth like a madman for some months they might upgrade the road
whatisthisthing,not_removed,photo was taken in denmark
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or they may put a speed camera in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was studying the photo and thought denmark would be a better guess due to the flatness and the looks of the house
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre for spearing olives for martinis this has already been asked in the last hours

whatisthisthing,not_removed,got these in the mail today no description attached seems to be sent out as a holiday gift
whatisthisthing,not_removed,several times too i expect more to come
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those foam labels were great to peel off in strips
whatisthisthing,not_removed,trial offer for something not for that coke bottle styrofoam was a common type label back in the that was the same era that mcdonalds sold big macs in styrofoam boxes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was an thing having a thin foam wrapper on the bottles and not just coke i guess they thought it acted as like a weak insulator between a cold bottle and your hand but i remember them being cold and sweating the same as any they got phased out by the time the ecological nightmare of styrofoam was shunned in the but i will say they were very therapeutic to peel off and around a bottle in a big spiral and they didnt use glue so you were always left with a nice clean naked bottle to reuse source i lived through the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wasnt that for the new coke horror i kinda remember them pushing those small bottles out to get ppl to try the new coke bingo just found it on ebay was
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and mcdlt keep the hot side hot and the cool side wait for it cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,child here can confirm here in australia the bottle size was called a buddy i cant remember the exact volume but from memory it was about the same size as a can
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i beg to differ
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what are you begging to differ new coke did use block letters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,original coke had block letters too before new coke was introduced the letters in new coke however were more bold also i distinctly remember the c in old cans and bottles of original coke was separated from oke new coke connected i can find at the moment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would be a tire swing just not made with a real tire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tire swing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jeez what kinda childhood did you have that you had no idea what a tire swing is serious question
whatisthisthing,not_removed,had one of those exact tire swings about years ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,y tho
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we had real tyre swings didnt think if you where making a swing in a factory you would make it tyre shaped i thought tyre swings where for people who cant afford to buy a swing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah this is the best and worst of both worlds kids these days are protected from everything including getting friction burns from an old goodyear hanging from a rope tied to a tree nowdays the tireswings are even safer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah but why a plastic one tires are cheap used is cheaper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tire rubber is a suspected carcinogen and the steel belts can poke out and cause injury if the rubber degrades if youre a company manufacturing kids playsets you avoid those potential liability issues by manufacturing a fake tire from a known plastic mix instead of using a real tire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why manufacture its a rope and a tire nothing to make

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its vaguely mushroomshaped well an upside down mushroom in the pic about at the widest part at the top of the bit in the pic theres a small oring edit oring shape molded into it its not a separate oring around the narrow bit and the whole thing is made of a stiffish rubbery substance i recently did some work on my bicycles disc brakes in the area i found this so it might be related but i cant see any obvious unplugged holes i hope its not important
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a bleeder valve cap disc brakes use fluid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes that was my thought but i cant see where it might go
whatisthisthing,not_removed,keeps them in alignment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to poke you in the finger so you know youve achieved maximum grippage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but wouldnt there be a risk of damaging your sterile gloves in a surgery situation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is true specifically if you compress them past to the point where the two tips would move past each other and be bent without this spike
whatisthisthing,not_removed,intuitively i feel like this is the correct answer the welded pieces of steel dont need this little pin to stay aligned the pin is probably so you can tactilely sense when the tips should be touching
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive used them for years and never had that problem nitrile gloves are pretty puncture resistant and i dont think ive ever poked myself with them though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no the tips will flex if they have any torque applied to them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good enough answer for me thanks man
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uwhoarted was close except its for a router table believe its called a coping sled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a crosscut jig for a tablesaw you clamp the piece of wood on the front so you can keep you hands away from the blade while making a square cut
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it needs a price underneath to fit into the groove on the surface of the saw though

whatisthisthing,not_removed,for putting carpet down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah this is a nice one too all hdpe not cheap materials if youre not into woodworking you should be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like uhmw to me looks very well made
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely possible uhmw would be more slick and expensive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i appreciate the difference in those two materials but to the layman just call it really nice plastic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when making a sled you want the material to be a slippery as possible also its a very specialized tool that most laymen would have zero use for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but a layman might still want to know what its used for and made out of which is kinda the point of this thread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree which is why i called it by its correct name and not really nice plastic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its called a butlers table it supposed to act as both a tray and a table httpwwwscullyandscullycomfurnituretablessidetablesmahoganybutlerstraytableaxd

whatisthisthing,not_removed,old oriental belt from a friend who acquired it during wwii he was a submariner in the us navy he brought it back without much explanation to his then wife we suspect hanky panky but cant ask since they both have passed away if this is the wrong sub or there is a better place please let me know we know it is a belt about ft long when unrolled it is very stiff and heavily embroidered with goldmetallic thread and raised areas the blue velveteen type material photos are the back we think and the rosette is the center front we are hoping to find out where what culture it comes from japanese chinese malaysia and if it was contemporary to wwii or older we doubt japanese since he returned mainland before japan was conquered and didnt go back afterwards but what do i know thats why im here added the stitching seems to be over bamboo slats or small strips
whatisthisthing,not_removed,think the name for this is obi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its decorated that much and made from bamboo and cloth eastern asia seems likely i dont know much about some of themits definitely not japanese but the material and style makes it seems chinese in origin try looking at some httpsenwikipediaorgwikihanfu styles and see if it matches up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,obi is just japanese for belt traditional obi dont look like this theyre just pieces of cloth with a simple rope attached compared to the thicker material you can see coming off this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you but i know this is not an obi it is very stiff and the raised portions are made of bamboo sticks heavily embroidered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this does seem to be closer chinese and perhaps more of a south eastern asia origin ill google some more hanfu new term for me and others in this area the guy we got it from and his wife were wonderful friends of ours for over years and at the time we met he had already had a stroke and was unable to speak very well and his wife who recently passed didnt know much more about it other than he got it during wwii when in asia he was also a pearl harbor survivor in a submarine we had her stories but again he couldnt talk we will never see their like again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,either honey fungus or a sulphur tuft if there is rotting wood nearby look for black bootlace mycellae

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have added two more to the album httpimgurcomazrgie
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wild guess white noise generator some people use them to block out other noises it helps them sleep im guessing the time display is a countdown timer it shuts off after a certain amount of time clock radios often have this feature
whatisthisthing,not_removed,open it up and look inside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can curse on the internet its allowed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,plausible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op probably got caught in a profanity filter on the first post some words will get a post removed automatically to prevent spamabuse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its from the dealers key management system it interfaces with a rack that has personalized passcodes for access nothing related to the car or any great treasure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its from one of these systems to electronically manage keys and the like httpwwwkeypersystemscomproductselectronickeycontrol edit pic of the fob
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is something i found on my keychain from the dealership when i bought my nissan altima
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a magnetic key to open the key lock box that are on some cars on the dealer lot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a holder for the keys to put inside one of the lockbox things they put on windows so the keys are already at the car to look at the car salesman has a small gadget that gets reprogrammed every day he puts in his pin holds it up against the box hanging from window pops open and that comes out with the keys without it the box doesnt close properly aka if you put the keys in without sliding that part in it will jam or not lock the box allowing it to be open experience
whatisthisthing,not_removed,which part of that is the key
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe its for the dealership the magnet goes on a large board where all the keys are for all the cars each spot has a number on a grid and the dealer can quickly and easily find the keys i would take it back to the dealer if its not too much of a hassle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think this is solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so i can throw it away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the dealer might like that back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats slick my family was in the car business most my life we had a wall of nails in the back with keys laid in the pattern of the car lot tech makes me wish we still had all that seems like things advanced nicely
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op what color is your car ive been staring at the picture for like minutes trying to make that scribble into an english word that represents a color and i have failed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it go in the slot where you slide your key fob like a place filler if your fob aint in the slot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for sure im trying to look up the system to show you an example but i cant remember the name of it i know a dealer who has that exact same setup am a dealer myself ask over in raskcarsales theyll identify it immediately
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its not too much trouble id drop it off at the dealers if it has any electronic components it might be hard to recycle but the dealer could probably reuse it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats for a pack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,charge them for it dont give anything back to a dealer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it says now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a rental based on the hang tag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can read that as black
whatisthisthing,not_removed,usuppercabbageuk is right it says black
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope and the car is push to start
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you id what the white part is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,something along the lines of keywatcher
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we use it army dealership keypersystemscom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh yeah my mistake i thought they were at quantities of or more see im the guy who gets a lifetime supply of swedish fish when i dont read bag vs case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah man using periods to ruin a good thing eh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats for a single order if you look at the theres a bit of a discount
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can see a bla if i look close enough thanks it was bothering me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know same on my maxima it has a slot lower left of the steering wheel for the key fob to slide in it doesnt need to be there to start but its there for convenience as a place to hold your fob
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the lock that keeps the mechanism attached to the keys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a tamper seal very much like what you have on your houses electric service meter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont see a problem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well a bag could be a lifetime supply if you play your cards right or wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why not women have been using them for centuries to ruin good things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually it is there for if the battery on the fob is too weak for it to function on our altima you do it by holding the fob to the pushbutton
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so it should probably be attached to the key itself rather than the easilyopened keyring right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,one day youll have a lifetime supply of all the things that you need thats not a great day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doesnt look like a keyring but a ring embedded into the white part you could easily cut it off but then you cant really reassemble it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you obtain the key it really doesnt matter if its attached or not anymore does it its just a filing system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah the one wire is integrated but that wire is looped through a standard spiral keyring instead of a hole in the key itself you could easily slip it right off intact
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh i see what you mean need more coffee yeah in terms of inventory control this might be useful in terms of theft prevention probably not so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its got to be for just inventory control car dealerships have no shortage of tools that can cut through either ring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the tip to a walking canestick the hollow end goes on the wood and it gives grip and wear resistance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not a bullet is it lead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,imgur is broken tonight but from the top of the thumbnail it looks like a drill bit that snapped off are the points at the top sharp on the sides
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you sure it isnt a broken phillips head screw bit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty small walking stick diameter of a pencil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is lead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sharpish but it is made of lead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it was made of another material but lead maybe not the best material for a screwdriver tip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahh i see i somehow missed the giant pencil in the picture ive never used lead arrowheads but i have used ones that were similar in shape to this though with less exaggerated cross shape perhaps its an old arrow tip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i reload my own bullets and have studied firearms my whole life the tip doesnt fit any bullets ive ever seen and if the rear hollow part is like a thimble then it most certainly is not a bullet if a bullet is hollow the hollow part needs to be at the front otherwise it would have horrible accuracy and tumble through the air as soon as it left the barrel of the firearm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you sure it is not brassbronze
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the tip doesnt fit any bullets ive ever seen and if the rear hollow part is like a thimble then it most certainly is not a bullet if a bullet is hollow the hollow part needs to be at the front otherwise it would have horrible accuracy and tum airgun
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope too large and incorrectly weighted and shaped not gun related at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,man this looks so familiar to me i want to say it has to do with something electrical
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to add to what others have said the reason its hr is because croatia is called hrvatska in serbocroatian
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it used to be and still is indication of the country the car was from especially in europe but they have morphed into almost anything as one of a million examples the outer banks in north carolina has one that says obx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen cars with these black and white ovals with random letters and sometimes numbers on the back ive seen it in ontario and ny any clue what it could be i dont remember what the other letter or number combinations i saw were
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the car in your picture is from croatia httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofinternationalvehicleregistrationcodes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hr croatia mne montenegro srb serbia bih bosnia herzegovina in balkan countries you need these stickers as part of law to cross borders
whatisthisthing,not_removed,used to have these alot in the due to the european contries not being printed on the license plates which they do nowsoif you went on holiday you would need a couple of these to basically say where your from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats correct im european and its very common here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre tourist souvenirs now sold in gift shops ive seen orl for orlando
whatisthisthing,not_removed,right httpwwwworldstandardseucarsovalstickers is more info edit wrong link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the un geneva convention on road traffic and vienna convention on road traffic both included a requirement that a distinguishing sign of the country of registration had to be displayed on the rear of the vehicle when traveling outside its country of registration which could be part of the number plate or a separate emblem the oval sticker became a standard and the abbreviations for the countries are all detailed httpwwwworldstandardseucarsovalstickers on my frequent seasons in the us and canada i started noticing that americans would use these country stickers on us registered cars as some sort of marker of affiliation with the country of their sticker when i inquired in some cases it was heritage and in some cases they had been expat in the country in question and perhaps even purchased the us spec car abroad in that country before returning this use is counterproductive to the intention but as the stickers were not otherwise used or recognized in the usa not really a big deal the difference between a european number plate and a canada ontario one is obvious by both shape and colour so it is obvious to the observer that this is not a car registered in croatia then i started to see vt stickers first on vermont registered cars and then later on cars registered elsewhere the story from the car drivers was well vermont is so distinctive it seems like another country from the rest of the us then i started seeing them for all kinds of tourist regions and other states my absolute favourite has to be the one from the berkshires tourist region of massachusetts where the residents and frequent visitors proudly declare themselves to be a httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermberk via the sticker on the back of their car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some people put marathon times or distances in them ive even seen dont run
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a lot of them are just tourist magnets lbi for long beach island nyc for new york city and so on basically just places those people have been to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,like said most of the time they are tourist magnets also marathon magnets common ones are and which are half marathon and marathon magnets also random initials could be the initials of a city or beach for example a common one in north carolina is obx which stands for the outer banks which is a beach area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more likely its from canada with a croatian novelty sticker it has an ontario license plate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is one of those things that i find myself getting irrationally angry over i see these things everywhere and theyre always so cryptic nobody but the owner of the car knows what they mean its so pointless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats bizarre to me in europe theyre functional the idea of using them for decoration didnt cross my mind until i read the rest of the thread

whatisthisthing,not_removed,gordmans sells offseason over produced items from stores that closed and so on so their items could come from anywhere kind of like ross and tj maxx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i expect it was packaged with philips hue bulbs for dusting them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a tag from a rigging sling with indicated angles with the safe load limit for each the lower limit is somewhat erased
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so whats a rigging sling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you this thing sparked a long debate at our family meet up yesterday im glad that this is solved now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,either ropes or those flat straps you use to hoist something a rigger will hook them up and determine if the lift is safe think something like hoisting an engine out of a car using an engine crane and the straps you put around the engine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it goes across the road and cars drive over it i would guess it counts the traffic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do the black tubes run across the road i think those are used to count traffic edit like this device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep definitely for traffic monitoring get a unicycle and screw up their stats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre counting traffic by counting the number of vehicles that travel over the black lines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre called
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i pass them at the legal speed limit hoping they think i have a stupid short wheel base
whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha perfect idea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably a rfid reader for asset tracking they keep track of where things like beds computer carts and medical machines are in the hospital
whatisthisthing,not_removed,beaumont royal oak mi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i second that do you know what hospital they were at
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be the power supply for one of your devices cheap power supplies often emit a high pitched whine though its usually a steady tone unplug everything and see if it still happens then plug them all back in one at a time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how close do you keep your cell phone to the clock radio sometimes the speakers can pick up interference from your cell phone it sounds like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kudos on capturing it with an app with better data you could ask our folks at rsignalidentification edit do you have any recording of the tone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like it could be coil noise in an electrical device httpsenmwikipediaorgwikicoilnoise try leaving one device at a time unplugged from the wall and see if you can find the culprit one device can generate multiple tones depending on how many coils they have so the tv is still on the table
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont seem to be able to add text to my post so ill put it here i hear this tone some days when i first wake up its frustratingly intermittent it might be silent for minutes and then happen again when it does it sounds a little like slow morse code ive tried repeatedly to grab my phone and run the frequency spectrum app on it and do a screen grab finally managed to im years old i shouldnt be able to hear a tone this high though my wife cant hear it the only things in the bedroom that it could be are a cable box two clock radios and a carbon monoxide detector the tv was off and as you can see in the photos generates a different tone anyway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is likely that you have a wristwatch with an alarm in a drawer i suffered the same noise and that is what i finally found
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i used to have an emf reader app on my phone definitely sounds like it could be electrical i would try using something like that to help pinpoint the source
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it happens around the same time every day have you tried shutting your power off breaker box at that time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be your cable box pulling down its daily update
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you make it stop by shutting off the breaker to the bedroom that would eliminate a lot of stuff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first guess would be a switching power supply lower quality or older ones can make noises in that frequency range i have an led flashlight with a switching power supply in it that makes a slight but noticeable whine when it is on check any power supplies chargers or anything with an inverter like a cfl lightbulb
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a lot of power supplies have audible transformer frequencies get up close to any power bricks or brick plugs you have plugged in and see if they make the same sound
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it possible to share the recording so we can hear it im guessing most redditors arent capable of imagining a tone from viewing a wave on a graph
whatisthisthing,not_removed,check anything thats charging a battery laptops phones etc and unplug them one by one i keep my laptop unplugged at night for the same reason
whatisthisthing,not_removed,considering it is an intermittent high pitch it could be a busted capacitor in a circuit capacitors charge and discharge intermittently problems on the circuit can cause the capacitor to behave strangely even emit sound i once had this happen on a power brick of a notebook i owned you can check those put them against your ear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved it was the adapter i was using the charge my phone overnight i kept trying to directionalize the sound not easy at that frequency but determined it was coming from the corner of the room i was nearest moved the phone around and got a huge spike at hz when i moved it near the power strip went away when i unplugged the adapter but left the strip on adapter is a dve switching adapter model fus made in china i recommend against buying one and using it by your bed

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had an older power bar that did this same thing it almost sounded like a repetitive robotic noise once i replaced it the noise was gone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont have any idea what to make of your frequency readings but judging by your story could it be something with a dying battery like maybe one of those greeting cards that make noise when you open them or something check batteries in your smoke alarms and whatnot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cable box would surprise me the least have you tried walking around to see where the spectrum shows it the strongest have you tried running to your outlets when it happens and unplugging stuff to figure out disconnecting which plug makes it stop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my lights can make weird noises sometimes right when theyre about to die if that helps also note the hz hum is a direct byproduct of the frequency the electric mains run at see httpsenwikipediaorgwikimainshum even though i dont think that will help you too much that is what is causing it though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would cut all power in the house to eliminate electric interference and see if i could still hear it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have a desktop on your room
whatisthisthing,not_removed,regarding the pic where theres a tone between when you turn on your tv i used the same app and see the same spike in that range when my tv is on edit just tested again in a different room far from the tv with all the wall sockets turned off at the wall and i still saw the spike could it be coming from the phone itself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was your tv off at the mains or was it on standby
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes please me too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nightly if comcast

whatisthisthing,not_removed,would be great for making tomato juice i believe ours works with a crank but you sieve it through a screen like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is correct i have one you can also use it to make baby food
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its hard to tell based on the picture but im assuming that youd recognize a guitar and wouldnt be asking if you thought it was that knowing that gateway drugs has sitar in their music my best guess is that its an electric sitar they look a lot like guitars some of them but sound completely different it would have sounded verytwangy for lack of a better description does that sound like a possibility to you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think thats it thanks for the help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the headstock and body style are indicative of though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bandcamp says he plays guitar and sitar so ublargattack is probably correct httpgatewaydrugsbandcampcom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not arguing just for kicks but a vox guitar is a guitar the very first one on the left in the image i posted is very similar to what the artist is shown playing here with a headstock logo variation and you say they play both guitar and sitar i see one indication of sitar and multiple of guitar

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks a little bit like an electricians knife edit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a tourney knife you make little football shaped potatoes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a i did not find one exactly like this but i have used one decades ago just like the ops
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i use one very similar to take the outer skin off onions like a paring knife
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youre right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,never knew there was such a thing but the google images looks pretty spot on that and httpwwwpremaxshopcomen doesnt seem to carry woodworking tools yet chestnuts are rather plentiful in italy

whatisthisthing,not_removed,leon luis from garo i believe google for golden knight garo then i didnt finish the anime but i believe they are the same person
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a character from the monster hunter series i believe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did he have that sort of weapon i looked up pictures of golden knight garo and it looks similar but the weapon in this picture seems to be some sort of club
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had a similar thought the styling of the armor is certainly reminiscent but i havent played a mh game since the psp days and googling monster hunter golden and monster hunter characters was fruitless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the only weapon he had was a sword im not sure were the weapon is from but im still pretty convinced the character is from garo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a travel bag from the late or
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well it does say penguin on the key and on the metal clasp where the latch locks in they did make luggage and travel bags so thats probably what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its a pleather type or vinyl that looks like leather id look into peters bag corp they made many many different bags in the and similar in style the only branding i think they had was the removable tag attached to the strap and maybe a cloth tag on the inside also penguin still makes bags but im not sure of their age without looking it up and it doesnt quite seem to be up to their quality
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im especially looking for info on the brand or where it was made thanks for checking it out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant find the maker but i think i found a bag by them on etsy maybe the seller knows more about them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nothing to add except whooo nebraska
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been looking into their bags and the locking mechanism and design seems similar thanks for your help likely solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heres a good rule of thumb if you go picking food in the winderness be sure to know exactly what youre picking because if youre wrong you could die mushrooms can range from tasty food to actual death this is even more the case with onions i dont mean i dont mean i mean if youre worried about whether or not you should eat it dont because if youre wrong you could die
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its a fungus and you find it wild if you know what it is dont eat it if you dont know what it is dont eat it either way you live option thats not a given
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rwhatisthismushroom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rmycology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well its a lot more likely you would just get an upset stomach tbh luckily for op he has a giant puffball which is one of the easiest fungi to identify a child could positively id one of these i learned when i was about eight years old another rule of thumb for puffballs is that with earthballpuffball mushrooms like this one which do not have the stalked form of a basidiocarp they are safe to eat if the flesh is white earthballs are inedible and they are dark inside all species of puffballs are safe to eat and pretty tasty batterfried but they become inedible when they go to spore and get dark inside so if it is a puffball and you cut it open and its white youre good however be careful not to mistake the forms of young mushrooms for puffballs for instance young basidiocarps inside the universal veil or stinkhorn eggs etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how ridiculous people all over the world have foraged for mushrooms since times immemorial i do it all the time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i seriously think that the wild mushroom harvester and his wife both died eating mis identified wild mushrooms here in america a few years back literally wrote the book on identities and toxities of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how in the world could anyone mistake the destroying angel for anything else especially ink caps they look nothing alike
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at least in northern california there are a couple of deadly look alikes every year it seems some experienced hunter dies or loses a liver one year it was a chinese family they knew the chinese varieties well here not so good its the amanita xxx that gets them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,david arora is alive and well and still foraging for fungus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah volvariella volvacea is super popular in asia and it looks a lot like amanita phalloides
whatisthisthing,not_removed,love you more
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they even have it printed this way on macys website im curious too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this might sound stupid but is there anything on the other side of the socks they appear to be from and theres no indication there of what the symbols mean either
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its missing the third sock which says your sister because you are a three legged freak
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is the barcode still on there theres usually an abbreviated item description near it

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wish i could but the boots are long gone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i was hoping someone might be able to tell me the brandmodel but its a lot to ask with the crappy pic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you know what stylemodel of wolverines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,go to sportsman guides web site they may have something either similar or identical
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinda like these though i think you get ones with higher tops too

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a printers key what you have there is a third fourth printing of whatever edition that is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as has been said its something for indicating which printing the book is and is a holdover from when they used copper plates for printing with each additional edition they would shave the next number in the series off so the first edition might have and the next time they reprinted the book using the old plates someone would carve off the and you would get and so on later codes were added for indicating the year as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe its the fourth printing but otherwise yes exactly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oops yeah youre right its fourth

whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be the a spring from a folding knife
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks unlike any pick ive ever seen far too thick and beefy id be inclined to say its a pivot bar or lock link for some mechanism but the lack of any holes makes that hard to believe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how big is it is it really narrow it might be whats known as a slim jim they are slid down the door of a car between the weather stripping and the window and can be used to disengage the lock however all the slim jims ive ever seen were straight not curved and had no features like the notches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i found this thing in a car park at a sony facility its about inches long nothing else was found with it im almost certain its a pick but i cant imagine what kind of lock it would be used with edit definitely not certain its a pick anymore it is smooth on all surfaces so it doesnt look as if its broken off of anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that was a good find what are you some sort of automatic umbrella expert
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what a find well done mate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its very narrow but i dont know if its long enough to be a slim jim would inches be long enough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is inches ever long enough they are usually at least a foot long so i think slim jim is off the table

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it says fruits soda mochi probably a fruity soda flavored candy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a lychee jelly candy the cup should contain a whiteclear jellolike substance with a chunk of lychee fruit in the middle im guessing the warning label is for the choking hazard that the chunk of lychee poses to the young and the elderly

whatisthisthing,not_removed,dat was pushed back and hobbled at the whim of the record industry because bit perfect copies of cds could be made but yes cd kicked butt because most music was released on cd and cd players were reasonably affordable

whatisthisthing,not_removed,question how do you know its uranium
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this might not be popular but i actually saw this glass on american pickers but it was more of an opaque white color heres a detailed description httpswwwrealorreprocomarticlebottomsuptumblersbymckee is this an original it could be worth something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it should look awesome under black light could you post another photo that gives us the nsfw angle

whatisthisthing,not_removed,my mom has one exactly like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well lets see it lit up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh damn they even have the exact one op has
whatisthisthing,not_removed,require to to down the shot in one because you cant put it down you mean its upside down in the pic after a shot cant find video of it in action
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this guy cups
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey now the phrase bottoms up makes sense although i have no idea of this is where that saying actually comes from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how can you not put it down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cant you just put the lid back on and flip it back over and set it down the same way again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,didnt know there were people who didnt finish their shots in one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it a syphon or just a pyramid upsidedown when full
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mean yes but it is technically an increase over background however minor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was a big thing for a short while on reddit btw tons of people posted their uranium glass pics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the color gives it away there are uranium glass optical filters in my lab that have the same color
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it will glow brightly under a black light ive got several pieces including a shot glass just a regular one it stopped being a thing in the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it doesnt look like that company made them in uranium glass but i assume it was a common design because they dont manufacture uranium glass now its definitely old and probably worth a pretty penny though edit i take it back your link didnt mention it but they did in fact use uranium glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think shot glasses have a preferred gender
whatisthisthing,not_removed,depression apple green vs vaseline glass but same shot glass edit httpsenwikipediaorgwikiuraniumglassothercolours
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes i am thinking you cant set it down with liquid in it due to its shape
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the butt is unstable you cant rest it on the butt it rocks back and forth so you empty it before you put it down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bottoms up just means down the drink ie the bottom of the glass upwards
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure the story goes the other way around iow youve got the story bottoms up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the glass in the picture is upside down if it was filled with liquid you couldnt set it down because the butt is unstable youd have to one off the shot and put it on its little cover
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it has no lid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just look at the picture dude no siphon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its empty when upside down its a cup that cant be set down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,then you probably shouldnt have bananas in your house
whatisthisthing,not_removed,technically correct but in practice it is negligible and from a distance of more than a foot to a yard the increase becomes indistinguishable from background unless you live in a thick lead sarcophagus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the important thing is that its safe and i would drink out of it myself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah but the linear no‐threshold model is probably wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,who would downvote you for pointing that out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you actually cant distinguish uranium glass that way as they have glass without uranium thats the same color you need a black light i thought i had a uranium glass for years but it turns out it wasnt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,leave that gender shit in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,funny when ive been using the same rocks glass for scotch nights in a row i call it depression glass too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it also may have a bit of a double meaning here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ohhh well how bout that thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh the top comes off made me think the bottom was a sort of lid like you filled it put the lid on then flipped it the top is pourthrough then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i zoomed in yeah i see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or smoke detectors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wait people dont ordinarily live in thick lead sarcophaguses damn it i knew dad was lying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you doin all right man
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ditto but bourbon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i rather think that goes without saying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the photo it does appear to be sitting on some kind of saucer or cover so maybe im wrong the point is that youre supposed to drink whatever the glass contains all in one go because its designed to be put down on its open end
whatisthisthing,not_removed,smoke detectors emit alpha particles which can be blocked by a sheet of paper nothing is going to escape from the housing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,luckily i dont
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok son time for the bad news
whatisthisthing,not_removed,america icium
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it getting hot in here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,best of luck if a fire starts in the middle of the night
whatisthisthing,not_removed,except in the uk they use plutonium for their smoke detectors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is fine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,plutoinium
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we really dont
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nuclear its pronounced nuclear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure they used to at least i read something about it being chosen for its longer half life certainly the httpwwwntiorganalysisarticlessmokedetectorsplutoniumseizednearbishkekkyrgyzstan used plutonium in smoke detectors

whatisthisthing,not_removed,hand cranked shoe polisher
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like coriander and anise
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant tell you what it is but i can say its not frankincense edit heres a good page with a picture of frankincense httptambelacomblogfrankincense
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a mix of any spices the vendor had left over on the shop floor at the end of the day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks kinda like httpsenwikipediaorgwikimukhwas which is indian what is the blue stuff is it sugary
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are either of those safe to burn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im thinking it might just be that a load of different shit from the floor it might include some nuggets though see to the here maybe some low quality frankincense what do you think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres no way in hell im eating an unidentified substance that i picked up out of the drawer in a turkish market
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ubaconreceptacle is spot on definitely coriander seeds and anise you could eat them assuming they were clean but i wouldnt burn them because you would get the same smell as when you accidentally burn your spices while cooking not pleasant just out of curiosity i googled turkish for coriander and its kisnis so its possible they gave you something that sort of sounds like frankincense
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wouldnt know for sure but my guess is it smells nice the way it isif you set it on fire it would probably flame up and not smell so good try a little outside first
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can burn them in small amounts but its not the best smell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there might be a nugget or two in there but frankincense is usually a brighter yellow that looks more like myrrh to me but i dont think it is either myrrh or frankincense myrrh is usually darker and more jagged than frankincense
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you are going to have to find someone else to do it then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a small silver or pewter crucifix meant to worn on a necklace here are some more pictures of it httpiimgurcomlqdifvjjpg httpiimgurcomidzrhmljpg the other mark on the back just says italy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this might also be a stylized representation of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiarmachristi the middle thing maybe a whip or palm leaf as in httpsenwikipediaorgwikipalmsunday around it a crown of thorns and below the whipping post or viewed upside down you can see the httpsenwikipediaorgwikitaucross symbolising crucifixion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a ill guess thats a makers hallmark but cannot verify such
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i know the cross very well it was just the symbol i was unsure of it probably is a makers mark just wondered if anyone knew the maker or perhaps if it means something else
whatisthisthing,not_removed,knuckle duster or if you want to find one online self defence ring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the male symbol any info on it where you found it etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like something theyd sell at a mall ninja shop as a tactical ring of some sorts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a bottle opener ring seen similar ones
whatisthisthing,not_removed,artsy bottle cap opener also the street friendly name for a knuckle duster since the cut outs will fit a bottle cap if it is made as a knuckle duster its a poorly designed one or made by someone who doesnt know how to hold one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a bottle opener scratch that more like a small box end wrench thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like an intro to cnc water jet cutters project
whatisthisthing,not_removed,knuckle duster
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rmallninjashit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed and it looks like they tried to integrate bottle openers on it too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i imagine if it was used for that purpose the finger would just snap under the impact
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with a builtin socket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this sub is hilarious omg ty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,welp they got a new subscriber
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a proper knuckle duster would not have a point but be rounded and a bit wider and that rests against your palm the finger goes through the hole and holds it tight to your palm when you make a fist being pointed puts it in the mall ninja cataory becuase it makes it unusable the bottle opener and wrench are a functional decoy are you going to tell an authority figure you are carry a knuckle duster or are you going to tell them its just a bottle opener andor keychain wrench
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its sitting on a belt sander for the picture if this is at maker space my bet is this was a project for someone who was learning how to use either a cnc mill or water jet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,commenting because i couldnt add text to the image post from my reddit app the first image is of the front of the can and the other three are bits of some kind of script written on the can i tried to use google translates ocr feature but it can only do ocr if you know the language that the source text is in shame because its a pretty mindblowing feature especially when used on plain text without much formatting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,usually caterpillars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe this is httpsenwikipediaorgwikifallwebworm a type of mothcaterpillar commonly known as the fall webworm theyre common in sc starting around this time of year theyre a pest but they usually dont do serious damage to trees
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just to clarify to op theyre called worms but theyre a form of caterpillar at least in my area a bag worm refers to a different caterpillarmoth that makes a cocoon using detritus from the plant to make a cocoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a list of gimpphotoshop brushes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heres a link for closer inspection looks to me like it might be a safari window the top seems to have an address bar as well as a standard apple button on the right side the red also bleeds into the title bar like it does in safari when you scroll however on the red background at the right side it almost looks like there are a couple desktop icons so no idea really please reply if you figure it out im curious now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just guessing that isnt just one of those hairs broken off and deteriorating theres one missing from the upper left
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might ask rwhatsthisbug perhaps its a known parasite or something great image clarity
whatisthisthing,not_removed,posting sem images without colorizing them in photoshop smh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the and pic it looks like the surface texture is really different between the unknown and the hairs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the one with the handle is almost certainly a purse sized silent butler a kind of portable ashtray the other one probably is as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the one without the handle might be considered a thats what i always assumed they were anyway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm after googling that im gonna say youre probably right the bigger box also has a handle my friend and i were speculating that it would be something drugrelated so i guess we werent too far off thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,while their origins might have been different in the and they saw a resurgence as stash boxes you could find cheap new made ones at any headshop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it says 木斯佳 im pretty sure thats for a name google tells me its the name of a writer maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the large character usually signifies the surname in chinese names this comes before the given name so it should read 佳木斯 jia mu si sounds like a phonetic translation of james but i think it is referring to the city of httpsenwikipediaorgwikijiamusi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a seal and its quite possibly a rendition of james as you can order them in your own name
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a stamp to make an impression in a wax seal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i bought one pretty much identical in china years ago or so box closes the same way with the little white thing you give them your name and they carve out the seal for you seals were a big thing in ancient china we bought it as a curio they were kinda used as your signature i cant remember if korea or japan still used them for official purposes in modern times
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a shield bug edit yeah
whatisthisthing,not_removed,context please is it a button whats on the back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be seal for sealing envelopes and stuff looks more like horse shoe than omega but theres no nail holes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,too small to be a horse shoe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its an omega i believe its referring to jesus the alpha and omega probably a good luck charm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure it appears to be something you would place on a tie more like a push pin this was given to me as a hand me down from my swedish ancestry i will take a picture of the back later today
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah very nice didnt think about omega
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not a peace sign its a yin yang symbol the eight bar symbols each represent a principal of reality httpsenwikipediaorgwikibagua

whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly a fuse of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey i was about to post this same thing thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,valve core goes ninside the stem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,specifically its a schrader valve
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it was missing youd know immediately as the tire would not inflate this is probably just a spare that felt out of their pockets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if this wasnt in the tire stem then the tire could hold zero air ya the mechanic probably had a few in his pockets while he was at work

whatisthisthing,not_removed,what upugnaciously said probably a gift so it would probably be sweetheart jewelry its very collectible and popular i have sold many pieces of it dont clean it just wash with dish detergent and water dry well you might get a few dollars for it but i have sold pieces ranging from to its an unusual piece rings are not common sizes would be an issue as not many ppl know the ring size of their sweetheart mother sister etc it could be for a service person but it is pretty tiny neat piece

whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes it definitely looks like these especially the top one found here i believe we can mark this as solved thank you again as to where i found them my mother in law has them and they were passed down to her from her grandmother who did a lot of travelling in her youth to places like thailand bali indonesia and china i can only assume she obtained them on such travels

whatisthisthing,not_removed,how does it even remotely look like a camera
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was being generous to op who asked found this camera looking device on the side of a building in my city any clue what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would be my guess could be some type of research into building movement construction law that dictated a permanent survey or unwanted building movement being monitored
whatisthisthing,not_removed,permanent mount for long term project instead of temp mount daily on a tripod

whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre cocktail picks like you would use for spearing olives in a martini my grandfather had a very similar set with elephants on top rather than camels
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahhh thats amazing thank you i should have noted that he was not only a judge but an alcoholic im leaving this one open though for a minute do you or anyone else know if these were traditionally made like this in the usa or perhaps were usually imported or bought overseas the inclusion of exotic animals ie camelselephants and very very similar designs as i see now when googling camel cocktail picks suggests these were something of a internationallyinspired fad at some point im curious when that fad occurred and where these might have come from or if faux ivory knockoff versions were also in vogue produced domestically

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i really couldnt say my grandfather wasnt a big traveller so im sure he didnt get his overseas generally barware seemed to be a huge thing in the late and so im sure all kinds was imported and reproduced

whatisthisthing,not_removed,so the tunicate reminds me of which we often call sea pork around here especially when it washes up on the beach the tubes are from some sort of polychate worm likely a species of looks like both the tunicate and the worms attached themselves to the same object
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah okay then its likely there were either or hanging out in the tubes andor the spaces between the tubesother stuff which is pretty common

whatisthisthing,not_removed,upper left could be some sort of wonton or fried tofu below that bean curd fried vegetables possibly plate with grass is some sort of fish the pink stuff on the center plate is pickled ginger bowl is maybe an egg and some type of broth

whatisthisthing,not_removed,for some reason my text did not show up i took this picture months ago when i was studying abroad in japan i am scrapbooking my experience and i want to finally id everything i ate during my first traditional japanese breakfast if it helps i ate this in akita city akita prefecture i have identified everything except for the two dishes on the left the lower left one is namasu i think but it looks different than a lot of the pictures that google has it had pickled carrots radish and some sort of seafood squid the upper left dish i have no idea about they were some sort of dumpling served cold wrapped in some sort of leaf like material the inside i have no idea if it was meat or not but it had a mashed potato like consistency thank you for your help in advance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so helpful im shocked at your brilliant identifying skills
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yay you helped me finally id that weird grey stuff thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wish that pink stuff was pickled ginger its cod roe

whatisthisthing,not_removed,or some reason my text did not show up you can have text or you can have picturesa link you cant have both thats a reddit thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you it took me years of intensive training sadly i specialised in something other than the japanese kitchen so i cannot help you with the other dishes hopefully someone else can if you ever have similar questions on the dutch kitchen or fruit give me a shout
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looking again i think you are completely correct thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,alright im pretty new at posting and not lurking

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think we got it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the reason it is open on one end is as it is being used up the plunger is pushing the stopper to the other side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah my moms diabetic so ive seen a few different types not saying it couldnt double as a crack pipe but i think youd want to remove the rubber bits first
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think it is an insulin cartridge im a diabetic and ive used different kinds of insulin pens for years and cartridges would only be a single tube the picture seems to show two tubes connected which wouldnt make sense for an insulin pen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was confused by the second tube as well but its just a ring on the persons finger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah thank you now i see the ring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rwhatsthisbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe its a spiders eggsack

whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its not in the blinds or anything my brother thinks its a nest of some sort but im at college and hes prone to being dramatic so idk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had one of those is right its a vacuum
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looking at the spikes on the bottom i believe its designed to vibrate and just sort of waddle about on a flat surface with no greater purpose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a tiny table vacuum for crumbs i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be an electric lint remover popular in the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gosh i loved mine even tried to fix it when it died
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it doesnt vibrate or anything makes a whirring noise that makes the dog want to kill it and blows air out the sides maybe some sort of desk fan
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be but i dont see any other ones with brushes it looks like they all have a little metal grate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,close its a mini vacuumsweeper for desks and table tops
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol you still use reddit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh wow it sucks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup not as much as i used to but ill still log on to check on simple planes or ask a question every now and then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eyyyyy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i recognize it its from some animated show or movie i thinkdid some googling but couldnt figure it out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a craft fair find any markings on the bottom is it solid or hollow are the wings detachable how big is it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when were you a kid maybe it was a knockoff of the httpwwwkrystoniascomhistorycfm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,guys i am sorry there is actually a marking on it i dont know how i missed it other than being a dumbdumb it reads vernon its made of solid wood except the wings which are separate pieces that are glued in its about a foot long here are more pics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like puff the magic dragon to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dragon tales
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its about a foot long the wings are glued in but the rest is one solid piece of wood it actually does have a marking on it i was mistaken there is a stamp on the side of the tail that reads vernon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow those look really similar thank you im so this would have been in the mid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your local arts council may have some info you may have the opportunity to do some detective work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,found in a thrift store it looks egyptian its about inches tall and a bit heavy dont have a scale to get its actual weight but it feels heavier than it looks the design looks similar to a nagaland bracelet that we googled but we dont know if its related or not i guess per that bracelet it may not be egyptian
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks to me like a spike like piece for the top of a helmet timeframe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed the general feel of it is very much african to me but unfortunately my knowledge beyond basics in african art is terrible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,either that or southeastern india bastar people

whatisthisthing,not_removed,perfect thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,extra data they are heavy chromed steel about to long the ball is screwed but fixed somehow the middle nut is screwed also but fixed the bottom nut is removable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look like drawer pulls to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some sort of machine tool handle they look like rifle bolt handles but those are usually a forged part of the bolt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are tooling balls used for aligning machine tools google tooling balls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is a picture of a lug mounted into the socket that receives it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how big are they
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hot and cold faucet handles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is almost certainly a machine tool handle source i have something similar on my lathe the ball and bottom nut may not be fixed it could just stuck from years of gunk accumulation they may screw into a threaded hole on a tool or if the bottom nut comes off may pass through a hole and then another ball goes on like on a vise this is a of a much bigger example but there is a little one on the side of most bench vises to allow their position to be changed probably wont figure out exactly what it goes to but i think it is something like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could you elaborate what are they used for the ones i find online are not like mines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be of course with my grandpa being dead there is no way to confirm this except with an old photo of a drawer but good guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i read drawer as dwarf and i was very confused
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont think so hand wheel handles would not be shaped like that they are either cylindrical or kind of tear drop shaped i know that sounds like splitting hairs but im pretty sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think a machine tool handle would be directly screwed and not have a bolt securing it but i dont know crap so it could be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at thats gonna be one huge gas strut
whatisthisthing,not_removed,about cm there is more data in the image description in imgur
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well that looks pretty good i replied to another user that if it is a machine handle there would be no use for the nuts and thats confirmed with the picture you link ill wait for a couple more responses before i solve it thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i know what youre referring to doesnt rule it out but this is the more common shape
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok then theyre not jewelry i have no idea sorry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn it writing solved in the middle of the reply also marked it as solved anyway machine tool handle it is then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,glad to help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im scared to google that

whatisthisthing,not_removed,picture of the statue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how can i confirm whether its antique or not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is a test to determine if its before the nuclear age but that only proves if its from before these things were so reproduced that its almost guaranteed to be a reproduction look at it if it was made for the imperial court it would have been properly polished its still got the sand casting texture on it this surely would have been polished away if it was genuine displeasing an emperor could mean death it wouldnt have been submitted to the court like this it may well be an antique but its not what the stamp on the bottom says it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,genuine antiques are usually purchased from government shops over there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is the end with rubber totally plugged or is it just capped if capped it may be a sleeve for swaging cable

whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure its a cigarette snuffer thats the cheap kind ive seen them in all sorts of colors at the dollar store the one in your image cant find an exact link with google but just search for cigarette snuffer and youll find lots of similar ones it just puts out your cigarette safely and instantly instead of mashing it into the ashtray or onto the floor the rubber bit is probably to get grubstains off your fingers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like its made from anodized aluminium if that helps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its sorta like a metal wall to say flat with the rest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its made of metal so probably not

whatisthisthing,not_removed,here is an example of another style
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look an awful lot like the horse teeth ive found on the shore of the thames apparently throwing dead horses in the river was common practice back in the day however im betting your cat isnt super small so i guess its not a horse edit omg my first time im so happy ps these horse teeth are large af super cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,horse teeth httpwwwvivocolostateeduhbookspathphysdigestionpregastrichorsepagehtml not sure why they would be washing up now though a single skull could have teeth how many have you seen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like buffalo teeth i was doing a project recently that involved teeth and the buffalo teeth i ordered looked like this i guess cow teeth would look more or less the same

whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep probably horse thanks they are quite common in farms around my town there are a few wild groups too i didnt know their teeth could be so big
whatisthisthing,not_removed,must have been some type of horse massacre
whatisthisthing,not_removed,likely solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i find horse teeth just about every spring turning over the garden there is no way those are horse teeth they look similar but are easily five to seven times larger than any horse tooth ive ever seen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they seems to check out i looked at other photos online they whole denture can account for all the different shapes and sizes i found i guess there is a dead horse being eaten slowly somewhere in the sea maybe thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what kind of whale has teeth like that they look like teeth from a cow or horse or some other grazing animal none of the whale teeth google finds for me look similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mastodon are usually more wide than long

whatisthisthing,not_removed,horse teeth can be very large see for example the images in this thread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah well these are fossils
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are mammoth or elephant mastodon teeth have prominent bumps like breasts mastodon literally means breast tooth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its all good my place was a farm from the to the i think were my garden is situated was the site of several horse burials

whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thanks for the info

whatisthisthing,not_removed,here are some closer pics that show the reflection of the lead i am sure its an original also a pic from the back side where you can see dents from dark spots on drawing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is nothing besides google being weird it is a round patch of actual satellite images of the water the rest of the water around it is just googles ocean floor map which is colored blue and does not consist out of satellite images if you zoom in you can see waves in that circle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some employee at google maps was responsible for coloring in blue where there is water they were using a tool like photoshop they had an erase tool and single mouse clicked with a round brush at that location what you are is the photo image of the gulf coast water with fake blue color layered on top of the map and an erased hole revealing ocean water again if you zoom in closer you can see the waves enjoy your weekend on the beach also there is the blue hole in belize this hole is real and real big i went diving in it a couple of years ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fwiw it isnt there in bing maps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you see this spot in person or just a google view can you bee more specific where it is so we can look it up with google earth really looks like nothing too perfectly round and big

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i always thought they were chopstick rests not spoon rests
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there a manufacturers mark
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aka knife rest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no but they are a part of a quimper set
whatisthisthing,not_removed,strictly speaking quimper is faience that was manufactured in quimper france i think this was made elsewhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,may i ask why i believe you btw i am out of my depth with this stuff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,stuff made in quimper had it own provincial style the vieux rouen décor was used by manufacturers all over france but the manufacturers in desvres produced huge amounts of items in this style also the color of the underlying stoneware is not right for quimper but it is about right for stuff made in desvres

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i imagine it may be part of a replica mace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,highly unlikely it could be shot from a cannon whatever it is the spikes would need to fit inside the bore and then there wouldnt be much of a seal between the ball and the inside of the cannon so it wouldnt go far
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the spikes are iron
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a mine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be some form of anchor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,found it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,had a replica mace that had almost exact same shitty spikes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could use a sabot but i dont see the benefit of a spiked ball from a canon though launching a cluster of these with a catapult or trebuchet at sails or maybe under tires might be useful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i assume you mean anchor who would make an anchor so small and out of wood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i hadnt thought of a sabot that might work indeed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post please try rwhatsthisbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i got these glasses from a couple who were moving overseas and they had gotten them apparently from an antiques dealer but had no real information about them they are approximately tall cobalt glass silver art decoish decorative rims and absolutely no markings of any kind whatsoever could anyone possibly give me a lead on a maker date anything to go on when trying to track down replacements the set is incomplete and some of the glasses have chipped rims i really like them and would like to have a complete useable set
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cobalt glass like that was popular in the late the rings make me think you can see some similar glasses and the only way to know the maker would be to either have a mark on the bottoms of the glasses that could be identified or accidentally find the same glasses with an identification unfortunately your chances of finding the same glasses even if you knew exactly who made them are small
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre very right sadly by the markings im fairly sure about them being from the i found matching glasses of a different type water glasses i think at an antique stall about eight years ago but unfortunately i lost the notes the seller gave me about the provenance of the glasses so help me rwhatisthisthing youre my only hope
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well if the stamp is to be believed then thats gold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like runestone symbols but nothing i can find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i figured that part out i just cant make out the writing i dont even know which is up or down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to the left it could be a b as in our bluetooth rune top center looks to be the sig rune and thats all i can do at a glance will investigate further but it will have to wait
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just read that signet rings imprint things so they are backwards still cant figure out what it would be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be used on wax seals drop some candle wax on a folded paper press the ring into the wax early form of security so the receiver of a sealed letter knew no one else had read what was inside also an early form of a notary stamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you think it is too individualized to figure out who it belonged to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could also use playdough instead of wax
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a question i cannot answer i wouldnt even begin to know how or where to find that information
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or just flip the photo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i mean httpimgurcomawflkp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it could be the base of an antique cast iron box stoveminus the legs one of many online edit i believe it came from a stove identical to this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it is made of plastic its likely a cover that goes under a car to keep water and airflow out of the engine area the indentation looks like it fits over the oil pan
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that has to be it it was made of cast iron

whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a plumbing nut are you positive it came from your car it looks like part of a brass compression fitting for copper water line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with the lip it looks a lot like a compression fitting nut but its almost impossible for those to fall off you sure it fell off the car and you just didnt run over it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a hoseline fitting see anything leaking out check fluidsanything empty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think you ran over it it bounced up got hung up in your undercarriage and fell out in your driveway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have a good idea what it is though i dont see how you could have lost it on your car it is the compression nut for some type of hydrolic hose like power steering on the threaded side of the ringed end you would have a barbed hose fitting sticking outward but held in by its own rim a high pressure hose that is steel reinforced is then forced down onto the barbs and clamped with a collar to hold it on the two rims spin against each other and act as a swivel for tightening and loosening the hose without twisting it these type hoses are on any and all hydrolic construction equipment high pressure up to past lbs the only thing your cars have even near this is the high pressure hose for the power steering box and if that would have came off and blew the fitting apart you would definitely have heard it had steering fluid all over the driveway and under your hood and lost power steering immediately definite hydrolic hose nut hope it helps moreso hope it solves this as to where it came from who knowscars pick up things off the road all the time thats where you get flat tires from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it is brass or copper it is definitely not from your car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like the fitting from a trans cooler that is integrated into the radiator like in the bottom of this image they are sometimes held on with plumbing style compression fittings an aftermarket replacement radiator has those in place but if your car is not an automatic those fittings are left unused and could conceivably rattle off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also check end of drive shaft
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would take a look at your tie rods aarms and cv axles but i agree with others very doubtful it came from your car as it looks like a locking nut and unless you cleaned it really well it would likely be covered in dirty grease crud even on the threads edit nvm what i said i can see the lip now and none of the parts i listed should have that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well here is where it gets tricky but i dont see how it can be from anything but my car i came home from work parked in the garage and went back out to check the mail thats when i saw it sitting half way up the driveway which is pretty steep and standing on its side what are the odds eh the other car in the garage my mothers hasnt moved in over a week and i cant imagine anyone else needing to park up on our driveway recently
whatisthisthing,not_removed,didnt see any leaks no radiator fluid looked a little muddy but i think thats an aging issues not a loose fitting cause at least the fluid is still there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would be funny as long as i know its not going to result in actual damage to my car then ill be fine but id like to know why such a large nut suddenly dropped off hell even the bolts holding the frame together are like of this things size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think i have any way to check that myself because the car is so low and i have no jacks however i do have to take it to a shop in a couple days for a separate issue so ill ask them about that thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have any tradesmen over to the house recently those things are perfect for falling out of the truck or van
whatisthisthing,not_removed,muddy like yellow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no look in the middle of the wheel and check for a nut in the center of each
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it didnt come off any drive train or suspension part it is far too thin as others have said it is most likely from a hose fitting which isnt on your car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope thought about that but at least no visitors that were aware of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,like redbrown light brown imagine if there was a rainstorm and afterwords when there puddles of mud water laying around it looks like that im going to get it flushed in a couple days to see if its just an age issues havent really done that in at least years maybe and if now will have to investigate further but i feel convinced that the radiator mud issue is separate from this nut
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you talking about the axle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,meek good though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that should be the control box for a pump you may has city sewers but if your house sits lower than the sewer this pump pushes it up to the city sewer you might have a plastic lid in your yard or basement you can open it and take a photo just dont touch anything in there im in that business seen of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is part of your house below grade lower than the surrounding area looks like a setup for a sump pump alarm goes off if the level in the sump gets too high
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we had one of these at the strip club i used to manage and it was a septic alarm when we had it checked the guy who serviced it said the level was fine but the filter was clogged with tampons causing it to back up and set the alarm off until it drained past the clog thus the intermittent alarm gnarley
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i do not have a septic system but could it be something to do with the municipal system maybe a pump of some sort it says not to open it so im taking caution
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its for a well i had mine go off recently because the water level got too low as long as it doesnt continue youll be fine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its already been said but that is a alarm panel for a sewer lift station if your house is below grade of the sewer system it pumps it up if the light is on or the alarm is sounding it means your poo is close to overflowing because the pump has stopped working i have seen so many of these fail in my line of work i would personally never own a house with a lift station
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have solar pv panels
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool does this mean i should phone someone or is it pumping stuff out and should be ok
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you may not have a septic system but maybe you just have a holding tank theres a town near me where no one has a septic tank or sewage they all have holding tanks that have alarms when they need to be emptied the town has a few trucks that go around sucking them out periodically
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was actually a loose wire in the control box which meant it was not turning the pump on the alarm went off when it filled to the threshold got it fixed and all working now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope i do not have solar pv panels
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the on the shit we were all wondering
whatisthisthing,not_removed,glad you found it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where is this photo youre suppose to take
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it was just a one time deal i wouldnt sweat it is there anything outside your house that looks like an inground tank there would be a connection to it from this box if you have a basement that would be another place to look
whatisthisthing,not_removed,should be fine if it goes off again you might not want to be near the sewage backflow yuck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was actually a loose wire in the control box which meant it was not turning the pump on the alarm went off when it filled to the threshold got it fixed and all working now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op delivered thanks for the update
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it found it but its bolted closed unfortunately got a guy coming at to have a look at thing thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is unrelated but goddamn op you took one highres picture nice job i can even read the label on the cord
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i read the label too not sure why
whatisthisthing,not_removed,droid turbo if you wanted to know awesome camera
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but why would someone lie on the internet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,old metal bouy a similar thing was just posted albeit in the woods
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sort of looks like a crane hook ball does it have any other holes in it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was it heavy or light if hollow it is probably a buoy if it was solid and very heavy its probably a crane hook weight or similar just by the picture and the fact its up on the beach and not half buried im guessing a hollow buoy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youre right about it being an old metal buoy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it had another hole on the bottom i think it went right through
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i thought it couldve been at first
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was heavy and seemed fairly solid i think youre right though i think it was an old metal buoy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,way too small to be a wrecking ball one of httpiimgurcommzaubjpg i dont think thats what it is though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it was heavy and solid its not a buoy my guess its the weight that hangs on the end of a crane cable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i honestly think its a rusted metal bouy ucrightonator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably what it is considering its on a beach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like the magnet from a magnetic name tag id tag edit source i come from a family of teachers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,small cocaine mirror maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have one of these tags its actually the plate that the magnet the piece you put under your shirt is attracted to its grooved to help stick to the fabric
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yore right i guess i put that wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is totally right someone is running around nameless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an adapter for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i feel so old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably one of these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so heres the skinny on these things regular records have the little hole but rpm records have a big hole because that made it easier to build a changer for them like in a jukebox the spindle could be conical and if the record landed in remotely the right place it would slide down perfectly most record players came with a little doohickey to put on the spindle to play a but it was easily lost also if you had a changer at home it wasnt likely the kind where it would take the record back off and put another one on it would just drop down one on top of the next you stacked them up on top of a little tab that stuck out of the spindle this was not compatible with the big hole in the again there was an adapter that came with the changer but they were often hot garbage that type of changer was never very good to begin with hard to get the records to stay and also easily lost looked vaguely like a cigarette lighter the good ones were fully round but most changers came with the rectangular kind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an adapter for a rpm record album so it can be played on a rpm player
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually it is also a httpsenwikipediaorgwikitriskelion coincidence
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont feel old records ive been listening to are awesome and all from those years youre golden
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this post hurts last night i didnt get carded at a bar i even offered it and the guy said naw youre good
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hear ya
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ohh thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how does that work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i too wonder how it works
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also if memory serves it was also the endofarticle graphic for spin magazine but they obviously chose it because you know spin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aw shucks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i will normally card ladies even though they look way old enough makes the tips better and them feel good back fired one night though she didnt have an id and since i asked and the rule is no matter your age you need an id i had to refuse service
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have a bigger hole in the middle that albums have a hole about as big as a half dollar coin and albums have a hole about the size of a pencil the adapter fits in the hole of the and allows both types to be played on the same spindle the adapter has nothing to do with converting the turntable speed the turntable had a switch that you could toggle for rpm or rpm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the answer is above
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i bet you just blew some minds with that one haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that happened to me last year on my birthday remembered it for got a sitter and everything then couldnt find my id anywhere decided to go anyway — no go i do look really young i have a year old and the amount of people whove thought he was my older brother is ridiculous but still that first time i didnt get carded stung a little
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for pulling staples the top part is the sharper of the two you slide it under the stale and push down it rocks on the protruding parts on top and levers the staple out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some other information passed on from my aunt it is solid metal the handle does not move in any way one side of the tip is a blade still sharp too and the other side is slightly thicker and blunt no sharp edges at all and we have no idea what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a can opener
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for scoring marking or cutting something a fixed distance from the edge leather or woodworking come to mind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,beside the hole thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heres a guess someone mounted a backup camera backwards to be able to keep an eye on a young kid riding in a rearfacing car seat if that really is a hole in the rear windshield perhaps they cut it out in order to make the camera image clearer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,car windows aside from the front windshield are made of tempered glass which busts into thousands of tiny pieces you cant make holes in them after they have been made they either come with holes like a car door glass where it attaches to the track inside the door not all cars some are glued in maybe all are glued these days but when i worked doing auto glass replacement it was common or they dont
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats is some craaazy dedication if thats the case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say these pretty much solve it both plausible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks exactly like this russo google shows maybe its a model but you might google around a bit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you so much i think that is it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seaglass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like its from the bottom of a glass bottle the r doesnt look like any glass manufacturers mark which is kinda like a logo that im familiar with im guessing its the companys code for the specific manufacturing plant that made it or perhaps the specific glass mold its hard to be sure but it looks like theres a fairly even bumpy pattern thats faded after tumbling around in the ocean for several years that would be stippling and it means the bottle was made after more than that i cannot tell you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is that part of a raised letter to the left of the r oclock position
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an httpsenwikipediaorgwikiantlion larva caution to the squeamish close up maybe someone over at rwhatsthisbug can get it closer to species level no reason why it should be with your passion fruit they build usually
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a lacewing larva closely related to antlions they stick debris on their bodies as camouflage which seems to be whats happening here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an ant lion edit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to add the passion fruit are from kenya im in scotland he looks like mould and has like a kind of tail legs and what looks like pincer mouth parts kinda reminds me of a hermit crab type thing yeah so any ideas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,god damn that closeup is nasty looking is that sand on it or does it normally look like that jesus if i was an ant i would shit myself to death if one of those caught me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i used to play with these as a kid fed them ants had no idea that they were a larval stage of anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you could try asking at raskreddit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres another one probably about feet away from it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a ceiling wifi extender
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow thanks so you know what its use is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i stand corrected nailed it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,controls the lights it turns the lights on when it detects someone entering range and keeps the lights on as long as it detects some type of movement during a set time period it can also be used to control heatingair conditioning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what do you mean closer to one side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a desk or sideboard table with trestle legs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the style is traditionally called a but i have never seen one not made only from wood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a modern take on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,x trestle table
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i may be seeing it wrong but the table seems like its lopsided as in extending farther toward the wall side of the metal pieces that run parallel to its width
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont side boards typically have storage underneath ps happy cake day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also called a farmhouse table sometimes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,strictly speaking yes but manufactures have taken to using sideboard to mean any table like piece of furniture that is meant to be put against the wall oh and it is my cake day huh thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a painters combination tool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree it is an old the inwardrounded edge you use to scrape down rollers to get all the paint out and the other edges you can scrape stuff with or open cans with etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sometimes referred to as a in tool this version looks like it is foldable and has a quick thumb opener
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill call that solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i really like this subreddit it is new to me and i enjoy it a lot but do folks not know about google image search
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,honest answer its the key used to to open a simple lock on a guitarcase
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks lol im pretty new to guitar so there ya go lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some sort of sea lice or similiar parasite probably ate it or was the host for them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it could be fishing bait in the shape of a tadpole looks like a hook was in one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any more information is it bony rubbery plastic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some kind of spiny fin was it a catfish by chance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tuna or similar predator fish those are part of the skeleton
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think theyre fish bones of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably a cute zipper pull for a midrange purse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i think its a purse dangly too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also guessing its from a purseclutch or maybe keyring looks like a bag charm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,purely decorative bow tie that fell off something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like the decoration off a betsey johnson bag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,purse decoration from a kate spade knockoff or maybe a betsy johnson
whatisthisthing,not_removed,out of curiosity what makes you say midrange
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cheap ones wont have that sort of pleather and expensive ones wont have that cheap kind of metal bits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that makes sense thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the remains of chicken farm a bit north west of there are what looks like greenhouses by a lake i found old picture of a poultry farm in that area and it sure looks smiliar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks more like a cafo so you got the concentration part right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes totally
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i grew up next to a chicken farm and it looked just like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,buddy of mine bought a refurbished computer found these inside anyone know what they are description large green pill mm hit on one side line through the obverse small orangish pill dct on one side blank on obverse tanpurplish oval pill mtl on one side on obverse piece of a white pill no idea of its markers appears to have some imprinted squares powdery stuff grainy white rodlike stuff that isnt the same as the white pill i googled the phone number and found with the same korean text i cant read it it is clearly a drug thing and not a silicon package for keeping the computer dry like my friend originally thought hah edit the storefront link isnt working i found it searching the phone number on google images you can probably still see it there but the link is way too slow which is why i had posted a link straight to the image
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol google says true love pharmacy as the translation of the name on the bag if i had to assume the best id say those are glucose drops as merchandise i used to get them in pharmacies in germany far away from korea i know when i was a kid the little text above just says cut at this line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how did you get the translation btw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually so far i have discovered that in korea it isnt uncommon for pharmacies to package doses individually this way until moments ago ive never seen that before but none of these pills show up on the pill id websites and even googling their markings is fruitless the mtl looks like a morphine tablet except that i cant find anything about the mtl marking so it still could be just about anything the fact that they were inside the computer suggests it was being purposely hidden thats why im so curious what they are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres a google translate app for android i have to read japanese and chinese occasionally and the app has character recognition brilliant when you encounter something you have not seen before i just took a picture of the photo and it showed me transcript translation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hm i didnt know that but having this info i would assume its the daily dose of a mixture of whatever the previous owner had to take explains the half pill the grainy bit looks like the innards of a capsule would be impossible to find that particular substance without a chemical analysis
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i only found out about that packaging when i googled korean pill bags youll find a lot of except different pills of course i guess they have different generic drug companies there because the pill id sites dont show anything at all for mtl mm hit or dct even the addiction sites dont have these although thats where i saw a morphine pill that looks similar to the mtl one edit also i think you are right about pill innards these grainy things are odd and they dont look like the kind of thing silicon packages usually have for keeping things dry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay im currently wading through httpswwwdruginfocokridentyidentyresultaspx with my rudimentary knowledge of korean and a lot of google translate mtl is apparently corydalis extract result is not latin mm hit says scopolia extract clear dct it says pinaverium bromide also clear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome now i can sleep without thinking about it the fellow must have had gut cramps very weird to find these inside a computer obviously not hidden but it isnt a typical drug cabinet for something so benign
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thailand baht coin edit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,works as a £ coin in uk vending machines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a physalis
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiphysalis
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a cape gooseberry not just a gooseberry they look different green and without the leafy sheath
whatisthisthing,not_removed,worked as a waiter at a restaurant that served these on desserts you had to be real careful when people asked what it was called its real easy to accidentally say syphilis
whatisthisthing,not_removed,peruvian ground cherry or more commonly called the golden berry im a chef so i know lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a gooseberry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tomatillo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,loved those as a kid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,peruvian ground cherry or more commonly called the golden berry im a chef so i know lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seconded also nicknamed love in a cage in french
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a girl at work always brings these in i misheard her the first time she told me what they were so now theyre forever called syphillis in our office
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved damn that was pretty quick thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive always called them goose berries
whatisthisthing,not_removed,like most things they have different names depending on where you are eg cantaloupe is a rockmelon where i am
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cape gooseberry a gooseberry is a different fruit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,indian gooseberry because it doesnt look like a regular gooseberry to me at all indian gooseberry also happens to align with the physalis answer elsewhere as they appear to be synonyms if im not mistaken
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you that was super quick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,close its a cousin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in austria they often put these things on chocolate cake super tart flavor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikigooseberry edit but apparently cape gooseberry is a thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bows i was legit just browsing the new section at the right time i guess xd but yeah if you get a chance plant the seeds they grow loads of those once they hit the fruiting stage p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i was thinking just throw a couple of them in a pot and hope it works ive also read some varieties are hallucinogenic so yay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,none that ive eaten but im sure if you eat the wild and slightly poisonous ones then that could happen lol they be green when ripe and somewhat slimy but chances are they dont grow nearby but yeah just chuck em in a small pot or container and keep them watered like once or twice every few days and in medium sunlight and they should come out nicely
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the gooseberries my mom used to grow were green and super sour she would make pie with them but it took a pile of sugar to make it good
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not found on your picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rwhatsthisbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just inherited these from my grandmother trying to see what brand these are if that is possible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,check the bottom cavity for a stamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just checked it says ll wmc not sure the exact model trying to figure thay out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from ll wmc loevskyloevsky white metal castings it was a company situated in new jersey the company was closed in the late they used to assembled many different patterns and styles of lamps theres no other stamp maybe obscured that indicates the model
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there was one but it was really worn out all i can get from it is a and a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,xpost to rwhatsthisworth theyve been refurbished but theyre still antiques
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks a ton i will do that now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say its worth but im not an expert
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rwhatsthisworth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the blade looks like damascus or wootz steel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a httpsenwikipediaorgwikikirpan an article of faith in the sikh religion that sikhs must wear on them at all times edit it could also be a httpsenwikipediaorgwikijanbiya
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pattern welded steel and is likely made with junk steel as is common from the region camel bone is common and used for all of these knives the blade itself is subpar it isnt terrible for fifty bucks but it is decorative
whatisthisthing,not_removed,about half of the creature is not visible as it is below the tracks there was a small tuft of blonde fur on it and the whole skeleton was probably about or feet long it was a pretty big animal im thinking it was probably some poor deer but im not certain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,please tell me that you are not handling this with your bare hands
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like deer from the size and shape of the rib cage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ha definitely not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cant really see well but could it be a shock to a car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solid metal piece with honeycomb machined boxes filled said sulfer smelling substance was originally in one piece before i knocked some of the corrosion off update neighbor called the police and they have identified it as a potentially explosive object the bomb squad about police cars and a historical expert from another county in ct is coming to try to identify it fun stuff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,originally in one piece before i knocked some of the corrosion off if that thing is an explosive today would be a great day to go buy a lottery ticket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,update
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah knocked that off this morning before i went to work and put it up on a stone wall came back around and told the rents about it and they decided to do the proper thing and call the authorities every day is a great day for a lottery ticket until its not but yeah i thought it was a crank shaft or something semiprecious due to its weight ive done some research and they did munitions testing in the lis for wwii guessing its something related or these guys are just trying to get some sweet overtime on our dime
whatisthisthing,not_removed,still down there with the thing under a flood light i guess the guy had to get out of his pajamas to come take a look at it i guess regulation states they arent able to move the object until it has been identified by this dude from another county small town and local pd is clueless saying things like this could be a homeland security test of our emergency preparedness tactics and years ago wed be flicking matches at this thing to see if it blew up decided to leave and grab and beer and jam with friends they said theyd keep us updated and let us know what they discover ill pass the same courtesy on to yall one could only assume that since theyve had the private beach quarantined for this long its gotta be something seminifty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hear anything about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rabbits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there anything above it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hares
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rabbit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,water droplets from melting ice on a tree branch above
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no it was this morning so its a giant shadow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking that it mightve been drips from something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hungarian rings
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a holder for cell phones and other gadgets you lift up the elastic things and stick the corners of the phone under it didnt really seem that practical to me when i got one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what cell said like this gridit organizer black
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a widget designed to give the beer the right amount of head when opened
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it was a guinness then it delivered nitrogen into the beer by opening when you opened the can the pressure inside the can kept the ball from opening until the can was opened
whatisthisthing,not_removed,guinness is actually better out of the can than the bottle because of this i wanna go back to the factory in dublin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also known as the winner of the queens award for technological achievement in beating the internet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved that is very smart
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kilkenny also uses this system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes it was indeed a guinnes it also has a number inside any idea what that might be for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bloody queen how dare she downplay the greatest meme generator in the last years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hard to say without holding it probably amber or citrine doubtfully mother of pearl has the flash of it but looks more like its just shine from underneath or just glass too is always an option
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all suggestions so far are possible as is anything from polished quartz to plastic with a metallic backing if the band is sterling it might be worth taking to a jeweler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does the marking on the band help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry it cant really be identified from a photo as it could be several things the ring seems of quite lowcost construction so its likely not something very valuable id lightly tap it against my teeth to see if it feels more like plastic or glass if it feels like plastic then its likely to be amber or plastic if it feels like glass then it could be citrine quartz garnet coloured glass or something else pretty unscientific i know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does this extra pic help at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,honestly these kind of rings are a dime a dozen im willing to bet by construction it is indeed silver just looks right but the rings are really only worth in the dollar range resale wise anyways but yeah really hard to tell from picture im betting on some form of amber personally from the amount of them ive had
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for the stone no but if it helps you thats the mark of wheeler manufacturing company and yes its sterling silver they are an anglo company that make and made a lot of southwest style jewelry id say it also makes it slightly more likely to be amber as that is more often incorporated into that type of work than citrine and similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unfortunately about the same that company did use gemstones like citrine as well so it could be anything i listed and many i didnt too although im still leaning towards probably amber or citrine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just meant that a jeweler would be better able to id the stone because they can weigh it and shine a light through it etc i dont expect it to have much in the way of value if the band isnt marked then theres no point because its defiantly paste of some kind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eh not necessarily and it looks heavily worn anyways plenty of time marks are lost in wearresizing even if its not that old but yeah youre certainly right a jeweler can or any local jewelry dealers really give a better idea in person edit no matter op posted mark picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,makes me think of something to hold a stack of paper plates
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a ford fairlane similar to the australian model below httpsenmwikipediaorgwikifordfairlaneaustralia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe is correct for more detail i would suggest going to rnamethatcar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are we sure its not a of some kind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that seems to be it odd since i found it on a british coachbuilders website although maybe theyve imported them for this purpose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its definitely a hearse on the page i found it on its listed as a ford cardinal im wondering what car its based on though in your link its clearly a ford scorpio but in mine i cant find any similar ford road car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i getcha now their hearse really looks like a transit van
whatisthisthing,not_removed,regarding your nowdeleted comment i found this image on the same site on this listing the dorchester name seems to be by the coachbuilder however no idea what this name comes from since the australian fairlane from the parent comment is the babf edition of the car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,another thing this coachbuilder seems to like importing from australia upon second look the looks to be based on the httpsenwikipediaorgwikifordfalconfg from australia even though i initially thought it was a mondeo based on the latter photo maybe australian fords suit themselves better to stretching
whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha i deleted it because i didnt read your description right and realized i was telling you everything you already knew bahaha yeah it seems like the name might be the coachbuilders model youre right itd be nice if they listed the platform its built on so you can research it more
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id be interested in knowing whats the deal with aussie fords
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a mile marker that helps them find locations on buried pipelines if you were thinking about excavating under it i recommend against it that location is mileskilometersfurlongs away from some established survey point gas companies typically do aerial patrols of their right of ways either with fixed wing aircraft or helicopters theyre big brightly colored and canted upward so theyre easy to see from the sky proof
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if theyre not these then a google image search for selby hinges might have a picture you recognize
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely hinges
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like hinges for a toy box
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a john newcombe tennis shirt the mustache logo was his trademark
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry the smaller picture is so poor but there isnt really anything complex about the logo to need a superquality picture this shirt was found in a bunch of band tshirts i found when picking a house in exeter new hampshire shirt feels as if its a cottonpoly blend
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is to hold the kor stones which is an inspirational affirmation you see every time you open the bottle for a drink wow i was not expecting that when i started searching
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the lid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you are awesome how random thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it doesnt do anything the lid is where the hange is this rubber piece just sits in the recessed piece below the handle it comes out very easily like its not meant to stay in place which if it had no purpose theyd probably tack it down with adhesive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly a rock that had water falling on that one spot for a long time grinding stone maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have one too it has a little circular hole about of the way through try xposting to rgeology tell them its basalt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this could possibly be an unfinished net weight canoe anchor my dad has several finished ones and they look extremely similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe try rarchaeology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when stones like these are found theyre usually labeled nutcracking stones whether it can be proven or not however it is interesting to note that the word pecan is from the algonquin a tribe from the great lakes area pacane which means nut that needs to be cracked with a stone it actually describes any nut that is too tough to open bare handed not just pecans so at least theres a possibility however these divoted stones are common in lake superior common enough to be collected and sold as on etsy that means its natural
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its natural just a really pretty eroded rock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a water worn piece of basalt i have a cabin on lake superior and we find similar stones on our beach we always look for weird and interesting wear patterns ive never seen one exactly like yours though very cool we use the larger ones for rocks in our sauna
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but its not basalt it looks like a sandstone my best guess is that you are looking at a weathering phenomenon the little lump in the center may be a small sphere of rock with a slightly different mineral cement than the rest of the rock this can happen where theres a bit of organic material that changes the local geochemistry as it decomposes the rock weathered down to that more resistant lump
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is raised at the bottom of the hole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed that it looks like weathering
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is basalt i have a place on lake superior and we have many of these on the beach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have no other info really about it nobody knew where she got this it looks like a workable pipe except for the cup its written india on the black plastic cup anyone has a clue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rpipetobacco

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the tail of a mayfly larva the last thing they do before they fly away is shed this tailleg sheath

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think they are similar to cams for furniture like that from ikea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for you info it says разб сбор лидо ie razb sbor lido they must be shorts for words i dont know in russian judging from the arrow its probably lockunlock openclose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just a special screw like the right one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some kind of broken knob or snapoff lid russian markings surprisingly found in an old car park in france n°s over the slit are and different on every part ate my banana at lunch hence vball for scale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you must be right i expected something like a snapoff safety on a gas canister or something but it fits now why would there be some russian furniture parts in the gravel of the car park of an old religious eldrely home were the nuns actually kgb officers secretly assembling cruise missiles under the pretence of nursing old people the plot thickens anyway id rather wait beford marking as solved just in case someone can translate the cyryllic writings

whatisthisthing,not_removed,last one is the mini usb cable specifically for charging controllers but can be used for other things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and are some old cell phones data cable i used to have a phone that used it but i cant remember what it was edit it is for one of the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,number looks remarkably similar to the usbkodak cable that came with my kodak easyshare digital camera i bought in around ive been tricked a few times trying plug into other micro usb devices
whatisthisthing,not_removed,usb to micro usbor maybe usb to printer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks that one is going to the trash right away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks that might actually be it there used to be a underneath the television but its not mini usb though thats a different connector
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they arent one has a corner keyed and one is even smaller than micro usb heres a comparison i took a micro usb cable and showed that as well so you can see it is different also i just found out one of the cables is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it may work with a samsung camcorder too i have a little white one and im pretty sure it had a connector like that gold plated connected to a tv
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is the rear dogbone link off a suzuki hayabusa maybe other models im not sure see its what connects the bottom of the rear shock to the frame of the motorcycle if someone lost that they are probably having a very bad day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at first glance it looks like the crank from a peddle bike
whatisthisthing,not_removed,holy shit this sub never ceases to impress me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved awesome thanks a bunch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow i knew it was a dogbone but knowing the exact bike is impressive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to be fair i didnt know it off the top of my head i just recognized it as a dogbone and googled dogbone or something similar till i wound up at the ebay auction i linked as well as a few others i looked at to make sure it wasnt a weird coincidence
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you google what is written on it because its a desiccant to remove moisture and keep the pills dry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,absorbs moisture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,silica gel pod to absorb moisture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,drying agent which absorbs moisture

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i actually just found this myself while google searching i couldnt believe it thank you will mark this post solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heyyy thanks for the credit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would think its to prevent someone from pushing a cart or some kind of furniture right up against the wall at that point and blocking the flow of air through the vent if hot air comes through that vent it might also prevent the cart or its contents from being damaged by the heat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,either a simple handrail or it might be meant to keep people from leaning on the grating and damaging it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,depending on the height probably a handrail available at hardware stores
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id say a support rail if its inside but looks like it could be used to hold plant pots if its outside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its about foot high much higher than a cart or trolley
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more pictures would help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i assume you mean the thing bolted to the top of the traffic sign camera maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hot tip for those attempting to diagnose and repair their own dodgy home appliances partscom i dont have any interest in the company whatsoever but that site has saved me many repair dollars and expensive replacements the oe diagrams are a goddamned godsend when your washerdryerdishwasherrefrigerator throws a figurative shoe you can often directly order the part and fix it yourself with those when your at least a tiny bit handy or determined good luck op i hope you can fix it yourself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess you would call it the agitator seal gasket oring etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,specifically where that rubber gasket thing is in the middle that is connected to the tub btw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks like the drive coupler or whatever its called there shouldnt be water there i dont think check for a catch basket leading to the water pump its likely plugged hence the leak
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have the exact same repair job to do on my washer it looks like the tub seal after reading about how to replace it it seems like its going to be a bit of a pain in the ass to replace but way cheaper than a new washer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good luck with that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,went there and looks strictly for car parts only
whatisthisthing,not_removed,am i stupid why does this site only sell car parts when i look
whatisthisthing,not_removed,came here to say that know your make and model
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tub seal maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most likely that is the motor that spins and agitates the rubberplastic thing in between the motor and the basket is called the coupler it is a piece that is designed to break instead of the hardware itself if the washer still spins most likely that isnt where it is leaking from unless there is a crack somewhere in the agitator and water is getting in that way at least if this is an upright style washer is the water leaking before its full or does it happen later on when its running
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it is the tub seal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwappliancepartscom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my bad been awhile since ive used it check for sears parts direct and other like sites seems theres a few more out there now that have the parts diagrams know your make and model and you can find a world of parts out there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mounting stemtub seal or transmission seal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe its happens while its running and washing clothes it spins fine just leaks just did a quick search myself and came across something called a tub seal could that be it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it side loading or upright if upright to me it sounds like the springs on your basin might be worn out and when it is off balance the water could be spilling out of the basin that way

whatisthisthing,not_removed,something of you i really cant see it clearly enough can you capture each bit seperately
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good idea op might try to amplify the white with a black light
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe it doesnt help but who knows
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the date looks like it could be nov
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is not a family piece this was picked up from an estate sale two days ago i do not know the details of the ancestry of the family to which it belonged
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you mods for reinstating this post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree hey httpswwwredditcomuserorlitoq can you get us a shot with better lighting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most certainly a cooling fan likely off of a truck or tractor motor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this was found on some property in kentucky that used to be a farm its about in diameter and relatively heavy maybe or lbs im thinking its part of a farm implement that would have been attached to a tractor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would a cooling fan be that heavy this thing weighs about or lbs and the metal is a lot thicker and more rigid than any cooling fan ive seen admittedly ive not seen them all edited there was strip mining in the area as well could some heavy equipment have had a cooling fan that stout
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes they are often attached to a centrifugal clutch or something similar so that when the engine slows the fan doesnt right away improving cooling capability
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok that sounds reasonable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are all reaper dark heaven minis which have been painted the first one is stern kestrelmen the second one is from dire wolves the third one is oksana spring magius the fourth one is osvick strick i cant tell enough about the unpainted one in the background to identify it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like dd miniatures do they feel like they are made of lead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the square base on the figure in the far back makes me think whfb do you have a better shot of it

whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill take one when i get home
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here you go
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this guy is really throwing me for a loop i thought maybe he was an old chaos sorcerer or mordheim chaos cultist but i cant find him i tried looking through reapers figure finder and darkswords search engine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so what are these figures actually for are they board game pieces worth anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre used for paper and dice roleplaying games or pen paper rpgs alternatively the warlord figures can be used for reapers skirmishlevel wargame called warlord most tabletop wargamers play warhammer kings of war infinity warmachine or hordes theyre worth about to a piece new if they were professionally painted httpwwwputtyandpaintcom theyd be worth to a piece from what ive seen on ebay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess is a kind of press in case you like your burgers properly smashed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe used for unsticking edges or bottom of something cooked in flat dish with an edgepicture like a deep dish pizzayou would need to detach from side before slicing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not a potato masher its for packing vegetables into canning jars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe a or though the one you linked doesnt look as practical
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im pretty sure thats for lifting mason jars from boiling water during the canning process
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im pretty sure its just a vintage from back before they were just a weird bent wire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be just a bookstop edit thank you i can see the handle now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved uweighed has said vintage potato masher i believe hes correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe for lifting more than flipping like getting pickles out of a barrel or something like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some sort of smasher this is very similar minus the slots
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a bean masher that looks like this except it is slotted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,masher of the potato
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats not a flipper obvious design flaws would tell you that its not for pulling things out of anything as the handle is too close to the flat part for that to be hygienic more than likely its a placer and given the shape probably a placer for delicate cookies similiar shaped food item either removing it from heat or placing it there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or halfsmashed if youre using this thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really source
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe for cookiesized items
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wouldnt lift a boiling hot glass jar with that theres nothing to stop it from sliding off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been canning since i was a kid and have never seen anyone use anything but tongs or a basket to remove cans from the pressure cooker can you post a link to a similar device thats listed for such a purpose if not im going to say youre just making a wild guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really ive always used tongs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youve nailed it a couple people have guessed masher and i think vintage potato masher is the best guess im going to have to say solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that example supports the business end on two sides mashing potatoes with ops would quickly bend it out of shape
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was wondering why you were at zero when i came to say the same thing but on closer inspection theres actually a big handle on the top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone please explain why cant it be a bookend and have a slotted handle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was trying to think of something like this where you would need to lift up something but a pair of tongs is so much easier so i dont see anyone getting this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be i also found items exactly like the one you listed which are called inox slotted spatula scoops but i havent been able to find anything non slotted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uweighed mentioned vintage potato masher i think you guys have it right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not understanding how this would be easier to use than a normal spatula for moving cookies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,halfsmashed thats the way i like to cook
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my grandmother had one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybei cant find one like it the degree angle is very odd
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its used in conjunction with a cloth or tongs just something to prop up the bottom so a jar doesnt slip and smash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is definitely a wildish guess my mother used one for that purpose but it could very well be for another purpose other than canning ive used potato mashers for the same effect
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its used in conjunction with a cloth or tongs just something to prop up the bottom so a jar doesnt slip and smash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,vintage potato masher surely bent wire is older than stainless steel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what about example
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh sh thank you i did not see that d
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because bookends dont need handles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a bookend should have low center of mass otherwise the books will topple it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its because you dont flip it off which would destroy something delicate you slide it off unto cookie sheet or plate i think this family of utensil this is a best guess btw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant find anything on google about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why not just use tongs also wouldnt that require an empty slot in the canning pot in order to maneuver this tool under the jar not saying youre wrong but not something i would ever use
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the holes make for less stress and that looks significantly reinforced compared to ops
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you lower the can into the water using this so its already in the water when its time to use it its very hard to pick up a wet can or bottle with tongs let alone a heavy bottle or can try it its honestly hard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess tongs can slip ive burnt myself that way from pickles before the heavier the jar the more dangerous the tong only method
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the exact same thing but solid you know what i dont care believe its whatever you want to believe it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its been a long time since i helped my mom with canning but it was pretty easy to do with the right mason jar tongs the wrong tongs can make it really hard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would require processing the batch without having the lid on also would lead to having the handle of the tool just as hot as the boiling water ive been canning for years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pssssshhhh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its very hard to pick up a wet can or bottle with tongs let alone a heavy bottle or can try it its honestly hard i do it all the time with a jar lifter not with food tongs totally secure and easy this thing would be terrifying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was a fine guess but i dont think the idea is standing up to scrutiny
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres special canning tongues that make lifting jars in and out of the water really easy i dont think this tool would be of any help lifting jars out of water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ops is a bent piece of flat thin metal your second example looks thicker and had some sort of reinforcement going on at the bend no need to get dramatic about it though im merely voicing an argument for the sake of collective brainstorming not trying to say youre definitely wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know what ass downvoted you but those are exactly the right tongs for lifting a mason jar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not getting dramatic i just dont care and if i had to say id say ops actually looks like a much thickerstronger stainless steel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was actually quite strong and rigid would have been easy to mash some potatoes that were soft from being boiled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was downvoted for the hideously long link im sure of it im glad you got the point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i still believe youre correct the metal was quite thick and strong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i see in that case with the example provided id agree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,farmer here definitely a grain separatorseed cleaner we have a box on top to dump your product and it gets shaken down through a screen on that pieceprobably drops chaff out the back then down the slopped wood part where its shaken and blown to further clean the grainseed the roller in front looks like it had a conveyor on it to pull the cleaned seedgrain out of the machine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the two fans make it look like a grain separator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it might be a grain cleaner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is an old corngrain sheller here is one similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,old corn shucker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it next to a silo if in a highly agricultural area ill also go with some kind of grain separator or even a corn sheller i suppose that its also possible that its some kind of sluice for gold panning too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i say its a feather remover seems similar to the one mike rowe used on a episode of dirty jobs where he was pulling the feathersdown off of geese and ducks for pillows
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rhome tx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this i think sorts seeds by size and blows the chaff out those fan shrouds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a httpwebstanfordedusiegelregyptscarabsjpg i dont think the hieroglyphics say anything with some variations
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perhaps the cleverest ones of all are the counterfeiters an ingenious old fellah farmer in qurna named mataani made clever copies of pharaonic scarabs from limestone and faience he then fed the scarabs to his flock of geese whose stomach enzymes aged the scarabs years if so interesting but gross
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a couple of these from the valley of the kings carved from different local stones like jade basalt etc as far as i know the glyphs dont say anything in particular but they did supposedly carve mine and my sos name onto the top in hieroglyphs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,strange indeed like someone else said they might be more common than we think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i feel like this thing must exist somewhere but after hours of googling ive turned up nothing that matches it i want to buy one of these bracket systems and use it on a hybrid sittingstanding desk which should have about an maximum load the female part part i should be significantly longer than the male part part ii the desk will be around feet deep so some torque needs to be accounted for in planning the load i can handle that part though im not entirely sure this belongs here but i havent been able to get an answer anywhere else if anyone knows how i can get my hands on this thing id greatly appreciate it

whatisthisthing,not_removed,the things with logos are the primers you can see on the edge of each one theres a dent where the firing pin hit the primer setting off the charge the other side was probably crimped tightly over the gunpowder charge the firing pin hits the primer which is designed to create a small explosion when hit like that the small explosion sets off the gunpowder in the larger crimped pocket which blows open the crimping and blows the nail into the wood my dad had a similar setup for driving nails into concrete to hold the footer board in place on the concrete floor when building a wall in our basement if im remembering correctly sidenote there are rim fire and center fire cartridges for bullets you can see these are rim fire since the dent is by the rim
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it gous something like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,essentially you are driving a nail into concrete with a cal blank
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes except its not actually an explosive its just a release of highpressure gas contrary to popular belief modern gunpowder is not explosive at all it simply burns very quickly so in a normal cartridge the proper term for a single round of ammunition what you might incorrectly call a bullet the firing pin of the gun hits the primer which causes a spark this spark causes the gunpowder to ignite which creates a large volume of gas that forces a hunk of metal the actual bullet out of the cartridge through the barrel and out of the gun in a nail gun the bullet is simply replaced with a nail and its not part of the cartridge itself so the gunpowder ignites rapidly creates a high pressure and that pressure is channeled through the gun and into the head of a nail which is driven out of a plastic strip at high speed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiexplosivematerial just gonna throw this in here and copy pasta of most relevant bit below low explosives low explosives are compounds where the rate of decomposition proceeds through the material at less than the speed of sound the decomposition is propagated by a flame front deflagration which travels much more slowly through the explosive material than a shock wave of a high explosive under normal conditions low explosives undergo deflagration at rates that vary from a few centimetres per second to approximately metres per second it is possible for them to deflagrate very quickly producing an effect similar to a detonation this can happen under higher pressure or temperature which usually occurs when ignited in a confined space a low explosive is usually a mixture of a combustible substance and an oxidant that decomposes rapidly deflagration however they burn more slowly than a high explosive which has an extremely fast burn rate low explosives are normally employed as propellants included in this group are petroleum products such as propane and gasoline gunpowder both black and smokeless and light pyrotechnics such as flares and fireworks but can replace high explosives in certain applications see gas pressure blasting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes except its not actually an explosive its just a release of highpressure gas contrary to popular belief modern gunpowder is not explosive at all it simply burns very quickly this is completely incorrect gunpowder is an explosive and that release of high pressure gas is just fancy talk for explosion granted gunpowder is not a high explosive it deflagrates instead of detonates but the whole reason we have the term high explosive in the first place is to distinguish them from low explosives like gunpowder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre arguing semantics it is considered a propellant not an explosive they are classified as explosives politically for easier categorization in terms of regulation but as you said they work by means of a different process httpsenwikipediaorgwikismokelesspowder smokeless powders are classified as typically division explosives under the un recommendations on the transportation of dangerous goods – model regulations regional regulations such as adr and national regulations such the united states atf however they are used as solid propellants in normal use they undergo deflagration rather than detonation it is a very different process compared to traditional black powder i have seen the difference myself a pile of smokeless powder when lit simply burns very quickly a similar pile of black powder goes boom or more accurately fwoooff one of the first things you learn when you start hand loading ammunition is that smokeless powder is a propellant not an explosive like black powder by your definition wood is just a very low explosive thats just silly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre arguing semantics i find it amusing that youd call me out for arguing semantics given that you started it by correcting someone elses semantics in any case you are correct that it is merely a matter of definition and while the official definition counts smokeless powder as an explosive it certainly does not burn as quickly as black powder and thus there is room for disagreement so i will concede the point and not argue further the point about wood is interesting wood in bulk does not undergo deflagration it merely burns and thus you are arguing with a straw man but very fine sawdust dispersed in air does deflagrate see dust explosion so under proper circumstances yes wood can easily create an explosion powerful enough to level buildings and no im not arguing that we should call wood an explosive i was just making an interesting point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre actually

whatisthisthing,not_removed,an animal in the wild is more than capable of taking care of itself dont and make things worse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like it might be a garter snake either way it looks nonvenomous having worked as a wildlife rehabber i can tell you that a lot of the time the best thing you can do for an animal is leave it alone just because you think it needs help doesnt mean that it really does
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikigartersnake it wont hurt you just leave it alone and let go on its way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is either a valley garter snake or a mountain garter snake they are both adapted for cold winters we had a mountain garter snake by our mountain cabin for years same snake in an area the gets hard freezes cold climate garter snakes can hibernate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in cold weather the snake may get cold and become torpid but it will probably be ok when it warms up unless its on the road or somewhere its going to be killed youll probably do it more harm than good by disturbing it take me in tender woman
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i really admire and appreciate your willingness to help little dude if he needed it yay for you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it wont hurt you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rule of thumb when it comes to snakes for future reference if it has an angular head like an arrow then it has fangs and avoid it if its head is more rounded then you should be good another is to look at its eyes if you can see them venomous snakes have pupils like cats or slits none venomous have rounded pupils like humans now im not sure this applies to all snakes but i believe it does to most
whatisthisthing,not_removed,california striped racer looks to me httpwwwcaliforniaherpscomsnakesimagesmllateralismojpg from httpwwwcaliforniaherpscomsnakespagescllateralishtml ive seen them in the sierra foothills not far from where you saw this one and with others agree they can survive just fine if you saw it when it was cold outside remember they are cold blooded so do slow down and will hibernate for the winter where it is cold enough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and this is why i asked i am not good with snakes but i was a bit worried about the dudedudette
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it slithered away after gaining enough strength it was really slow when i first saw it i thought it was already dead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes cold blooded animals go into torpor in cold temps which means that their biological processes slow down and they get sluggish but this doesnt kill them its just how they have adapted to deal with weather changes no worries op i do think its sweet that you are worried about the little snakeling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ya like the lamb in alaska that tried to get away from all the people that were crowding it so it jumped in the bay and drown
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reptiles slow down when theyre cold because cold blooded perfectly normal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so i jumped in the bay and drown i guess you got better

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive never seen one of those and i have seen many era daggers from all kinds of nations around the globe my best guess is that it is a hand madelocal made souvenir dagger for a member of the marine artillerie navy artillery which manned the coastal guns in the normandy the sheath and the crossguard of the blade show signs of being hand made and lack the uniform look of mass produced daggers the lack of manufacturers marks on the blade also indicates a small scale production in a small shop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a kriegsmarinenavy dagger tons of variants but the link posted below shows a lot of good examples
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably seasoned older guy most likely pow not dead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant help you date or name the dagger but this be careful how you store it it looks like you have some pitting on the blade dont store it in the sheath where it might accumulate moisture an airtight display box would be nice wipe the carbon steel blade with any quality oil from time to time and you can will the beautiful knife to your grandkids and let them fight over it simple ways to stop the rust on the knife bladeforumscom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,once during a dd session a friend said that looting bodies for treasure was unrealistic to how real people behave

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this may be a stupid question but have you had a look around for the missing pommel it may not have been identified as having come from the dagger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might wanna try posting to a subreddit like rmilitariacollecting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you tried over in rswords
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont have a whole lot of backstory on this the story from my american grandpa was that he pulled this off a dead german soldier days after dday in france we always wondered about its origin so ive taken it to both an antiques dealer who said it was a souvenir or novelty not a real weapon which i have a hard time believing and a military weaponry guy who admitted he is more trained in american civil war than european and neither had many answers ive searched the anchor all over the internet and cant seem to find an exact match any help would be greatly appreciated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the two eyelets suggest it would be a mounted officers blade and very possibly dress uniform it may be a ceremonial form of the knife used to put a wounded horse out of its misery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we have a similar one with ingraving and it was said to be a letter opener for officers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could have come from the eastern europe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for what its worth near the end of the war the germans were scraping the bottom of the barrel when it came to knives guns helmets ammo you name it ive heard of and seen some oddball examples of stuff carried by german soldiers this to me seems like either something a german soldier was gifted honor for something prestige blade for an officer was issued the government finding any and every bladed implement they could issue to the soldiers even if it seemed inappropriate for the time and place or something the german himself looted i wish i could tell you more on its origin clearly european seems contemporary to when it was found likely german but could be french very likely associated with a navy though again that certainly does not mean it was a sailor your grandpa found good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when outside ostrov far west russia some locals showed me rifles etc salvaged off the germans duringafter the war i even got to fire one of the restored rifles with an original bullet found alongside it i was wearing a rammstein shirt at the time so i was shitting myself a little when they came out of the cabin with a rifle fascinating experience though then we drank rose tea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op mark this as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am not an expert about german daggers i know enough that its not any military pre or during war issue the daggers during the war most people know the look of pre war examples look really different more like fancy hunting knives generally with atleast some inscription on the blade still would be a cool piece of history to own
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,be mindful if you ever travel with that ivory hilt plenty of situations where that could be confiscated leaving you with no recourse at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its not a real weapon wouldnt taking it from a dead soldier be a crime
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not that i care so much since the dead guy was a nazi but iswas it actually legal to take things from a fallen soldier
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the extent of my knowledge comes from what ive seen in films and tv but that doesnt look like something that a normal german soilder would have on him more like something that would be carried by an officer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed the anchors are signs it was a navy man the hilt appears to be made of ivory and yeah its definitely hand made
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you on antiques roadshow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the info would explain why after about a decade of random internet searching that id never seen an exact match
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any idea what it could be worth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive gotten confirmation from wwiidaggerscom that this is for sure not german im going to hunt down the marine artillerie angle next
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow this is the first time ive seen this many daggersdirks that look so similar to mine im going to reach out to this guy and send him the pictures of mine and see if he can help identify it thank you ill update when i hear back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,per the response i got from the guy from wwiidaggerscom he is certain this is not german but definitely european
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the info its been in the sheath since he got it so well take it out of that ill also get some oil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not an official german thing being german yes it is its just not a kriegsmarine thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your friend has lived a very sheltered life havent they
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if by real people he meant the kind of people who would never want to fight in a war then sure i could see that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but it was more common in wwii times
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i feel the same way ive always just wanted to know more about the history of it but i am very happy just to have it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,posting there now thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im posting there now thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,who said it was a souvenir or novelty not a real weapon which i have a hard time believing it most certainly was not a real weapon a ceremonial one at best especially the ivory hilt is too brittle for prolonged use as you can see by the crack it has
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks ceremonial but also older than wwii like late turn of the century maybe even older thinking either carried as a talismangood luck from homeold country or simply gathered up from a local town way too ornamental for being military issue even ceremonial in the modern era
whatisthisthing,not_removed,half the war items posted here are like that loot people picked through dead bodies for things to bring home in both world wars laws be damned youre welcome to have a moral objection to it but the time for hindsight is over
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looting corpses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think you can judge if you werent there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is generally accepted as falling within the realm of spoils of war
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how do you know he was
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also looking at the symbols on it it could be naval a quick google search of naval dagger brings up a lot of simmelar looking daggers with the same symbols
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wrap it up boys well never figure it outunless you know a guy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope but id love to be on a show like that right now im just a guy with a lot of knowledge about otherwise useless stuff so if there are any producers out there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the other guys link has a nearly identical one for not sure if its a real antique or not though edit it appears to be an or so antique dagger the imperial model naval dirk with shortened scabbard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,worth someones life apparently
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is hard to say because by the looks of it it is a one of a kind dagger without any references to base the worth on it is probably not worthless considering the handmade look of it and the fine engravings on the sheath but it will likely not score prices in the thousands like legit military daggers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,update heres the response from wwiidaggerscom thanks a lot for the interesting email and the pictures of the dagger passed down from your grandfather i have never seen a dagger like this but i can tell you for sure that it is not german it is definitely a naval dagger and appears european i took a look in several of my reference books and i can not find another example so i am out of sources if you find out the pedigree of this dagger in the future i would be interested in knowing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the kaiserliche marine officers had some leeway in deciding on their dagger and these things often were custommade or customized as long as certain specifications were met standardized daggers only became a thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if a sentenced starts with a dd session you know its a sheltered life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant readily see which part of that page your referencing but it appears that taken arms from the enemy is allowed just not taking personal property in general
whatisthisthing,not_removed,his argument wasnt legal based his argument was that people looting dead bodies after killing said bodies was immoral and real people wouldnt be able to do such a thing therefor looting in dd should be an evil act and make our alignments change
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you trying to make a point a joke either way i dont know what you mean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a long way from pulling gold teeth sort of thing desecration of corpses more like dumpster diving in a messed up this is war sort of way id bet its always happened and always will peace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well as far as i know taking personal items like a watch jewelry from dead soldiers is a crime
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just checked the wikipedia article on spoils of war actually not legal but seemed to be a common thingthx for the answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the title kinda says so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i also did that search but cant find the exact same anchor thats on this id also assume navy but id like to know which one and the era id have to guess it was old even in the maybe made in the midlate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you were then youd know times what their hacks know that do the analysis in those actual events they only use the knowledgeable people on the show for certain items to be broadcast for tv the rest of their appraisers are pretty lame
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wwiidaggerscom nice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,update i actually contacted the guy from this site he says it is not german so now i know what its not still dont know what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,given that it was taken from a german soldier looks like he died for the promise of that sweet sweet liebensraum
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the closest other daggers are the and the ive already checked all other european countries to rule out the captured dagger aspect
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah but this thing isnt arms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the point being that the looting of corpses and taking of war trophies while outlawed was a very common thing for our grandparents and great grandparents to do during a lot of this loot involves things that had very personal and deep meaning to the families of the dead soldiers and now that the greatest generation is passing on and the items are moving down the linage more and more people are trying to return the property to its rightful owners family where it will have meaning again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes from the wounded and sick as well as the infirm and expectant mothers shall be the object of particular protection and respect as far as military considerations allow each party to the conflict shall facilitate the steps taken to search for the killed and wounded to assist the shipwrecked and other persons exposed to grave danger and to protect them against pillage and illtreatment no protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited pillage is prohibited reprisals against protected persons and their property are prohibited grave breaches to which the preceding article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts if committed against persons or property protected by the present convention wilful killing torture or inhuman treatment including biological experiments wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a protected person compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile power or wilfully depriving a protected person of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in the present convention taking of hostages and extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly edit added emphasis of pillaging
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is unclear to me why people are downvoting you even hours after i replied with verification from the geneva convention ops grandpa taking an ornamental knife from a dead german soldier would be considered a war crime if he did it today
whatisthisthing,not_removed,war is a crime
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youve clearly never played any video game looting corpses is kind of the point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a german soldier i dont see any mention of his political views
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it might also not even be german who is to say the german soilder hadnt taken it off of some one else

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved the folks on rswords also pointed me to austrohungarian and ive seen enough similarities between mine and their wwi daggers that im comfortable with this answer im gonna keep looking for a closer match to mine but at least i feel like im on the right path
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bang on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the first mention of pillaging there applies to shipwrecked not to corpses its unclear whether the appropriation of property applied to corpses but would be covered by military necessity clause
whatisthisthing,not_removed,meh hivemind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,meh hivemind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,meh hivemind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah that sounds really great and all but its a bit more complicated than that theres a reason why things like the httpsenwikipediaorgwikilawofwar exist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in most games you commit war crimes by the minute so thats not a good reference if that wasnt obvious to begin with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you trolling around alright maybe he was one of not sooo many german soldiers who were not nazisback to my question thouiswas it legal to take belongings from a fallen soldier
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everything i included was from and edit i think youre talking about also from the the presence of hordes of pillagers formerly called the hyenas of the battlefield may not be so common today but the possessions of the wounded and dead may well excite the greed of unscrupulous soldiers or civilians and incite them to pillage such acts are odious and must be prevented
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes and its not to protect ceremonial daggers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you are citing provisions about the rights of civilians the knife was taken from a soldier i was only referencing the text you posted there may be other authority which protects against the looting of soldiers corpses google isnt giving me a clear answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats not really on you or me to decide though is it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i see what youre saying i am no expert in the jurisprudence of this scenario my perhaps errant thought on the matter is that the possessions of the wounded and dead regardless of former service are not supposed to be screwed with except in the cases of military necessity ie no pillaging but disarming is ok given that the knife in question is said to be ornamental and not a practical weapon taking it is appropriation of the deads property it could be successfully argued that ops grandpa took it provisionally as a military necessity and then later realized it wasnt a military weapon but then he kept it personally it was perhaps a family heirloom that the dead soldiers desperate father not wanting his son to die in a stupid war had given him to wear for luck i know if somebody had rolled a family members corpse and stolen their personal possessions if those possessions are later found the family should have said possessions returned now we just wait while op decides what is the right thing to do with the ornamental knife ops grandfather stole from a mans corpse three days after dday
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with all due respect the law of war to which you refer do you really believe these things hold steadfast and true across the board when people are actively trying to kill each other like a guy blows a whistle or throws a flag and somehow the process of kill or be killed stops while the refs assess a penalty or something and decides if a law of war has been compromised often these thing are decided long after the deeds are done and its way too late for those who were victims happy memorial day in the us
whatisthisthing,not_removed,obviously but law is law no matter if when or how it is enforced people commit crimes all the time without being punished doesnt make them any less of a crime taking that dagger was most likely technically a crime but ops grandpa will obviously not be punished in any way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not by us we cant judge because we werent there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its one of those issues that opens up a bunch of philosophical cans of worms no real answer to any of it yes technically it may be a violation of some written law law is law as you say but irl ops grandpa was taking a war souvenir and thus stealing from the dead in combat it gets off in the weeds when certain distinctions are made as to what is legal to steal from the dead in combat only certain knives can be taken kind of shit yeah laws are broken every day with no punishment and some people say laws were made to be broken then there are those who say to live honestly one must live outside the law big can of never ending worms woody guthrie sums it up for me i love a good man outside the law just as much as i hate a bad man inside the law

whatisthisthing,not_removed,update clarification the circled parts are to show how it worksbut what im trying to figure out is the name of the entire part that clips onto the divider and then goes into the side holes mortise was mentioned but that seems to be only the name for the circled part in the bottom picturemeaning the pin would be the tenon im looking for a name for the entire tenon piece not just the pin that makes up the tenon i would use colors to describe the part but its all grey im focusing on is the plastic that includes where the arrow points and makes the v shape that clips to the divider ill try and take it apart tomorrow so i can get a picture of the specific part later today
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i ran out of time at work to get a picture but heres the part isolated from the background a good bit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have no idea what its called and i want to incorporate something similar into a cad design to do that i need to find it in libraries and i have not had any luck doing that with names that i could come up with knowing a use is not the same as knowing a name similarly just because you know that theres a part on the end of a shoelace that stops it from unwinding doesnt mean you know its called an aglet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i always heard of it in terms of a mortise and tenon as a permanent joint in woodworking if the tenon is the barpin do you have any suggestions on what the entire plastic piece would be where the tension of the bent plastic pushes the tenon in tension tenon flexible tenon doesnt seem to find me much on google images ill keep digging tomorrow but if you have more suggestions id appreciate it thanks

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking about this while sitting in my office chair and i noticed that under my chair i have my legs under my chair and have my right leg crossed over my left so my right leg is sitting kind of onabove my left achilles about the same spot as your picture do you ever sit like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you use a pant hanger something like this has happened to me i blame this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe the pull lever for the car hood or emergency brake knob in your car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when you ride your bike the chainring is grabbing your pants and tearing a hole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you have a dog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you cross your legs a lot when you sit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,guessing there was a security tag there that left snags and unraveled after a few washes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont even own anything other than sperrys and running shoes and ive never worn these on a bike
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its from using your right shoe to push off your left shoe through your pants when you get home
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope under my desk is pretty empty just a garbage can with no rough edges and i use a non swivel chair no car either yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep just left leg in the same spot im thinking it could be something jagged sticking out of a stair somewhere in my residence but then id expect the hole to get bigger over time too maybe ill keep my eye out for something on the stairs next time i go to the caf edit just went not seeing any cuts in the stairs plus theyre too small to hit with my shin anyway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sometimes i do but still i feel like that wouldnt make a cut the pants
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope always folded in a drawer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how would those cause a hole in your pants
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i only drive my dads car sometimes but i dont think anything brushes on my leg when i clutch plus hed probably have that same problem if there was something there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope just me in my dorm room
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes i do but i cant see how this would make a hole in them and in the other pair of pants khakis it looks more like a rip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,odd gremlins maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,check the sperry on the opposite side i had one of those metal eyelets pop out and dangle took me a few scratches on my leg before i caught on they are surprisingly sharp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn now im not so sure about my own pants
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there perhaps a nail or screw poking up in the drawer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might catch the top of the pant leg with the heel of your shoe as it crosses over
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the only explanation i cant disprove right now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems to be some type of weird tower
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be an ex attlong lines microwave tower
whatisthisthing,not_removed,open burial tower used by the zoroastrian community in detroit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen some odd weather stations with towers similar to this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,spotted in a small town in south dakota cant recall which edit solved the consensus between rwhatsthisthing and rsouthdakota is that its an old phone company microwave tower in yankton
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good eye
whatisthisthing,not_removed,missing the antenna horns
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rsouthdakota
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you took this with a phone it may have saved the location in the image meta tags
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doesnt mean it wasnt at some time in the past
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a good idea thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,alas no
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like some sort of holder for dvd cases the wire part pops upright and the plastic part slides forward to hold the cases like bookends the two sizes could be the lower tier for jewel cases and the upper tier for keep cases
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it holds cd and dvd cases on edge those bits at the end of each row stand upright to stop them from flopping out of the drawer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cavemen used to put their cd cases in these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,barnacles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely barnacles compare to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i never knew barnacles were so pretty inside the red and blue colours
whatisthisthing,not_removed,like they say you get old mushroom hunters and bold mushroom hunters but you dont get old bold mushroom hunters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,things you dont eat unless you are sure for please
whatisthisthing,not_removed,post to rmycology some mushrooms take a few weeks to kill you fyi your parents are morons you should seriously get a positive id asap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i posted this to rmycology for you because you didnt listen to other peoples recommendations to do so i would go ahead and terrify your parents with mushroom horror stories for next time same with twisty seashell horror stories because those httpmotherboardvicecomreadhowtheworldsdeadliestsnailkills
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you still kicking any side effects
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im uk so please check pores rather than gills indicate a bolete and the deadly ones are orange or red this may very well differ on another continent and spore prints are often used for good identification
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hedgehog mushrooms maybe httpsenwikipediaorgwikihydnumrepandum
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you get a pic of the bottom maybe honey mushrooms what environment did they find them in on a tree the ground etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i see pores instead of gills did they peel the caps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is their life insurance paid up to date
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are they dead yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your parents do not know the basic elements of mushroom id that would take them minutes to learn matsutake are close gilled mushrooms these in your picture are some kind of bolete i dont know enough to id these but they are very lucky that there are no fatally poisonous boletes tell your parents to buy a book about mushroom id before trying to forage for their own food again fyi the guidebook i use mushrooms demystified is over pages long and it is just for north america but there are definitely mushrooms out there that are very easy to id like chanterelles or puffballs and they should start there with beginner stuff not this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well op ate the mushrooms just wanted to say that it is so dangerous to eat unknown mushrooms had a family member dying in days from it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look to be oyster mushrooms which are edible but dont take my word for it amateur mushroom hunters shouldnt be eating their finds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah they know mushrooms can have poisonous lookalikes but my dad insists he used to eat these exact ones as a kid said theyre matsutake mushrooms were in floridado they exist here theyve actually already eaten them and just told me i can call if anything goes wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyve already eaten them ill let you know if it turns out to be poisonous
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look nothing like the oyster mushrooms we get where i work i dont know if there are different varieties
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like what what about these make you think theyre oysters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also ive convinced them not to eat any more mushrooms in the future but i get the feeling theyre only agreeing because they thought the mushrooms didnt taste very good
whatisthisthing,not_removed,last post its probably boletus barrowsii
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt bother because i felt like the one shitty pic i had wouldnt be enough to confirm anything since so many people were asking about the stemsundersidesetc but thanks i appreciate it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt eat any because im not suicidal my parents and their friends seem to be doing just fine though haha will update if something happens in a few days but i kinda doubt it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the only pic i have sorry theyve eaten them all by now i think they found it on the ground in the woods with the tall florida pine trees
whatisthisthing,not_removed,honey mushrooms are gilled and these ones are pored
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope still alive and kicking no mention of cramps or any other symptoms either
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the matsutake thing was actually a translation error because he told me it was something in chinese that google translate told me was matsutake but who knows what he was actually referring to anyways i agree it was dangerous and not worth it at all ive convinced them not to do this again in the future
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op said they did not the parents did
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely not oysters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oyster mushrooms are gilled these ones are pored
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can tell those look edible quote me on that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i seriously hope thats not how you identify or check for edibility
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from what i can tell the gun is unloaded but dont quote me on that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no so wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,google matsutake they look completely different
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah no way are they matsutake do not eat these its not worth it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you better update op hope nothing bad happens but im worried for your partners
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some mushrooms poison take over hours before symptoms by the time you feel sick your liver is already completely destroyed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,isnt this how the plauge in the last of us started
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well minutes have passed i assume theyd be in the hospital right now if the mushrooms were poisonous everything ok i also live in florida but havent seen those
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these ones in the picture are really old and gross and honestly were probably full of maggots
whatisthisthing,not_removed,boletus barrowsii
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well depending on what kind of mushroom this is in a few days it might be to late with some mushrooms the moment you start feeling symptoms your pretty much already dead i cant for the world of me understand what went in to your parents minds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant give you much better identification guess then without more pics were they picked separately or is it one growth like an oyster mushroom maybe these wwwmushroomexpertcomarmillariatabescenshtml your parents should buy a guide and research before they eat also learn to test foods for signs of toxicity before eating
whatisthisthing,not_removed,post them to rmycology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh god so there are a lot of mushrooms poisonings that happen when asian immigrants mistake the north american death cap mushroom amanita phalloides for this super popular edible asian paddystraw mushroom volvariella volvacea you can only tell them apart by doing a spore print and obviously the death cap amanita totally kills you in a really unpleasant way your parents had a really close call if they do stuff like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,huge difference there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from what i can tell the gun is unloaded but dont quote me on that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they seem fine for now will update in a few days too just for anyone still curious
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup they seem to be doing fine haha hope its not some slowacting poison
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty par for the course actually a few years ago they found mushrooms on some hill behind a restaurant and ate those too one year we were at the beach and they found some weird twisty little seashells and brought those home to eat as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,picked separately i think on the ground almost covered up by pine needles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yikes didnt know there was a specific poisonous look a like for that mushroom really seems like they did get lucky thanks for the info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe many poisonous mushrooms take days to show symptoms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also many mushrooms will combine with alcohol to create toxins suggest hours before imbibing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im sure they will be fine d mushrooms are just one of those scary things to guess with they can be so tricky to identify
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are they asian
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is how natural selection works
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not even kidding they all had whiskey after dinner jfc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yuup
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it plugs the hole while youre carrying the beverage and doubles as a stirring stick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to keep the coffee from spilling out as you carry it usually good for carrying multiple coffees as opposed to walking with just the one youre carrying and drinking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,keeps hot liquid from splashing out the sippy hole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also really good for scratching itchy ears
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved that was quick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its called a travel stick or splash stick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when companies dont want you doing your own repairs they make it hard for you you need hex head security bit you can buy them individually
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was going to say allenhex security bit it doesnt look star shaped like torx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a security allen to me but it could have been warn down you can take a screwdriver and knock that tit off if you dont care i run into these all the time and sometimes they just arent necessary can find the bits at harbor freight norther tool so its not like its super secure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tamper proof allen not torx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an allen wrench is the wrong tool for this job you want a torx security bit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why is this marked spoiler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,great thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ace hardware carries a screwdriver bit set with just about every bit known to man including the torx tamper proof screws for just under bought this set years ago and use it just about every day havent stripped or broken a bit yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ubobsterbain please mark the post solved httpwwwredditcomrwhatisthisthingwikimarkapostnocss if you have any bother doing so reply to me and ill mark the post solved for you also please do not delete your post as other people might find it useful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is correct its not a torx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a security allen head note the flat sides some joker tried to force in a torx in there though based on the marring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ummdeveloper got it its a wind turbine hub
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks and id say it was roughly the size of a small car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a pocket watch tag that goes at the end of the chain you have to anchor it to a button and the other end goes to the watch so you dont drop it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,urussrobo is right its called a valet keychainkeyringits just missing a couple parts and is slightly damaged it is essentially a quick release to remove some of your keys from the main keyring the name i presume comes from the practice of taking off your car key to give to the valet driver with a similar mechanism
whatisthisthing,not_removed,keychain breakaway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,roach clip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a pair of tweezers that doubles as a flat head screwdriver maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its to replace golf
whatisthisthing,not_removed,broken detachable keychain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perhaps it was sentimental the one object looks like a womans earring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was he a pipe smoker could be a reamer to clean the bowl
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have one of those as well found it in my front yard always wondered what is was
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tuning fork
whatisthisthing,not_removed,little tweezers for a keychain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an sd card reader
whatisthisthing,not_removed,livelongprosper your friends grandfather was spock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im still trying to figure out how this workswhat it does
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think so this looks like monogrammed a snapapart valet keychain to me these were common as gifts notice that both halves have loops unlike a pocket watch fob when these two parts are assembled the end of the inner part snaps through the cutout on the side of the outer shell this forms the button which one would press to unlatch the halves and pull them apart again the second ring has been bent open probably to get keys off of it and looks more like a hook now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and we have a winner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking roach clip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no it is not the item in the image that op supplied is far to small
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought was a divot tool as well i havent seen one exactly like ops but not all divot tools are made the same also i dont know why your comment is controversial its just as legitimate as the top ones e im on board with the pocket watch answer now still shouldnt downvote sincere incorrect guesses that doesnt promote participation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a clip so that it stays at the top of your pocket or on a vest buttonhole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the end shown in the picture slips onto a button the other end is attached to a pocket watch buttonend stops watchend from meeting its groundend
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwpmtimecomhowtootherhtml looks like a button hook attachment maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so whats the monogrammed cover for and how does that stay on the button in the pics ive seen the hook to the left in this pic goes on the button
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i imagine the cover slips over the button and chain once its on so it has a more put together look
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats right the hook goes on the button and its held there by virtue of surface area i guess im also guessing that the cover is for storage and the monogramming is because it was a gift
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rtranslator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe someone here will know otherwise try rtranslator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like hanzi ucecikierk can you make this out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,社水 not a clue what its supposed to mean any context wherewhat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rtranslator or rtranslation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone suggested to me it was traditional chinese and may read something along the lines news publisher distributed or news publisher party but they werent sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its on an envelope dating from the to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the characters are brushed on an envelope with ink the envelope is from shanghai do the characters you wrote translate to water and agency 社水
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe its 社報派 as op said news publisher party
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what do you want to know if its markedyou know its silver then yeah its a silver ring its designed like a tiara marks can help with a company
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a friend of mine posted this picture of pigeons in belgium and were wondering how such a color can happen its not photoshopped
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why you didnt posted the original thread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you read one of the comments i think they sent it to a paranormal investigator for analysis and he wrote an article about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,googling the brand they make high qualityhigh security mechanicalelectronic door locks httpwwwmultlockcomensitemultlockproductskeyplatformsmechanicalkeyplatformsinteractive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,multlock good key control and reasonably pick resistant they make cylinders that fit many other lock brand mechanisms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the college i work at uses keys nearly identical to that for the dorm keys they charge if you lose it because theyre pretty expensive to replace apparently
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a key for a lock where the pins are running perpendicular to the blade of the key instead of parallel to it the black bits may be a key component to open the lock that prevents picking its just a different style of lock than the standard although typically a bit higher security and cost than average locks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,havent seen a key like that in years when i worked at an amusement park we called that the jesus key its a key to a high security reconfigurable lock either a padlock or door lock the jesus lock locked up the cigarettes and candy in the warehouse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just a normal key i used to have one just like it to my dorm room in college
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah this is the kind of key we had at my old job the locks werent anything special that i could see but my boss told me several times that he couldnt get copies made anymore
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the brand is multlock the type is some sort of dimple security lock looks like doublepin coaxial dimples to me source httpswwwyoutubecomuserbosnianbill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if someone put it on that pole it means they found it nearby and left it noticeably fit the owner to find i hope you left it there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they charge a lot for any key at most dormsapartments because if you lose it they have to replace the whole lock in case it falls in the wrong hands
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not sure but it looks like a hinge pin with a spring mechanism like for a door maybe a closet door or something edit its a hinge pin with a stop mechanism see ucanarchist comment below
whatisthisthing,not_removed,adjustable door stop with hinge pin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agree with above this is most likely a hinge pin designed to keep a door closed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i came here to say it looked like a punch the clips would hold a nailhead at the bottom so the long pin could strike it after reading the comments though i agree with the door hinge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a door closer it also helps to keep the door from slamming
whatisthisthing,not_removed,previous students probably took the door off to use as a beer pong table
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can confirm i drunkenly took apart my buddies door yesterday and put it back together with a pocket knife that looks just like one of the pieces i tinkered with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup we have them in our house way better than the springy things you screw into the baseboard httpiimgurcomxmciowajpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or to limit how far the door can swing open
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats hilarious i literally walked out of my room at am still hammered to grab a glass of water and when i walked back in my room it was in my hand no idea how it got there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so it only lets the door open a certain amount
whatisthisthing,not_removed,better cant twang them not better
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would disagree with that strongly eventually itll just rip the hinges off unless youre extra careful which kind of precludes the need for one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes absolutely could be a stop pin without being able to examine it wont know unless others can confirm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i miss college
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is correct the ones we have are adjustable at ° and ° i believe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that puts a high amount of shear force on the hinge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exactly why the spingythingies still exist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wind up torch or flashlight as you yanks call them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a stand to prop the meter up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right its actually a multimeter with battery added at the back side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in france pousse pieds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jesus christ you ate that thing man people are brave
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the french and the chinese eat everything under the sun
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow what did they taste like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you ate a barnacle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in spain we call them percebes and they taste delicious basically the animal is a penis itself so you ate a handful of penises also harvesting them in spain is quite dangerous since they grow among the rocks in the coast the waves hit the rocks and sometimes the percebeiros people who harvest them have accidents thats why they are so expensive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok so we know what they are and by the video how to eat them and what they taste like now how are they prepared orugggare they raw s
whatisthisthing,not_removed,percebes in spain i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like alligatorcrocodile feet good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank god thought they were turtle legs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can confirm although didnt realise these were edible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i want to know how he ate it it looks crunchy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,way back somebody was the first person to eat them either brave or starving or both
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those things are delicious believe me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hurr durr it looks icky grow up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the french cajuns seem to eat a lot of swamp creatures compared to other cuisines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chinese win this contest hands down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow what did they taste like apparently something between crab and razor clam oceany
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here in spain we steam them and theyre damn expensive to € per kg depending on size and season
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you and me both
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are considered an expensive delicacy and not easy to find in a restaurant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you dont eat the crunchy bits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a turtles legs to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at a cajun zoo the information card includes information about where the animals are from whether they are endangered and a few recipes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well they would have but hands are very delicious you see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and shredder too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,per kg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did he say it tastes a bit like pee pee
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whether they are endangered and a few recipes its endangered and goes well with butter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,anything that walks swims flies or crawls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive picked these in the broken island group on the west coast of vancouver island the reason why they are expensive is because they are difficult to harvest they just pop off the rocks with a knife but its dangerous terrain we literally risked our boat and our life to get into areas where they grow naturally to pick them dangerous water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,couldnt decipher it either i heard pippy but i cant imagine thats right either
whatisthisthing,not_removed,salty and a little bit sulphury
whatisthisthing,not_removed,anything with wings except airplanes anything with legs except tables and chairs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or slithers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the spanish go nuts for these i have seen all sorts of ridiculously expensive shellfish on spanish markets there are videos about the harvest on yt gordon ramsey did one too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pippis are a type of small musselclam
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he just looks like a guy that knows what pee pee tastes like har
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the ocean there are but two things food and sand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was staying in spain and saw these but they were green in the grocery they were labeled but my dictionary didnt have the word i asked people but my spanish is minimal and i couldnt understand their answers for six weeks i was obsessed what are those things what are they then i was at an outdoor festival and saw someone selling something i recognized from the tour books as fried barnacles because they were serving them in newspaper cones and there was a sign on the vendors stand and i recognized the word from the grocery store and put it together thats what barnacles look like nothing like the ones on the bottoms of us boats so i was pretty excited to see this whatisthisthing post here eta typo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,piss clams
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jerky boys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes but the term originated with old italians from new jersey
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is denver fire clay company they made chemical assay equipment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some lady was going to scrap this thing but i saved it she said it belong to a friend of hers who used to be a miner and the only writing it has on it is clay co denver fire its also reaaaaaly heavy and spins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved wow that was fast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,according to that it was used in conjunction with mercury quicksilver so may be worth taking appropriate precautions when handling in future
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so youre telling me i shouldnt use it to make my guacamole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its bacteria called s marcescens
whatisthisthing,not_removed,something kids classic maybe a clothing company logo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,edit cleaned of children comments here was i saw the word classic but thats all im ready to say after looking at all team and club crests and the fact the badge says enough to google hkc kids classic that this is just a made up team from some off brand clothing company
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it might not be anything in asia its very common to have crests and logos that simulate popular brands or teams but are not official at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure it is a piece of donated clothing to the refugees im pretty sure that ubeernuts and umoonpenny are on the right track with h kids classic edit sorry ukryonik i missed your post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks similar to the real madrid crest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,depends on the context if its a national flag there are a couple middle american flags with the same colors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the overlapping letters in the center are h k c and the three words seem to be the same in both the orbit and the scroll underneath kids classic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,such a heartbreaking picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats the context of the picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahh thank you here is much clearer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nice job at this point i think its just the brand of the clothing as most suggested
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought that as well but rm logo has a blue stripe on white background one on the picture is a white stripe on blue background
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they should be moroccan or pakistani migrants at the idomeni camp at the border between greece and macedonia apparently the father cries because only syrian afghan and iraqi refugees were allowed to cross the border maybe a football team from one of those countries
whatisthisthing,not_removed,see three lines above
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it says h kids classic on the top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here is a slightly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,me too maybe some lesser known club
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a manual rail switch heres a very similar one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that has got to be the most indifferently hung drop ceiling ive ever seen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it ill mark it as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,indifferent is being very very polite
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would assume that this is because of a glass tax or window tax at some point in the buildings history buildings would be taxed per window and in a effort to lower their taxes building owners would often brick up windows httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwindowtax
whatisthisthing,not_removed,another reason might be due to having the chimney stack behind the faux windows seen on the picture they keep the frame and stonework the same so it remains symmetric and doesnt ruin the exterior or look odd seen this some times when ive surveyed buildings
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting idea about window tax these buildings are located in lviv ukraine and were built when this part of ukraine was under the austrian empire i havent heard of such a tax imposed under austria but will try to look into it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive also seen windows boarded during a bathroom addition or remodel no one wants a giant window in the middle of their shower
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the fact that its the same windows on each floor makes me think its for some mechanical purpose maybe thats where they did a retrofit and added a vertical shaft for plumbing wiring elevator stairwell heating system etc it might also have something to do with an enclosed stairwell for improved fire safety codes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpimgurcomappczj there are examples of it all over the city judging by the paint jobs they were boarded up a long time ago and likely not by the residents for in that case im sure each boarded up window would look maybe it happened in the when this city came under the soviet union and when many of the flats in the city were partitioned into two or more flats or the buildings could have been built like that from the start instead of leaving too much empty space on the facades they made fake windows to decorate the facades in areas where inside it made no sense to have a window
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also where the saying daylight robbery originated from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe the building is a facade for some infrastructure like a subway ventilation system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they were built that way a big part of that style of architecture is the rhythm of the elevation this means that often a store or chimney is in a location where the elevation requires a window in such cases they used a stone blank instead of a window it seems odd to modern sensibilities driven by function rather than form but many architectural styles placed a greater emphasis on creating a strong image to the world than we do now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i often wonder why people dont reinstate the windows i see bricked up windows a lot in my city
whatisthisthing,not_removed,window tax isnt always the case its one of the most incorrectly sighted reasons for windows looking like this where i live in london while there was indeed a window tax at one point many buildings feature facades like this simply because breaking up the exterior of what would otherwise be a flat wall is more visually appealing than not doing so in many most cases there was never a window nor the intention of one being placed there its important to remember that the window tax existed long ago before income tax was a thing many of the buildings you see like this today were actually built after wwii meaning they came long after the window tax ceased to exist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its kind of a myth that window tax lead to these windows it was mostly just for making the building look more aesthetic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fun story when i was younger we lived in an old colonial style house in new england the builder was concerned that a similar tax would be introduced here in the us as a work around all the windows in the house were actually built like doors floor to ceiling and opened completely even had door knobs the upstairs had very few windows not accompanied by a balcony it was kind of neat but a pain in the ass to seal and keep warm in the winter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive also seen this done in older buildings that have been renovated to cover up elevator shaft ways cheaper to just block up the window than redo the whole facade
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think this was because of window tax you hear people say that a lot but i think most of the time its to keep the building looking aesthetically pleasing they usually call them false or blind windows afaik im sure someone that knows more will chime in edit i thought i heard about this on qi and it turns out i did cant find a clip of the episode but theres a transcript on page about it the panel are shown a picture of a house with some bricked up windows down the middle and are asked why they are bricked up the answer is that it is to make the house look more symmetrical not all houses with bricked up windows did it to avoid window tax although some did it looks like this is probably the case in the first picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it definitely used to be a thing at least here in the finland i used to live in a very old wooden house and it had some extra windows painted on the walls for this exact reason
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what im thinking the building was re partitioned to make more flats or rooms and that window had to go and they did the same on every floor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,either due to window tax or because it prevented changing of the interior certainly wasnt built like that in that picture you can clearly see how windows would work well there why not go into one of the buildings and see what is behind one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly just cost but after living without windows there for years theres a good chance that rooms have been rearranged or remodeled around the lack of the window imagine theres a kitchen with cabinets mounted where the window once was or a bookshelf likely the people in the spaces now never knew a window there so they dont really miss it it looks silly from outside but probably looks right from inside so why deal with the cost of opening it back up i would want to personally i dont like the look from outside and id rather have light and air but that assumes that whatevers been done inside hasnt made it impossible or cost prohibitive to do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be a case of building permits i have relatives in a similar historical building and theyre not allowed to reinstate the windows because theyre not allowed to modify a historical building no thats not a joke
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in many cases once the window is bricked in the living space takes over the area there may be a bathroom or kitchen with cupboards against that wall or possibly even a room demising wall where the window once was
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its one of the most incorrectly sighted reasons coincidentally sighted is the most incorrectly used word for cited sorry couldnt resist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is fun
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah yes thank you i googled blind windows and found this quite informative article about them httpwwwsashrepairscoukinfoblindwindowshtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i imagine theres also an element of history too those windows were closed up years ago some people want to preserve the historic changes to the building
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats just nuts they should be allowed to bring the building closer to its original state
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hahaha thats some fine pedantry there friendo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes well try telling the government p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm yes shallow and pedantic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what else are you looking for it was the registered trademark of the parent company of bonanza and ponderosa steak houses and referred to their salad bar or buffet it would appear this refers to bonanza specifically given the fact that pretty much no one else would ever call something the freshtastiks food bar given the trademark one assumes this was just a pin worn by bonanza employees
whatisthisthing,not_removed,information on this little lapel pin would be appreciated the closes info i could come up with was that bonanza steak house called their salad bar freshtastiks a japan firm made a mothers day cup with freshtastiks on it i could not find a picture of this pin on line it has a registered trademark symbol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wanted to make sure it was from bonanza could not find images on line solved

whatisthisthing,not_removed,so it is not a nest but it is the result of a wasp is there a reason they put a lot of them on only one specific tree in an area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not a nest per se but gall wasps lay eggs under the bark of the twigbranch it is suspected that the larvae release a hormone that encourages rapid growth in the plant essentially a tumor that feeds and protects that larvae while it develops as for why this particular tree has so many galls it could be that the tree itself is under some sort of stress leaving it more susceptible to the wasp or it could be that this the only tree in the immediate area of the species that this particular wasp is attracted to

whatisthisthing,not_removed,has holes on all sides except the back flat wooden back no mounting devices i added some velcro so i could put it on my wall the holes are about inches in diameter the inside area is about inches deep looks like you could possibly throw balls into it or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youd have to remove it to be sure but it looks like a small machine screw panhead id guess national fine thread maybe a but again youd have to remove the one you still have and take it to a fastenerhardware store for the screw and nut that said most of those places wont sell just one screwnut theyd want you to buy a whole box which would cost way more than a clicker counter which you can find for less than
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinda looks like a pop rivet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some style of httpsunrisefastenernetcasenuthtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,on the other side of the clicker theres a screw that goes through the whole thing and threads into the centre of that nut so i dont think its a pop rivet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the two pieces together are called the real trick is finding the exact right size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aka sex bolts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,plug in transformer likely for an alarm system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a power supply for something you shouldnt unplug probably your alarm although possibly something else like a sump overflow alarm or maybe furnace controls follow the cable to find out what
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a carbon monoxide detector that looks vaguely similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the size and darkening around the middle mean that it has a hertz transformer in it and has gotten warm over time its not dangerous thats normal for plastic of that era it probably contains brominated fire retardant i would unplug it and see what the label says many wall warts like this were custom made and have the name of the manufacturer who made the product it powered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can be anything really backup battery transmitter scam anything really the fact its secured in can mean its important it can also be a sham item trying to be important if you have anything in your house like an alarm or detector this is likely powering it could also be a co detector but i personally havent seen ones quite like that still wouldnt unplug it unless i was sure really i havent seen this specific model so i cant say probably powering something else important in the house or is a detector of sorts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an ac transformer takes wall voltage and turns it to most commonly seen powering alarm systems and doorbells yours looks like one wire is disconnected so whatever it is supposed to power is probably not working
whatisthisthing,not_removed,quite possibly a wificell signal booster
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have something exactly like this from what i understand it emits a high frequency or something to keep bugs out of the house something like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it can also be a power saving device or power factor correction device both of which are shams for home use and do not work they are scams the bug thing also comes in various scams not all actual emit anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id imagine somewhere nearby there lives a guy who just likes to paint rocks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first impression is something masonic particularly the smaller one on the left it seems to resemble the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiunicursalhexagram however in my opinion its most likely someones personal representation of it the two studied together with their differences leads me to surmise its some kind of art possibly with some occult undertones id be interested in more information if you can provide any
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i found these two rocks yesterday on the side of a rural backroad near where i live the interesting part is that about years ago i found more rocks with the same symbol on them particularly the left one ive wondered what they meant for years and now that i found more im really curious any ideas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks to me like op likes to paint rocks and post them on forums as found objects
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they were found almost miles away from where we found the original ones now that i think about it i think ive seen a sign post near this area with similar symbols on it ive never stopped to get a close look at it ill go down there and see if i can find it and take a picture the old ones were also quite a bit smaller than these two and were probably impossible to notice unless you were on foot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is nothing recognizably masonic about them source am a mason
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you still have the rocks you found years ago im leaning towards this being the work of a local artist or something like that whereabouts do you live
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id definitely be interested in that sign the unfortunate thing with symbols is that just like art and alphabets their meanings can be highly personal the two youve shown are highly reminiscent of various practices and arts but without knowing their creator are an interesting mystery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,which is why it was a first impression friend
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i lost the old rocks i was only years old at the time so i didnt think to take pictures of them it could be an artist but the old ones were very crudely drawn compared to the ones i found yesterday an artist would take more time to make them more elaborate i am aware of a schizophrenic man that sometimes wanders near my area perhaps he made them edit i live in the pnw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah sounds like an art to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think this is just kind of a piece of random decor spirals are one of humans oldest motifs so it makes sense that you have probably come across a similar symbol in a game or something somewhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it seems to just be a spiral form little sculpture but its in the same rough shape as the guthixian god symbol from runescape if thats what youre thinking of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just looks like a spiral form of fire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a treble clef sort of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reminds me of some of the vampire clan symbols from legacy of kain soul reaver
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if youre talking gaming all i can think is the wow or the httpretroshowcasegrimagesbootscreensdreamcastbootgif
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats undoubtably what the physical piece is and it definantly makes sense as you said that such an old human art tradition would be carried into games of fantasy i just cant remember what
whatisthisthing,not_removed,up voted for the runescape reference
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seconding the recurring symbol its bugging me that it resembles something else but the logo comes to mind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cork is an expansion gap filler it takes up space around the edge where the wood would normally swell and retract and as its flexible and can expand and contract with the harder wood allows for the movement
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe it allows expansion of all that wood on the stage floor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,expansion strips cork expansion flooring gap insert strips
whatisthisthing,not_removed,background i was in an auditorium today when i noticed there was a or so strip of cork between the outer edge and stage what is the purpose of the cork strip it doesnt seem to be a filler since it is a consistent strip around the entire edge im guessing something for vibration or acousticbut would like to know the actual reason edit this is a lecture hall stage not a performance stage back wall has scrolling chalkboards
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ideas come two my mind either a way to account for expanding of the floor or to stop creaking less likely a tangible safeguard maybe you would feel the edge while dancing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i imagine it allows you to hang a skirt around the stage or a banner or something similar you would put tacs into the cork and let the rest hang over the edge like a dust ruffle on a bed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think so the stage is not very deep like a performance stage this is more of an instructional auditorium if i rotated the camera up you would see three banks of vertically scrolling chalk boards edit you can actually see how deep the stage is the black line in the top right of the picture is the back wall
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a good one but why would it also be at the stairs

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have pet rats they poop dry little pellets just like this but bigger trust what everyone is telling you these are absolutely mouse poop you thinking they cant get in means unfortunately nothing i also work on cabinets for a living theres a lot more space in there than you realize especially by the dishwasher youve got mice and where theres poop theres pee they leave little streaks of pee that dry quickly that you wouldnt notice if you havent been washing the flatware right before using it youve likely been putting mouse pee in your mouth via the flatware mice can carry one of the strains of giardia that humans can contract not to mention hantaviris call an exterminator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,congratulations you have mice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i keep finding these little brown poop like things in my cutlery drawer as far as i can tell they dont smell but occasionally one or two will ooze out liquid the way the drawer is situated i dont think its a mouse or rodent the drawer is at waist level and adjacent to a dishwasher on one side and nothing on the other theres no evidence inside the drawer space that the counter top is falling apart or anything it is also only in this one specific drawer edit seems like the general consensus is mouse poops and im inclined to agree i just wanted a second opinion on the matter its a shame too because i have a cat so it means shes not earning her keep
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mouse poop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,time to get some glue traps youve got mice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we just had to deal with this exact situation the other day it drove me insane yall got mice ok first check your other drawers for poops as well chances are theyre eating crumbs and scraps they might even have made a little nest somewhere we found they had turned shredded swiffer pads into a love nest under the floorboards under the sink everything that has poop on it will need to be removed and washed but dont put them back store them somewhere where the mice cant get to them trust me the mice will be back and they will make a mess everytime the next thing youll want to check for is if theres any way that they can get from drawer to drawer we had a small gap between each drawer at the very top so we had to install planks of wood to block them off in case this kind of thing ever happened again mice suck because they poop on everything and make everything unsanitary youll want to set up several traps with peanut butter inhuman or otherwise trust me these mice have to go asap or your life will be miserable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,plug any openings around plumbing with steel wool heck any openings you see period
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you got mice son if you can find out where theyre coming in stuff it with steel wool and seal it up with expanding foam mice cant chew through steel wool remember that they can squeeze through a gap only inch wide for now i would wash your cutlery well and store it in a plastic bin with a lid rodent feces can transmit a few lovely illnesses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,go to home depot and buy sticky traps they should have them there put them under your kitchen sink cabinet and elsewhere they can fit clean your silverware you can become very sick from the mouse turds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im going to veer from the crowd and say it could potentially be roach poop according to the link pic from cornell mouse poop looks more pointed on the ends the poop i see in the pic looks rounded like the roach poop either way time for some pest control
whatisthisthing,not_removed,burn the kitchen down your infested
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep its been an ongoing thing for years here theyll always manage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont forget good ole salmonella
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for mentioning the health risks i feel like this should be higher up and i sincerely hope that op sees this i come into contact with mouse pooppee semiregularly used book store and its a serious concern we turn away anything that comes in with mouse leavings even if its just one box out of two dozen even if all of the boxes are full of highvalue things we could make tons of money on if it comes in together it gets sent away together its not worth risking giardia or hantavirus op you need to get an exterminator in there and wash anything that could have come into contact with mice you dont want to get sick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a mouse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the mouse is probably coming in from below or beside where the pipeshoses run to your dishwasher then crawling across to the drawer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mice are amazing acrobats and tricky little fuckers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look for greasy oily or dirty spots around where you see the most poops set up traps in front of those places
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an adult mouse can fit through a hole the size of a pencilmaybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im going to go with roach poop roaches of the huge variety we often call them waterbugs here in tx but they do leave little brown turds just like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no they cant they can only fit if their skull can get through its way bigger than a pencil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not understanding the downvotes here httppestkillorginsectroachespoop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a plastic bag tie thats reusable you know like the type of bag at a markets produce section
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from excessive research occasionally watching day time tv the experts on the auction programmes some times hint that chinese antiques are currently at a premium as various chinese parties are trying to buy back their antiques from foreign lands perhaps this is destined to go back to china and obviously has a greater provenance than the sellers knew
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sothebys also got a similar items valuation wrong but not as drastically
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from the mark huddleston senior specialist said we are delighted with the houserecord sale of the chinese wucai vase this vase was consigned via a chinese client initial research when cataloguing had pointed to a number of historic precedents sold in the tens and hundreds of thousands we examined the decoration to the collar and felt that it lacked sophistication of these early pieces whilst we dealt with a number of condition enquiries before the sale little could have prepared us for the result bidding began at £ and with a handful of telephone bidders plus the usual hundreds online predicting the final price became impossible the most gratifying aspect is that a number of bidders were actually in the saleroom and had viewed it in person one bidder even flew in from japan and has a number of these in his collection tldr they had researched the price but thought this particular vase lacked sophistication a chinese client thought otherwise
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what auction house was this i use the saleroom too actually having an auctiom on it on saturday hope any of my items go for that haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,says its still live the plot thickens
whatisthisthing,not_removed,many of the points made here are correct chinese collectors are indeed intent to buy back pieces of their history and are more likely to trust foreign auction houses especially if something about the provenance is known or can be proven i think its important to note that the seal is pseudojiajing that is pretending to be from the ming dynasty it is likely from a much later period and could even be republicanera im constantly amazed at what chinese collectors are willing to pay many really do have an excess of money its not a totally new story in the a chinese collector traded his estate in northwest beijing for two porcelain teacups it was a famous enough trade to make it the talk of peking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this just makes me wonder how rich you need to be to spend over £ on an old pot that sort of cash would completely change my life but instead its been spent on a bit of ceramic that will probably just get looked at occasionally or just stored away somewhere and not even appreciated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a typo the top right corner says
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting that on the page linked below it no longer shows the price you go to the auctioneers page and it has a carousel item with a missing image stating a chinese vase went for £ but clicking takes you to a missing page curious whats up with that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if video games and movies have taught me anything the symbology on the side is a map to an ancient sunken treasure or lost city the price was driven up by the good guys trying to identify the bad guys during the auction odds are high that the item will be stolen by the good guys prior to the delivery of the item to the bad guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i might have this wrong but ive heard that these extremely high bids can sometimes be money laundering
whatisthisthing,not_removed,makes me think of the six napoleons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the most recognized auctionhouse in denmark recently sold a chinese vase for mio danish kroner the new generation of chinese are rich af and are buying back their heritage not an answer just a related fact
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or seems like a few things wrong with this auction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,saw a documentary claiming most chinese antiques were fake and as a result many chinese buyers dont trust their purchases unless they come from the west maybe this has something to do with it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i went to an asian auction to bid on some japanese woodblock prints there were a couple of chinese robes estimated in the range one went within the estimate the other went for likely a couple of savvy bidders recognized its royal provenance we spoke with an expert from antiques roadshow who used to work for the same auction house he didnt think much of the person running that dept i smelled sour grapes but he likely is right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,curious why is a low estimate bad for business dont they get a cut no matter how high it sells
whatisthisthing,not_removed,man that is one ugly vase
whatisthisthing,not_removed,money laundering a chinese client selling an item to anonymous buyer for a super inflated price that chinese seller just made a ton of legal money from an unknown source might have even been himself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i read about this somewhere and i thought it was on reddit so i was expecting someone to have said this already many chinese antiques are being bought to be brought back to china yes often their auction prices are quite inflated because antiques like this are used as business gifts or bribes and the more expensive the item the better the gift if the item was purchased at auction then the high price paid is publicly known and makes the gift better i dont know where i got that from or how true it is as i couldnt come up with anything when i googled so i may be completely wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not necessarily in this case but sometimes sheer bloodymindedness can play a part i attended an auction at which fairly generic busts of philosophers and composers valued at went for because the two women bidding on them simply hated each other and couldnt bear to let the other win
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im thinking either a typo using the european comma or it could possibly be a httpswwwquoracomhowdoesonelaundermoneyusingartwork shhh op dont draw attention to this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that says it sold for £
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a ming dynasty vase
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everything is worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my thoughts on this are the estimate is per item per pot the description says that this is a lot if items lot as in group of multiple items and the valuation is based on the number of items at that single item valuation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most likely this add to the fact that modern reproductions dominate the domestic chinese market collectors looking for the real thing look to the west as they know a piece brought over years ago that had been appraised by experts are most likely genuine so those who have the money are more likely to be paying through the roof i too have watched too many episodes of antiques roadshow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup this article explains it the economic boom in china from the last decade created a whole class of ultrarich eager for a piece of their own culture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as various chinese parties are trying to buy back their antiques from foreign lands think of it as rebuilding chinese artistic culture for a century their antiques were exported under unfair trade practices enforced at gunpoint under colonialism then in reaction to that maoist communists destroyed many cultural treasures because they were relics of bourgeois exploitation of the noble peasants whatever your opinion of the current generation of chinese billionaires is china has a great history and bringing artifacts back is a good thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wasnt rush hour based on this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved this lead me to what im going to say is the answer its a wucai fish jar from the jaijing era in china essentially is just a very rare and valuable jar from the as you can imagine they dont come up for sale very often so they reach a pretty penny when they do both christies and sotherbys have sold one from close to or just over a million usd now im really curious as to whether or not the the auction house or the seller knew what they had in their possession at the start of the day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have no knowledge or ferraris about these vases but it seems like £ was cheap a decent price as well the sothebys one sold at a higher price £ but had a cracked bottom i think the buyer did a good buy and would not be surprised if it can be resold at around the million mark edit messed with the number and the currencies pondered deleting the post but went with correcting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,isnt it surprising that the auction house wouldnt have known about this other similar jar being sold for so much at sothebys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the auction house will typically err on the side of caution with descriptions ie talk something down as opposed to overselling something if theyre not sure of something if the buyer decides its the real thing then thats their risk and they are not being mislead by the catalogue description this item is whats known as a sleeper an item with a suspected higher value that lacks sufficient provenance auction houses have open viewing before sale so items like these can be inspected up close and potential bidders make their own mind up as to the value with the estimate value is fluid and everything is worth what someone is prepared to pay for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no not just a single client it takes at least two to bid the price up after all looks there there was a handful of wealthy bidders involved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fellows sons they do an insane amount of auctions one most weekdays normally split into categories monday is there general antiques day it can be a great place to pick up a bed frame coffee table lamp etc this lot was more than slightly unusual
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you click the watch button though it shows the list of auctions and that lot is finished now with the correct £ tag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thats it the auction itself is still live hence the live tag but that lot has been sold and closed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it will be appreciated but thats a crazy amount of money i could buy my house times over and have enough to spare to buy a decent car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sometimes purchases like this are just extravagance but there are a couple of other angles that wouldnt occur to most nonrich people one is that its a speculative investment by someone who can afford highriskpotentially superhigh reward investment speculation the other is that as with highend jewelry this is a small item that is easy to transportship across borders without detection and also easy to pass down to heirs without detection by tax authorities jewelry is preferred for this type of surreptitious wealth movement because its smaller and far sturdier and also has breakdown value sellingtransferring precious metal and precious stones separately making identification of their origin nearly impossible but large and fragile art objects are definitely big players in the surreptitious wealth movement world
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i listened to the live feed as it was happening definitely not a typo it started at £ and once it hit £ it raced up via £ increments until £ at that point they started doing £ increments until it reached the selling price of £ there were four people frantically bidding for it two dropped out once it hit £ but the remaining two bid rapidly back and forth until the £ mark
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre getting a little carried away there but you brought up another real possibility of cooperation between multiple bidders to perpetrate a fraud this would be a plausible strategy for insurance fraud by establishing a high value for the small and fragile item via an auction with multiple bidders bidding very high for it then having it stolen broken wouldnt do as it would trigger a detailed expert inspection of the wreckage and making an insurance claim
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like the cut of your jib
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how would the money be laundered back its not the person can sell the vase for what was paid for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,came here to say this yeah ruling out any massive typos or the chance this that is secretly something amazing and one or two collectors realized it while the auction house did not this was probably laundering of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,£ apologies if the apostrophe is confusing i know some european countries use it as a decimal place the figure im referring to is close to million pounds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it means they did not properly identify the item hence they were not able to target their marketing could be if auctioneers got together the right audience then the item could have sold for much more this is how you get some bargains at auctions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because then you get less money
whatisthisthing,not_removed,losing must be a better way of laundering money
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perhaps the same pair of welldressed and bejeweled women i saw in an upper east side manhattan drug store about years ago they were pretty memorable as theyd gotten into a loud verbal altercation which progressed to a physical altercation which only stopped when the police arrived after being summoned by store management which had tried and failed to get the pair to shut up and leave and called off the fight pretty sure they were getting arrested though i wasnt able to stick around for the end of the show the object of the dispute a beanie baby must have been rare even though obviously brand new and still in production since it was for sale in a chain drugstore i doubt the price could have been more than but the legal bills were probably quite a bit higher for both of these nutjobs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting have you heard of such schemes before using an auction house ahouse owned auction house as it were to launder illgotten gains
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a lot can be just one item more than one item in a single lot is usually described as a group if they were meant to to stay together then they are a set
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a double edged sword for ebay sellers though which is a common place wealthy chinese will purchase back these antiques when i sold antiques on the side we dealt in chinese items because the premium can be excellent we bought some tea pots for once that we then sold for not as good as ops example but still a great score the downside is that ebay is the customer is always right so it was a common scam for people in china to purchase items from us receive the item then claim that it was seized by customs not as described arrived damaged etc the burden of proof is absurdly low for ebay buyers so when they filed a claim the money would automatically get pulled out of our account and the effort needed to prove the person was scamming was usually too high to make it worth disputing it was a net gain but you never knew when youd suddenly have a few hundred or thousands of dollars less in your account
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do these artifacts eventually end up in museums or do they go to personal collections
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you know what im really happy china is getting their stuff back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can sell old ivory cuz
whatisthisthing,not_removed,take really good pictures of them several showing every side and angle and then post to raskreddit or rexplainlikeimfive asking where to find a way to get them appraised describe any markings or identifiers im sure someone would be able to point you in the right direction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,always fun when something goes like that my local auction house tiny backwater place had a teapot at estimate and it sold for £ in the end to a phone bidder ive never known them have a single phone bidder in over a year
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i will throw in one more thought here real estate booms in california are being caused by significant numbers of chinese buying milliondollar homes the real estate story appears to be that it is a way for wealthy families to convert cash into assets which are safer to hold on to perhaps this is a similar strategy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your corrections nailed it based on the current shitness of the pound sterling the previous auctions and this one are bang in line with each other
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but only one thought it was worth £
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so true that is one of the great lessons of buying at auction something is only worth what at least two people are willing to pay for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i stidied horology at bcu school of jewellery so was there pretty often
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that must have been intense to watch very cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and the bottom says
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the buyer doesnt need to sell the vase the vase has nothing to do with the real transaction which is making a payment to the buyer for something else think cocaine nuclear weapons components etc in money that can be depositedinvested into the legitimate financial system because it will check out as having been obtained from an auction of an antique art object
whatisthisthing,not_removed,guy has two vases one worth and other one that is stolen is worth he gives the stolen vase to buyer who then pays for the vase now seller has with receipt showing it was honestly earned buyer has the stolen vase or some other illegal stuff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think more likely than not its money laundering but with this type of object sometimes an auction house has had experts try and fail to firmly authenticate the item as a genuine x and therefore wont describe it as a genuine x or appear to imply that they believe it to be a genuine x by listing it with an estimated sale price that couldnt possibly be justified unless it was a genuine x along come at least two very sophisticated bidders usually with intermediaries acting on behalf the anonymous bidders who examine the object directly and determine that they are confident enough that its a genuine x to bid on it as if it definitely is the important distinction here is that the auction house would be committing business suicide if it saidwrotedid anything that could reasonably be construed as trying to lead a bidder into believing its a genuine x if its later confirmed not to be or very unlikely to be the auction house is screwed taking a huge hit reputationally andor in legal bills andor in refunding the purchase price to the winning bidder without getting a dime of it back from the seller on the other hand a bidder and intermediary agent are free to take a huge risk or in rare cases may have some expert knowledge that allows them to really confirm its a genuine x and will allow them to confirm that to an insurer subsequent buyer etc there is zero incentive for such bidders or intermediaries to share their special knowledge with the auction house or to share with anyone how they arrived at the decision that it made sense to bid so high for the item also there are some dumb rich people in the world with flaky egos who can just get it into their heads that they want to have a plausibly genuine x to show off to their dumb rich friendsclients with a claim that its definitely a genuine x a million bucks may be pocket change to them but the auction record helps prop up their story about having a genuine x
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or maybe wealthy chinese people have a bunch of minions looking for this kind of objects hoping to do a score on an undervalued items
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not your fault the pic from the auction site has it written two different ways
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well the traditional methods involve establishing a business and treating the money as income then paying tax on it which after setup payoffs etc is going to cost you about as well set up crappy restaurant subsidize initial receipts but not too much that you accidentally look like an anomalously successful business get restaurant to breakeven asap gradually increase sales on a slow linear climb until its making the maximum that a restaurant can credibly make pay tax on everything thatll soak some amount of cash per year but has to stay open constantly once you saturate more than or of them you might want to look into opening a sham advertising agency that handles all the ads does sales to the restaurants the restaurants overpay for products each restaurant gets a writeoff and the ad agency makes money the restaurant ads sales co can be a tiny single office in the best tax jurisdiction in the region with very few real employees an auction would be a comparable way to do it on a onceortwice basis and only requires two colluding buyers to move the price up to the right level
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pablo escobar used to lose of his money every year to bugs mold rats and water damage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not really dirty money is worth a lot less because its uses are very limited when someone accepts dirty money through some illegal transacation theyve already calculated in the discounted value
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a beanie baby thats hilarious
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i linked to three articles about it each word is a link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it actually used to be a fairly common practise in mmos with auction houses gold buyer puts up a relatively worthless item for a massively inflated buyout price seller purchases it for the requisite amount no idea if its still done presumably was useful for the same reasons of obfuscation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,private collections but of the art in western museums was donated by private donors and most of the rest was purchased with money from similar donors but that is to be expected after maoism the cultural revolution was super extreme communism people in many villages were forbidden to even own cooking utensils being encouraged to eat every meal in communal cafeterias generosity isnt a big principle when you dont technically own anything the current generation of rich people generally started with a parent or grandparent who was a government official who was able to accumulate resources and influence in other words corruption but maybe this fascination with antiques is a sign of a larger pattern of rebuilding the ancient culture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rantiques rwhatsthisworth too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i love when stuff like that happens to tiny backwater auction houses those outfits save so much junk from landfills that will eventually become rare antiques and theyre not making a whole lot of money doing it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the cool thing about these runaway auctions is that they mean that there were actually two buyers willing to pay in that range
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a breakable ceramic jar isnt quite as safe an investment as land
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks only thing is that i did not see when the sothebys auction was and realistically the prices should really be converted to yuan cny at the time of purchase since buyers willing to shell out this much for this item are likely chinese
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yea but at least a few others thought it was figures you know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,two people do an illegal goods deal the seller goes out and buys a small priced antique art work and puts it in auction the illegal buyer then goes to auction and bids thhe work up to the agreed apon price of the legal goods usually with plant from the seller being another bidder to bid against the buyer to drive it up now the buyer has transferred his money to the seller and the seller gets his money in a way that on the surface looks like a legal transaction and the buyer does not have to explain what they spent money on and the seller has a legitimate purchase to deposit the money and does not have to hide it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so sort of like the old scalper trick theyre not selling the ticket theyre selling a sock that happens to have a ticket inside it which is free
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh really i can only see it written once at the bottom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in an eyerolling sort of way the store manager and police officers were not amused
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry thought that was a single hyper link to a wiki on money laundering thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope but having hundreds of thousands of dollars in a small enough space to fit in a suitcase means that if you think that things are going down in your home country you can take it with you on the way out i understand this is the appeal of diamonds as currency too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,top right corner sold £ finally figured out the £ thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whoops i see it now the £ must be a mistake i imagine the person tried to type £ as £ wouldnt fit in that banner but my guess is letter characters arent read by that database table so it dropped the k and left it at £
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it stick to a magnet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like its made of lead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you measure and get the density
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there a hole in the middle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,huh well now theres something you dont see every day where was this and when was it still warm or hot when it hit im wondering if this isnt some debris from a satellite or something given how charred it looks and the downward direction in which it looks to have impacted that windshield there were reports of something streaking across the western us skies a few days ago that looked like a meteor breaking up but you never know at any rate wow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn is your neighbor ok
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like an explosively launched piece of lead is the metal soft the scalloped pattern around the edge is quite interesting it might possibly have spalled off a larger sheet that got struck i would normally say maybe some sort of ordinance but on the july it might just be someone screwing about edit you might want to ask what the cowlitz public shooting range was doing that night
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the edges make it look like a metal slug from a punch the carbon is probably from a cnc plasma punch machine maybe fell of a scrap metal truck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok so maybe im a total idiot feel free to use those exact words if anyone can disprove this theory but i have to imagine this came from an airplane weather balloon possibly fell off a bridge or overpass where a and b are invalid because the angle of entry would have missed the dash board and c and d are consistent with the damage to both dash and windshield a semi would have to kick up that piece of debris about off the ground either at an incredible distance or at an extreme angle to account for such a nearvertical drop onto ops car no
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it a lead weight for balancing large tires
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from the amount of damage i would have to say this did not come from the road the high angle of impact and the energy behind this tells me this thing had some serious altitude it is either from space or an airplane or was launched very high up feet in the air by an explosion of some kind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,likely a mangled piston from a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the dent in it reveals what really does look like lead i have no explanation for the scorching but a lead block about that size reminds me of those lead weights they at least used to put in little foil baggies to weigh down balloons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ford freeze plug patch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i might be close with a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a idler pulley for a serpentine fan belt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what are the dimensions a quarter is about inch that makes the size of the object at about inches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my call is that someone is having fun with a gunpowder cannon does it smell like sulphurgunpowder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,meteor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some seem to conclude it came in almost vertically but couldnt the impact through the window have altered the trajectory from a typical curve to a near vertical
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the cap from a ujoint to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its space debris
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be crustedover with driedburned bearing grease dirt it appears to be a badly mangled ujoint bearing cup from a large truck had it not been lubricated in far too long the grease wouldve driedout the bearings wouldve gotten rather hot from friction and those things can get pretty gougedup thrown if the joint falls apart causing the driveshaft to smash into the pavement undercarriage etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im going with random piece of metal that fell off of a flatbed truck trailer that was likely deposited during loading its probably lead destined for recycling that was launched when another tractor trailer ran it over
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a piston to me were there any broken down cars in the immediate vicinity
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unfortunately its at my neighbors office at the moment she said shell bring it by on monday and i can test it then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why were you downvoted it does look like its made of lead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like youre right any guesses as to what it might be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill try to borrow it tomorrow and check the densitymagnetism
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no hole its completely solid all the way through
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it might be a satellite too this happened on the evening of july along at castle rock between seattle and portland
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmmmm i would think that something from a satellite would burn or melt into a spherical or teardrop shape rather than a disk but i dont really know about these things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,meteorites are often covered with ice by the time they land because the parts that are left after heating in the upper atmosphere then cool down even more in the lower atmosphere when theyre moving slower through denser air i dont know if that would apply to a solid chunk of metal though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if im not mistaken i think i heard on the news that the object seen on the west coast of the us was a piece of a chinese rocket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes the whole family is fine if it had hit a foot further back though it would have gone though the front seats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking the marks on the side look like a torch cut like its a circular piece cut out of a larger sheet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are these trajectories accounting for the fact that the vehicle itself was probably travelling at least if not near mph
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fellow total idiot here i like your thought process upvoted with significantly less force
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this sounds interesting could you link to an example of this tha loooks like the one op posted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i doubt it brake caliper pistons are cupshaped they are a hollow tube with one end blocked off you can even see this in the pic you linked the object in ops pic is solid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a lead block that size probably weighs close to lbs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its only about the size of a quarter though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,update it is definitely not magnetic pretty sure its made of lead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks lead to me too not buying that its from outer space probably flung by a semi logic says it would be roundish if it tumbled through the atmosphere burning lead would melt on the way down from the heavens ripley signing off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not sure any measurements my grandpa has a lead chunk that looks similar but im not sure what it is ill ask him
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to test for lead pick it up if you think wow thats heavy its lead also try to scratch it with your finger i deal with a lot of lead that is possibly an alloy and still soft lead but i guarantee by sight it is not lead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,spacecraft engineer here earthorbiting spacecraft are designed to burn up on reentry as completely as possible and typically scheduled to reenter over water orbital decay is a well understood phenomenon so this usually goes to plan few materials can survive reentry one being tungsten which isnt really used in spacecraft except occasionally as ballast tungsten is extremely heavy so youd notice how uncannily heavy it is such a chunk of metal would never have come from a spacecraft this of course is according to the practices of usaeujapan who knows what kind of crazy shit china puts into orbit these days
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe a piece of some sort of homebrew firework
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would xpost this to a physics or astronomy sub and see what they make of it id be curious on the physics of such an object doing that damage with that apparent trajectory on a highway i could see a heavy piece of road debris penetrating the windshield but then the dashboard and at that angle its interesting thats for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look at the pic with the quarter it looks like it was hollow before getting ground down and mangled by traffic and whatever else horrible fate befell it before coming to rest on ops friends dash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might want to look at the pictures again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the way its chipped in the fourth photo doesnt look like lead ive never seen lead break like that also the hole in the windshield plus the dent in the dash looks like a nearly vertical trajectory although thats hard to say without knowing the cars speed my biggest fear is that it could be radioactive if it came from a satellite they dont use many dense materials in spacecraft but radioactive isotopes in power supplies are one exception the chances are low but not zero that it came from a secret military satellite from any nation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think it could have had that trajectory if it was flung by a semi imagine the angle that object must have had to create that dent in the dashboard and that hole in the windshield it would have been coming nearly straight down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its about inches in diameter and of an inch thick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont the gashes on it kind of help prove it is lead i mean i think you would need a pretty soft metal for gashes and scratches to happen like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay it weighs grams and has a volume of about cubic cm which gives it a density of lead is just over so i think we have a winner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could also be tungsten carbide although the cut sides do have the dull appearance of lead i suggest wc as it is heavier than lead and often used to balance hightech stuff helicopter blades for instance use diameter rods of wc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it were tungsten it would be either unchanged or shattered not all chewed up like ops if it is lead like others are saying i doubt that it would be from a satellite
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fun fact about the etymology of tungsten it is scandinavian and means heavy stone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,homebrew firework jesus that sounds dangerous i hope this isnt common
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thats a good point its possible i guess tbh what i find strangest about the whole thing is the angle it came in at and the velocity to punch clean through the windscreen and smash the dash like that it must have been travelling damn fast as someone else said i think space junk is a legitimate possibility here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep missed the picture with the quarter that is a little small for a idler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,still a little too small
whatisthisthing,not_removed,having copped a piece of scrap metal through my windscreen from a truck waaaaay ahead of me i can attest to the fact that yes it could see the thing bounced off the road from where it fell off the loaded truck and it had an almost identical destructive result with the only thing being i saw it coming in the nanosecond before it hit its metal its off a truck for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some more science to it since were pretty sure its lead which is one of the heaviest materials on the planet a cubic inch of lead weighs just under ounces this is probably closer to cubic inches which makes it weigh over a pound well be conservative and say its a pound a pound of lead flung at a windshield at mph will certainly punch a giant hole in it and crunch the dash foam
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah tungsten carbide doesnt get gashes carved into by anything else it would be unchanged or completely shattered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe not a satellite but what about an airplane
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its common enough but no more dangerous than all those fireworks they made illegal because of how dangerous they are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reekris get the wata
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you didnt blow shit up as a child
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very good possibility
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could have had a lot of spin and when it impacted the windshield it turned down into the dash i think were all a bit relieved that it didnt wind up like the brick woman
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wasnt talking about the velocity i was talking about the angle of entry obviously its plenty heavy and fast enough to do the damage we observed but how would a part falling off a truck or being flung under the wheel of a truck enter from such an angle it looks like it would have been moving straight down onto the car and the slight discrepancy along that vector could be accounted for by the cars forward motion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its totally possible and im no expert but why would they use a material good only for weight on something that flies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yea so again nothing aerospace related would have such a chunk of metal that seems to just be a weight anything that needs to fly like a spacecraft of aircraft is always pressed for mass commercial airliners are designed to just barely fly with their own weight and their payload passengers with a small factor of safety a puck of lead should never be included in an aircraft design it doesnt serve any purpose also this still doesnt account for the scorching reentry makes sense but something dropped from an aircraft wouldnt experience any significant aerodynamic heating
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is how id envision it the lead chunk is flung up in a high arc by a semi tire catching it on the road using the same premise as a baseballsoftball pitching machine it hits the window while on the descending end of the arc impact with the safety glass window puts the brakes on things enough to simultaneously deflect the trajectory as well as slow the velocity then gravity plus the remaining deflected velocity takes over to dent the dash some distance behind the entry hole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it almost looks like a set of tetris blocks maybe its a sprite sheet for a game you downloaded
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a texture map of some sort do you have any tetris like games on your computer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a tetris ripoff asset collection
whatisthisthing,not_removed,metadata says apple and display device profile so something to do with display calibration do you have a macbook
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but why would a game host its textures on imgur
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just did show in enclosing folder and sure enough its a sprite sheet for a game why didnt i do that sooner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i do what i dont get is why the name would be the website address it was hosted at
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ds with a dolphin is probably dolphin safe as in dolphinsafe tuna httpsenwikipediaorgwikidolphinsafelabel all though i cant find that exact logo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the ears look like shrek ears and there is a dolphin in the s dolphin shrek
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like this group put on shrek the musical in httpnustudenttheatreorgwikiindexphptitlethedolphinshow maybe a blanket from the production
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow yeah that looks to be it thats impressive howd you find it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it looked like shrek ears and there was clearly a dolphin a google search for dolphin shrek returned a possible hit near the bottom of the page which led to a lucky google image result on dolphin show shrek with the main logo then some other google fu to find the link above and confirm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks man really appreciate it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ingredients iron powder water activated carbon cellulose salt and catalyst needs no refrigeration start to react once tear out the out bag and expose the pouch to air reach maximum temperature c in minutes and provides up to or hours warmth httpsenwikipediaorgwikihandwarmer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this was given to me by my mum said a friend from work gifted it to her i know its a disposable heatpack but id like to know how it works and what the instructions say i think it lasts hours from the front of the packet but thats as far as i understand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chemical heatpacks typically use a supersaturateddiluted chemical like httpsenwikipediaorgwikisodiumacetatewhich when activated turn into a waxy crystalized solid creating heatthe wiki article i linked explains the process
whatisthisthing,not_removed,activated charcoalcarbon take one out of the plastic packaging exposing it to air massageshake the heat pack to warm it up keep in a pocket to increase warth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the reusable heat packs use sodium acetate and dont work nearly as well as the onetime use ones this looks like the onetime use type
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this just happened to be asked yesterday
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sewer line vent pipes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where is this located is there a high water table here septic systems
whatisthisthing,not_removed,vents youll find them near parks which have been built over land fills
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perfect solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but they dont smell bad
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is south is detroit not a high water table nor do we have septic systems
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gas lines also have vents
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its from the desktop a dust filter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep i have identical ones all over my nicer computer cases
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my son and friends had a lan party and were hauling around computers could be a dust filter from a desktop case im just trying to figure out if it belongs to my truck or not thx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes something like image on the page
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the httpwwwvenganzaorg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is the flying spaghetti monster a symbol of atheism it critiques the idea of god by saying existing depictions are as arbitrary as a flying spaghetti monster believers are called pastafarians i have been touched by his noodly appendage

whatisthisthing,not_removed,he boiled for your sins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ramen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this probably isnt from star trek discovery with being the reg for the enterprise and discoverys being if ncc numbers are chronological were still a bit out from that plus despite it looking funky and discovery being a visual reboot i think this is still way too funky and way too far from canada to be part of that shoot my money is on something from seth macfarlanes new scifi tv show its called orville so ill bet anyone fake internet points that theres an o behind the strap making the reg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a spaceship prop but its actually for a new seth macfarlane scifi dramedy series orville like mr dac said
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its probably a prop for the new star trek series
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where was this taken the new star trek series is filming in canada i believe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a piece of a ship to me the uss millennium was a daedalusclass federation starship in starfleet service in the late century the ship went missing and was presumed destroyed edit i think the is the convention used for shuttles so maybe its a shuttle from the milennium
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a star trek nacelle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a shuttle from star trek
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like top of a windmill one of the new big ones they are putting them up all over the us
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like the thing you take the rides in like the virtual spaceship things we rode these when i went to beach while i was a kid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a space ship
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks exactly like something out of mass effect could be a prop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where did you spot it and which way was it headed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a similar construction to one of those plastic show planes you get at airshows are there any conventions around you soon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the coupe wnavigation package
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is the decenium eagle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here i was ready to say for sure its a wind turbine nacelle despite never seeing one that looks like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a windmill turbine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im pretty sure this is kinda like a spaceship ride for kids i remember going inside of one of these as a kid at a mall in dallasfort worth i dont have time to find a link but if someone can use the google skills to check for me that would be great
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe set for a movie project who knows who cares
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bill lawrence scrubs cougar town just filming a pilot that was space travel based could be related to that as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah the ship has a star trek feel but i dont think its star trek
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its gotta be one of those crowd funded indie trek moviesseries theres at least one happening now and there have been lots in the past i mainly say this because as a huge star trek fan that ship design is wack so its gotta be amateur
whatisthisthing,not_removed,excellent analysis i agree it doesnt look trek to me looks more like a parody using a similar font and vessel numbering to give a sense of familiarity to a nontrek show
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe its from the federations future i honestly hope not though time travel is kind of overplayed in trek lately at least in my opinion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but mcfarlane was born in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from the set years in the future the show follows the adventures of the orville a notsotopoftheline exploratory ship in earths interstellar fleet facing cosmic challenges from without and within this motley crew of space explorers will boldly go where no comedic drama has gone before similar to the original star wars trilogy orville will rely on models for much of its spacecraft rather than cgi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,source
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im holding out for a sequel to galaxy quest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this guy right here as soon as i saw the vc i knew it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i suspect promotional material rather than a set or prop i think they would be more secretive with a set
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im frequently in an area with tons of studio trucks moving tons of props around i have never seen anything uncovered definitely not something as large and as identifiable as this id say the trucking company really screwed the pooch on this one if it really is from the new series
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wonder if they are carting it around to outdoor locations
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes makes me happy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no for all sorts of reasons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its filming in toronto but there is building going on in montreal as well i was going to ask if this was spotted between the two id bet not star trek then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i love you edit wait theres nothing about a us millennium on memory alpha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats exactly what came to mind the numbers even have that sort of trek style to them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks very trek but i dont know that registry number weird something vc vc could indicate vulcan theres just nothing out there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thats what i was thinking too i wouldnt be surprised to see this in the new series somebody out there will be pretty excited to see this picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fyi it looks as though you failed to reply to someones comment as youd intended and instead posted a toplevel comment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,didnt know bill was working on a space series i was thinking just the other day how good a space themed comedy would do on tv right now and bill lawrence no less
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i worked on the lot theyre shooting on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably a painted green screen for the whoosh whoosh space ship pewpewpew scenes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess is one of those immersion rides
whatisthisthing,not_removed,keep holding never give up never surrender
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the v is actually an n nc was the federation of planets call prefix for numbering ships but yeah the numbering and lettering gives it away as from star trek
whatisthisthing,not_removed,finally figured out your comma situation you did a right before it so it became an exponent now i have to put my math degree to the test to figure out what e is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,name just one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just found it on some site oh httpstexpandedwikiacomwikidaedalusclass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikidaedalus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you know i think i heard something about vulcan federation ships on the new series
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does the show look any good
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ala alalalalalala
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ncc actually or nx very rarely anything else agree the lettering screams star trek but that ship definitely does not look federation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is definitely a v not an n even with the strap zooming in it is clearly a v the line is at an angle not vertical it would be a very weird font if that was a n
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that strap was kind of close so i wasnt positive but you are probably right definitely star trek though really beautiful too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,iirc ncc stood for naval construction contract and was the contract number
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought so too at first but im pretty sure its actually a w
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we have lots of reasons our reasons are the best reason really they are awesome great reasons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,moving to another studio
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah ok thats not canon the millennium was from trekmania a fan fiction site
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought about that but im not totally sure because the last leg of the n would be at a pretty weird angle for the normal trek font at least from what i see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thats not an n the line is way to angled for it to be an n
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not op but ive done location and postproduction audio for film what you see during shooting vs what happens in post can be two very different things things can go swimmingly on set good acting nice script all crew on their a game and get edited to shit that said i hope its good i could use some fresh scifi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you tell me about trying hard though canyou
whatisthisthing,not_removed,best second audio track ever
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i was thinking it definitely looks trek but not like anything thats actually been featured before and that font is extremely reminiscent of the iconic star trek font however didnt they print the ships identification on the disk section usually all the images of the enterprise i can find just have the saucer marked with the identifier i would put my bet on it being a prop or setpiece for a movie or tv show and lean towards something star treky scifi at the least
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im betting theres another piece perhaps some sort of saucer section
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe its the new nsx
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well maybe it looks pretty new so im guessing its either for one of the new movies or maybe someones working on a new series one can only hope
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like the standard ship design minus the disk and nacelles i would imagine those were removed and shipped separately
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a warp nacelle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the saucer she has separated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and the new series takes place before tos so it wouldnt be that design at all could be a fan made thing though cool whatever it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nx are experimental ncc are starships owned and operated by starfleet those are the two most common prefixes theres also ngv that are timeships there are more prefixes used throughout the series but theyre never consistent or common
whatisthisthing,not_removed,guessing its just a small part where set designers have decided people will have to interact and the rest of the bits and bobs will be composited in post if you think about it like that does it seem more federationy to you im a big fan of trek but im guessing you outrank me in knowledge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be just a piece of a prop put the saucer on top and its suddenly extremely federation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,absolutely a v
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to me it really looked like an imitation star trek with the color scheme etc like a galaxy quest prop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,top men came up with our best reasons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm you may be right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the registry number can appear in a few different locations the saucer being one of them this looks like a shuttlecraft however window in the front door in the back and a registry on the side would be typical in that case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats likely not a star ship but probably rather a type of shuttle the back panel soars to be able to come down to make a gangplank although the round top is towing me off shuttle insignias are commonly found in the side of the vessel id say the starfleet emblem is missing for plausible deniability
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this looks like the engineering section the top of it is the top of the neck for the saucer the weird front shoeprint looking thing might be the navigational deflector
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i bet its from the new show
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bah even casual star trek fans know its ncc im not a nerd
whatisthisthing,not_removed,star trek discovery new series supposed to premier sometime later this year​
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this shows a complete misunderstanding of federation starship design
whatisthisthing,not_removed,great movie
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shuttlecraft never even crossed my mind good call someone else suggested the v is vulcan which i could maybe see if this is for the new series set before tng i would think a federation ship would look less advanced than the ships from tng but a quick google for vulcan ships i could maybe swing that way definitely doesnt look like what comes up for vulcan shuttle but i dont remember seeing a lot of vulcan spaceships in tng and im pretty unfamiliar with the other series
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id say its definitely a shuttle youd expect there to be windows if it were a starship wouldnt you and what point would there be in creating a model so big you had to separate it to transport it on two different flatbeds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking this was a shuttle craft too because of the back door good call
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres he possibility that there are pieces of the ship missing as well it could have been taken apart for easier shipping
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a runabout
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you would think they would cover it for transport
whatisthisthing,not_removed,judging by the size and location of the registry number and what is obviously a door it is a shuttle pretty close to its on screen size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the hinged doorramp probably has something to do with people thinking that you dont see vertical hangers all that often
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seriously i dont get it either a saucer could clearly be attached on the top and if you look at the lower back end where the securing straps are you can see an indentation for where the nacelle struts would attach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not saying its to scale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everyone says that i found it kinda meh but lets pretend this is a vulcan shuttle would it not use vulcan writing or would that just be illogical
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its possible in enterprise they were all rounder and had the ring and by tos they had shifted to the more federation box style so someone could throw in a design between the two and get something like this or someone followed that train of thought and designed a prop for a completely different series
whatisthisthing,not_removed,vulcan is a member of the ufp vulcans serve on starfleet vessels although there are often ships with predominantly vulcan crews
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it was a shuttle craft because it fit on the back of a tractor trailer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possible id thought that at first too but then i thought if this was just a piece of a spaceship to be assembled elsewhere where are the connection pieces the top which id think would be the connecting port for the saucer if it were that kind of ship shouldnt be finished if its a prop the fact that its all smooth like this points to this being a finished prop not a piece of one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i found it kinda meh oh is that what were gonna do today were gonna fight
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what about the spinny craft that future spock flew was that a vulcan craft or sf vessel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its being used for shots of scale models coming and going that may be all they need other than wanting to pack it with an absurd amount of explosives i dont have another reason coming to mind to build a non shuttle to that scale its also possible the rest is just on another truck that wasnt noticed or otherwise delayed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im sorry i liked the cast and at least i still respect you as a person i just didnt love it but bey id never object to watching it again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was that in one of the new movies i guess a private ship
whatisthisthing,not_removed,substitute and with a and b abba abab baba the second one looks like a mirror image but its not the same in reverse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its to make you think there is a hair on your screen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres one like this on youtube except with a spider
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it some kind of alternate houston rockets logo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can half answer this the manufacturer mass produce those hats blank tourist locations will then have them logod for their specific attraction source i saw those stickers on those hat all through out revelstoke resort and the their town a couple of days ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the hat itself is from a company that makes blank hats the logo is custom placed and has something to do with your friends past probably that relates the two maybe a team they played on together
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the r in the riaa logo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe rebels or resistance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jbl audio pretty big name in subwoofers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you live in bc or were you just visiting if you live there hello from a fellow canadian
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jbl audio the jbl logo is not round does not contain an r is not red on black
whatisthisthing,not_removed,snapback is the style
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes but apart from that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is the logo on the hat red it looks white to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,⌐■■ ••⌐■■ ಠಠ mother of mercy you are right it looked so red at work today
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it does have a pink tint to it could be the lighting edit you know looking at the front seam i can make out what could be a red stain there in the black that logo could very well have started off white then had something spill on it is the dress gold and white or is it black and blue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was probably the muddy lightning combined with the fact that i use flux which tints the screen more yellowish as it gets later
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can sort of see a pink tint to it i thought we were about to embark on another the dress issue and lets be honest no one wants that 😏
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is what it is egg sushi called tamago nigiri
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tamago is made from beaten egg with the addition of mirin a japanese sweet wine soy sauce sugar and dashi stock a combination of dried kelp water and bonito flakes its cooked as a folded omelet and served cold or room temperature
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tamago is basically a sweetened omelette
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved op hope you enjoyed the tamago its one of my favorites
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes tamago is one of my favorites
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you describe it a bit is it solid heavy hard what does it look like when its not backlit more pix if possible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,warm it up my guess is a large glob of pitch used to play with them as a kid im from the oregon coast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so heres a development my sister in law who found it dropped it and it bounced may just be a torn up bouncy ball any ideas with that other than bouncy ball
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like its an
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a golf ball core
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i pulled one of these up while salmon fishing in ak once iirc the captain said it was an egg of some kind but i dont remember what kindi cant find an example edit if it cant be penetrated by a hook its not what im thinking of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it hollow i found one of these in the willamette river recently and it felt like a red bumpy lacquered egg with nothing inside my best guess is that they are oak galls which are basically protective nurseries for insects mostly wasps i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be a baseball or golf ball core
whatisthisthing,not_removed,amber you say httpsenwikipediaorgwikiamber
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably agatecarnelianchalcedony try rwhatsthisrock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive never been to the oregon coast and ive never seen ambergris whale poop but is there any chance that is what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably not ambergris
whatisthisthing,not_removed,great find i hope it turns out to be good for you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,petrified bollock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it hollow i found one of these in the willamette river recently and it felt like a red bumpy lacquered egg my best guess is that they are oak galls which are basically protective nurseries for insects mostly wasps i think

whatisthisthing,not_removed,ambergris is hard and resinous like amber but it isnt amber colored its gray or black hence the name ambergris gray amber also not poop its an internal secretion that yes may be pooped or vomited out but its not poop or vomit in the sense that it started out as food
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my understanding is that ambergris is vomit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an honest question met with a flurry of downvotes hooray reddit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awww i got excited
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it pick up after the first few episodes i made it halfway into the second episode before i lost interest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive never seen it myself but according to this wikipedia article its usually pooped and only vomited when its too big to poop but the article also says scientists theorize so i dont know what is rightwrong httpsenwikipediaorgwikiambergris
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an honest question that should be answered by googling rather than asking it here the number of people who answer witts with very little knowledge about their answer astounds me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought so once she starts losing impulse control and figuring out how to kill people without getting caught it got pretty hilarious the season leaves you with a big cliff hanger as well i could be biased tho ive always liked both of the main actors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well my source is an encyclopedia brown book i read years ago someone found some ambergris and because its used in perfume and is valuable the bully tried to steal it encyclopedia brown saved the day by being a big ol nerd who knows everything and in the process explained that ambergris is whale vomit game set match wheres your fancy wikipedia now id like to see you big word your way out of this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dang you might have me hard to beat encyclopedia brown i wonder what the hardy boys have to say on the subject
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the case of smelly nellie i remember reading it too more like years ago for me

whatisthisthing,not_removed,after searching for pdf editor for google drive i got on httpwwwmakeuseofcomtageasilycollaborategoogledriveonlineannotation it looks like the second result kami is what is on the screen solved

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its likely tourist art looks a little like an eastern orthodox icon someone may be able to identify the figure is it made of pewter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tourist art makes sense i think its pewter thanks for your reply
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its probably tourist art pewter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,find out what the man with the golden gun made his gun with and youve solved the riddle

whatisthisthing,not_removed,from urasmis in rvexillology note that the stripes are also used above the entrance doors and on the calendar in the middle using that i found noch jahr wahnsinn another year of madness i think it was a collection of plays exploring madness but i am unsure give em a call and report back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a theater and other images online show that they display a wide variety of flags i assume that the flag and the horns is part of the play being run at the time it looks sort of like the which may be the setting for the play edit based on the higher resolution image from your other post it looks like the flags are simply resembling the yellow and black caution tape i cant find any other meaning behind that particular pattern and color scheme

whatisthisthing,not_removed,try scratching with a steel nail if it doesnt scratch probably quartz if it does scratch try putting vinegar on the powder if it fizzes then its calcite if no fizz see if you can scratch it with a fingernail if so its likely gypsum or halite rock salt halite tastes like salt gypsum doesnt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pink himalayan salt rock i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rwhatsthisrock might have an answer for you

whatisthisthing,not_removed,you are watching edit though im not sure id agree with strange b movie its just from the with jane fonda that would be like you saying you watched a strange bmovie with charlize theron or scarjo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so weird i was just thinking about this movie a few minutes ago god its boring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,one of my favs d
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol barbarella strange b movie thats pretty funny
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an a list actor does not an a list movie make the production values were so absurdly low even for the late sixties
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that did just age me years mentally and i wasnt even alive when it came out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mark it solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,except it had quite a big budget for the time it was just a box office failure what makes a bmovie is low budget and unknown actorsactresses jane fonda was a sex symbol of the time this was no different than the version of aeon flux with charlize theron
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same i think its the fact that i just realized that there are young people now who cant identify jane fonda
whatisthisthing,not_removed,faye dunaway was better looking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure i agree with you but i could totally understand the preference
whatisthisthing,not_removed,finally figured it out its a httpoldcarandtruckpicturescomhenryj it was built in the early by a company called httpsenwikipediaorgwikikaiserfrazer it is definitely a httpsenwikipediaorgwikihenryj and my guess is that it is some shade of green but i could be wrong hope that helps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might have more luck posting to a car specific sub maybe try rclassiccars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your grandparents are so damn cute i love old pics of loving couples they have so much more love and charme than todays pics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,colorizebot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its bothering me that i cant figure it out are you sure its a car it looks like they might be looking a little bit down towards the camera and i found a lot more trucks with square speedometers then cars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is exactly it great detective skills i was thinking it could be either green or blue but now that i know the what the car is a can research common colours
whatisthisthing,not_removed,man how the hell did you identify a year old car made by a defunct company just from the door trim and a bad view of part of the interior im astonished
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ooh well done
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks ill give that a try
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this would make a lot of sense because my grandfather always had a love of chevy trucks and chevy truck however i tried googling chevy truck interiors from to and didnt see any pictures with square speedometers i did notice that the chevy truck had the same looking shifter another note is the rear passenger window i dont believe that trucks that old came in a extended cab so i am inclined to guess it is a car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it very well could be a truck what yeartype of truck were you googling that resulted with square speedometers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think it is a belair i just google searched belair interiors from and none have a square like speedometer if you can provide a link to a photo that does then i would be grateful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks it took me a while haha if i were you id search the car in different colors and apply a sepia filter to try to get a close match good luck my guess is that it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,about minutes if clever google searches haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks it wasnt easy to find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i will try that the green colour looks like a good candidate i am colorizing the photo as a christmas gift for my grandma so when i finish im going to post it on reddit ill see if i can cross post it or tag you in a comment someplace so you can see it when im done
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i spent hours google searchingyou need an award for best googler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id be very interested in what sort of searches you did to get to the end result
whatisthisthing,not_removed,remind me month
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would be awesome good luck colorizing ive tried my hand at it and its pretty tough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the googlefu is strong with this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im usually shit at google but i know cars pretty well so i kinda knew what to look for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay so i started with insert car brand here interior i tried a few of them like chevy ford packard buick mercedes and so on no real luck then i tried the same for no luck then i tried a few specific years and included a few searches with square speedometer guess what no luck i found a few similar but no dice throughout my searches though i had come to the conclusion that it was definitely a model car so then i searched best selling cars of and came across a few brands i had either forgotten about or had never heard of after a bunch of searches i managed to come across a small web page detailing a couple old restored henry js from and and there it was total time spent was about minutes but it felt like an eternity
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am well impressed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,spooky but this was just answered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a sticky pad you can put your phone on and it doesnt slide around what does it feel like edit or as usoliddoctor said to mount a gps to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had one of these in a used car i used to have stuck pretty good so i never tried to remove it i believe it is used to mount a gps or some device to your dashboard httpswwwaliexpresscompopularadhesivemountingdischtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a mount for gps models that do not suction cup to your windshield
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the base to a mount of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the one i had in my car was shiny and smooth either its made to stick a suction cup to it or some bracketharness fits around it and grabs it somehow it drove me nuts when the sunlight would reflect off it just right so putting some black rubbery tape on it wouldnt be a bad idea because i think theyre near impossible to remove without leaving a mark
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats exactly what it is heres a picture i took off mine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well dang thats almost certainly it thank you though i must admit i was expecting something a little more exciting like the onboard radar emitter or something p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,then yeah its most likely to mount a gps too try httpwwwmountguyscomremovingcaradhesivedashmount
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i love that stuff unfortunately i already sold the car but thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just now realized youre not opwhoops
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol all good but thats a good idea for op if he wants to remove it cheers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look like crackpipes to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look like pipes to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are pipes used to smoke crystal meth referred to colloquially as bells
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the ends look like plastic if so they wouldnt be pipes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its either a crack pipe or for blowing bubbles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be fogged glass although the edges of what would be the bowl do look rather warped almost like melted plastic plus what would be the stem looks like its pretty dirty on the inside could just be a factor of the black backdrop on clear glass making me think something was smoked out of there at one point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are plastic also the size of a pinky finger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe for blowing crack bubbles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it could be lots of things with the image quality hopefully op will tell us what material it is also if it has been smoked from there would probably be a smell to it the mouthpieces if they are pipes look too complex for a pipe seems like there are springs in there but a thrown together pipe could be made form something like that i suppose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,part of a hearing aid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what im thinking too something someone just threw together real quick thatd explain the poor choice of material and the strange ends it looks to me like when you pull the ends downwards compressing the spring it stops the airflow op not mentioning the smell could be attributed to not knowing the smell of weed or whatever someone could have smoked from these and thinking it was unimportant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no smell weed or anything else but they are kind of burnt and yes that is a spring also the pot part can be detached from the shaft
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats the bowl made of edit sorry just saw your other comment plastic gotcha im like sure these are makeshift pipes proooobably not weed because stoners arent this desperate for a pipe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is something to do with the nfl maybe a very old pinring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks slightly similar to postcivil war button edit do you have a photo of the back is it made by scovill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks similar to the nfl logo but i dont think thats it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unfortunately the back piece is missing its just open on the back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the button uthetwolabyrinths posted is insignia of the adjutant general corps the original photo is definitely not the same the ag corps insignia hasnt changed it doesnt look like any military insignia that im aware of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well it has the exact same shape im still sticking with something very old of nfl good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah i see i would imagine its something similar although i couldnt find anything which exactly matched from a cursory look through pictures of old brass buttons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,white truffle chinese ones are much less pungent and tasty then european ones what does the inside look like maybe a female one read httpwwwchinesetrufflecomchinesetrufflehtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was there no labelsign
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like aka sweet taro
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be celeriac does it smell vaguely like celery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hm possibly seems a bit too large its about the size of two fists here it is from the inside httpmimgurcomzrsvdlg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there was indeed httpimgurcomtfindvz
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know i meant expensive for a root
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely something related but its in a separate section next to the satoimo its wrapped individually whereas the satoimo are in a bag like regular potatoes possibly a different part of the root
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not celeriac no slightly nutty taste
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope thats not a truffle looks more like some sort of rootturnip like thing not a clue what though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that makes life much easier yatsugashira やつがしら 八つ頭
whatisthisthing,not_removed,humm yucca root is very tarolike but they are usually long and narrow edit could it be jerusalem artichoke or sunchoke
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah great thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely not a sunchoke sunchokes look more like ginger root and are relatively smooth compared to the fibrous skin of the thing in the photo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rwhatsthisbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its cool i found out through a quick google search
whatisthisthing,not_removed,holds a water bottle

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre called quickdraws but that is definitely not one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be a for jewelry making
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres is another slot on the back of it about twice as wide as these two but the same width any chance anyone knows why
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,holy cow i think that may be it thank you im going to leave this open for a little while longer just in case but come morning im prepared to say this is solved if no one else has an idea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,confirming its for opening jumper rings i bought a few of them for making chainmail

whatisthisthing,not_removed,intake for pipe organ maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a closed hole from what used to be a wood burning furnace exhaust probably removed in a remodel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe those are lights but i cant find a link to anything similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting it was a pretty old building makes sense
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct its a vent these appear from time to time here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,likely solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ithink its just a posh drinking cup flask ive seen people with similar drinking water at their desks and the like

whatisthisthing,not_removed,pneumatic tube canister
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a tea tumbler but ive never seen one with the infuser in the middle it seems that would be terribly inconvenient to fillempty can you show us an angle where we can see whats inside behind that rubber coating
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rwhatsthisrock is a better fit for your question
whatisthisthing,not_removed,turns out its a generation quartz the green layer is a lab grown layer made by heating quartz under high pressure water with chromium causing the crystal structure to reform
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks will crosspost
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it worth anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not worth too much on ebay a sample like mine looks like its going for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be a little diwali lamp it looks like an abstraction of the date fits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no idea but it does look a bit like a sprite for the pokemon rhydon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone pmed you on facebook
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre absolutely correct now that i think of it since i have a few indian facebook friends it did say something about diwali earlier thank you solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think thats it i dont have any unopened pms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah dont know how i did that but i was quite obviously looking at the wrong symbol on your picture that symbol is right where my facebook shows an icon for recent photos that ive taken could it be anything to do with photos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for your help somebody figured out it was a diwali lamp edit a word
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its in estonian it says dead sea water must have been collected on the of may in neat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well surnumere vesi translates to water of the dead sea in estonian so i think it is crystalized salt from the dead sea someone bottled water from the dead sea in and this is whats left try google translate and youll see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it is a sample of from may
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a really cool find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,crystals are from the salt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for your help

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think water naturally did that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a really cool example of natural erosion to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very good closeups could be used to determine whether this was carved with a tool otherwise i would assume it was made by erosion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty cool may want to show it to a rock hound
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good idea ill try to get some better pics tonight and update thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the whole piece is a transformer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the power supply for an electric fence
whatisthisthing,not_removed,older version of this except mains powered powers an electric fence for livestock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely a likely from a sheep or goat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like cattle shin bone they give to dogs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sheep humerus where are you located
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly the leg bone of an extinct bison according to this page
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its hard to tell from the picture but it seems too perfectly symmetrical to be a bone i suspect its a manufactured object that rectangular notch on the left end looks too perfect to be naturally occurringbut i suppose it could have been cut by a butchers saw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the groove at the top that anchors a tendon is larger on the ops bone not likely a cow could be from a sheep of some sort or deer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was the bison an engineer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the los angeles area movie prop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im guessing space telescope lens
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the dried grass clumps i scrape off from underneath my lawnmower
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like dried up cow shit lmao

whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikikief
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as sarcastic as this soundsyeah it kinda does look like a lot of cow poop ive seen laying around farms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why the dowvotes i agree this looks more like kief than hash kief is made from the trimming and residue hash is more refined solids and oils
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep i think its a kiefhash mix
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no joke here some people smoke horse poop because of the supposed flash afterwards
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if there are buttons on the other side i would guess its the remote control for a toy robot dog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would guess some sort of dog training shock collar system that would be the receiver
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not a sex toy at least not the part that touches your genitals too many cracks and holes thatd collect fluids and be hard to clean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bark control for a dog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agree the vague bone shape suggests dog toy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,again edit

whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is with this thing they are spamming the place lately with it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,screwdriver holder im assuming there are two holes in the end of the metal part to screw it to a wall then the screwdrivers sit vertically in the black squares like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly part of a knife sharpening knife holder i have a set of steak knives that come in a case with individual slots each of which has a little sharpener built in mine is a large flat box but the action part might well look something like this or possibly this is to guide the knives in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,towel holder or broomstickdepending on how long the rack it is on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats it looks almost exactly like the one in your picture it was likely mounted on the wall at some point but the previous tenants may have knocked it off and it was never reinstalled thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,towel holder is possible for small hand towels in the kitchen no use unless its mounted on a wall though i dont see how it could be a broomstick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a variety of hamburger bean often found tangled up in seaweed on the shore see here httpwayneswordpalomaredumucunahtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a kukui nutcandlenut
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be a buckeye seed used as an amulet to ward off bad luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought was raccoon before i came in and saw your comment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its about feet high we have cats but this almost looks like a raccoon paw to me plus i have no idea why our cats would jump up there or why they would be dirty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like someone with a dirty hand wiped looking at the length and placement of each streak id suggest it was likely the persons right hand with palm towards wall and that this persons elbow and shoulder were lower than their hand when this mark was made was someone slipping or tripping in this area recently or perhaps sitting where they might have put an arm against the wall to get up or down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,saw comment still think racoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,guitar truss rods they run along the neck for adjustment when climate affects the wood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that was fast care to explain i know extremely little about guitars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well a guitars fretboard needs to have a very slight bow to allow the strings to vibrate freely when a fretmetal bar is pressed too big of a bow and the string height or action increases and the guitar is both out of pitch and hard to play too flat of a surface and the string will buzz against the subsequent fret the truss rod can pull the neck backwards and more flat or when loosened allow the string tension to cause the appropriate relief
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that makes sense thanks a bunch would this be something someone may have interest in because i have no use for them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any local luthier or guitar repair shop would use them they are about give or take
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they have a resemblance to some old hat stands but i cant find any matches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those look like upside down mic stands too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is a clearer picture possible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a crack pipe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,crack pipe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah pretty much used for drugs best just to throw away dont try to handle it much if its really small like the size of a cigarette and closed on one end with a bit of spongefoam in the end than yeah its a cheap way to hold drugs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,morbidly obese pedobear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwttcpartscom looks like this logo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no it doesnt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its an outlet its for home automation using what ulinotype said somewhere there is a device with corresponding dials on it a lot of people with disabilities use them or just people who want to automate their appliances so they can be controlled from a central location often with adapted controls like voice pedal remote activation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is an remote controllable outlet the letter dial sets the house code and the numbered dial sets the unit number a remote plugged in somewhere else in the house with a matching code will turn the top outlet on and off the bottom outlet is always on wireless control is possible with a third device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks thats exactly what i was looking for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,isnt wireless it injects pulses into the power line in the ac zero crossing period ac has zero crossings per second giving a bit per second communication channel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you have a paddle switch somewhere in the house then you can pry the front cover off set the dials the same as the receptacle and control the top outlet or at least you could in the old days nowadays theres so many switchmode power supplies polluting the powerlines in peoples houses that type controls are almost useless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah tell op that udonniewa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess is dancing looks to me like gene kelly or maybe fred astaire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was a squirrel now it is a mummified smoked squirrel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the pins are unit crests nbsp nbsp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the stand forth is the infantry regiment unit crest they all appear to be army crests though edit found one very similar to the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks pretty much like a run of the mill httpswwwgooglecomsearchqgartersnaketbmisch however i dont think they are native to pakistan so it would be an invasive species
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup its a garter snake lived in new england my whole life theyre native here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im guessing you dont have a picture of the headstamps size of a coke can is probably a shell one of the most used sizes so one of i dont know enough about it to say which one though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you take more pictures than that one all identifying info is included in the headstamps on the bottom of ammunition with size of a coke can i suppose you ment the diameter which is roughly that puts it in the range of a six pounder with a diameter based on on the image alone it looks alot like a french but that would make it more the size of the thin and tall coke cans rather than the normal ones edit a vickerscrayford shell is also a close visual match there is one pictured
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for scale it looks like it is sitting in floor tiles i dont know anything about artillery ammo but figured id throw that out there for those that do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should have looked underneath where the primer is located thats where the caliber is engraved most of the time also the small caliber and the absence of a fuse or a place to screw a fuse on it on top of the projectile that was common on artillery shells could indicate that its an used for direct fire antitank or antiaircraft for example more than for bombing but given the details thats an assumption i make
whatisthisthing,not_removed,likely not enough information from just this one photo to identify definitively no headstamp photos etc if you called the cops dont ever expect to see it again even if it was harmless ie practice or blank
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pics of bottom and measurements required to id for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try this over in rguns lots of knowledgeable folk on ordinance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was the person who owned it a reasonably sane and intelligent person it was probably a practice or blank round
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seriouslymom its not just gunna go off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah the fact that the projectile is completely slick could indicate its a dummy projectile non explosive used for ballistic trainingor an armor piercing one but the shell itself is pretty darn explosive if it hasnt been neutralized even if its a practice round
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey did you get the money i sent you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,use the digital readout
whatisthisthing,not_removed,post the make and model of the oven
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it is in an apartment building you could ask a neighbor they might have the same model or be a model
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have seen some models where the knobs pop out if you push them in the markings may be hidden that way long shot i know for the top burners if they are not marked it shouldnt be too hard to figure out which spot is low and which is max high from there you just might have to use a sharpie or nail polish to mark little dots for the oven if there really is nothing and the digital display is not help get an oven thermometer and you will have to do some experimenting and marking to get common temperatures if all else fails might have to pull the unit out to find the manufacturers plate if the sharpiepolish idea doesnt appeal you should be able to order parts to replace the knobs or face plates good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just a clock and alarm also the hobs have no marking either have been thus far just putting my hand on to work out which is warming up p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i was after i dont have a clue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oven thermometer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,open the oven door there should be an id plate there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fantastic thanks d can get some information on it now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all tchotchkes are technically real
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not ancient if thats what you are asking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most likely cast resin and made in china
whatisthisthing,not_removed,appears to be a rendering of anubis in basalt heres another that is very close except for the ankh probably not an antique
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree looks like a souvenir do you know what white basalt is never heard of that before and couldnt find any info online basalt is generally darkblack this looks totally different from any basalt ive seen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely not an antique
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup and with how much this looks like resin im guessing that one is just resin too cheap export junk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,totis viribus means with all ones might google translate can be hit and miss it seems to be common on brigadeunitdivision crests
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that beehive makes me wonder if it has something to do with utah
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would have guessed dui for an engineer unit but it doesnt look familiar this guy is selling one that looks like someone got drunk and tried to plate it by hand with their eyes closed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved i crossposted to rnew zealand and it is an epsom girls school badge not sure why we have it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you will not rely on google translate in future
whatisthisthing,not_removed,knowing this and looking at it i assume its a miners badge where from idk httpwwwebaycoukbhpminersbadges
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dui haha pretty accurate description of the trademe one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be with the pick and shovel symbol probably from new zealand where my family is from dont think we have any miners in the family though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not sure about what the beehive stands for but its most likely from new zealand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpeombyueduindexphpbeehivesymbol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a very large egg timer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,context where is this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe to measure wind force
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a long shot but we have a gauge that looks quite similar to this one near our water tanks the gauge gives us an estimate on how much water is left ie ½ ¼ without having to climb up the damn thing to get a look inside id imagine farmers with underground fuel storage would have something similar as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a tidal gauge haha thanks for the help guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha no
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its in central australia i think near a river but not a flood indicator its a bet im in with heaps of people we didnt get much just the picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it measures up to with points in between how would that be made into wind force its really confusing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think that is what it is but im not to sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so it is a tidal gauge i have only seen pillar versions any idea how it works
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm a flood indicator was my first guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe it indicates beaufort with danger levels and as extra indicators just guessing beaufort only goes up to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no idea just googled this image and changed the keyword from clock to gauge and it showed this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so was mine but in australia flood indicators are metre tall sticks well stand flat metal pole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is nothing to measure wind on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahh i love learning something new illuminated clockfaced tidal gauge port germein sa httpwwwseasidelightscomauausaportgermeinaspfstatesa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be a gauge for subsurface water level if the ground is saturated flash floods are more likely
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah that what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,central australia is a desert so flooding would be ultra rare
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually flash floods in the stream beds are fairly common in desert areas it doesnt rain often but when it does it may rain hard and the water may run off fast also they often dont build very good bridges in the desert areas and have low water crossings where water may run over the road when it floods there are lots of flash flood deaths in the desert it could be some sort of remote flood gauge to warn you the road is flooded ahead but it would seem that they would label it ive also seen somewhat similar fire danger gauges but it would seem that theyd label that too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rare but
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just learnt something new but no it isnt a flood gauge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok but what makes you sure it isnt a water level gauge we need more information if you know what it is please tell us if not more pictures of it from all sides and the surrounding area may help us figure it out for you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its solved its a tidal gauge i think the photo was in south australia or near a rivercreek
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks very much like a satellite uplink
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he might be a ham radio guy using microwave frequencies they use dishes like that and go mobile to get away from interference or find better signal paths than at home
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what it looks like alright guy got out with a small propellor thing maybe for checking wind speed really curious as to eat he could be doing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,satellite dishes have max safe wind speeds particularly if they are on flimsy vehicle mounts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinda looks a little like a cuff link but thats just a guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all im seeing is a little duck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it looked like a presser foot to an old sewing machine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solder repair plug in an iron bucket long since rusted away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a sewing machine foot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly its so deteriorated that i dont think well be able to figure out what it is thanks for the help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe might be related to httpwwwshopatimagecom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,anything on the back sometimes gift cards will have a number to call to check the balance maybe when you call theyd say the store name
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its so weird seeing someone link to the mall thats right by my house oddly enough though ive never seen that store before
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats gotta be it good job
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure its art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,context
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think that is a mud dauber nest it doesnt look like what i usually see in florida but i found on google soil around you is probably causing the different colors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good for keeping spiders away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mud dauber nest
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mud wasps stay away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you all for your input its right next to where i put my clothes pin you can see the fabric on the right should i more it away so they dont get bothered when i take pins out i really dont wanna get stung its on my back balcony so i go out there multiple times a day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the difference in colour is caused by different moisture contents this looks like a freshly built nest and the daubers cant take all the mud in one go
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do they sting humans
whatisthisthing,not_removed,spider good wasp bad
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they eat cabbage loopers also
whatisthisthing,not_removed,close
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can they yes do they very very rarely and only if you physically assault them they are generally harmless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if annoyed yes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wasp bad dauber good parasitic wasp good tho
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres a difference between wasps and daubers mainly that daubers dont sting but yeah wasps suck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well they look like they sting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chess piece wineperfume bottle stopper whats the bottom like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,candleholder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks a hookah vase you can see more like it httpswwwthehookahcomhookahvases it also explains why it was on a beach im not sure how big it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a decorative collectable bell my grandmother used to collect them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or what it was it seems like this thing lost a big part of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a chalice handle that broke off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this thing is pretty solid nothing is hollow and it was found next to a dead whale on the beach it smells pretty gross and looks as though its been in the ocean for a while the whales guts were exploded it possibly came from inside the whale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a cheap paper weight
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks to be an old candle holder of some sorts i could be wrong though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its this i used to work in a newagey shop and it is a cast plasticresin brahma image probably made in thailand i like the offering theory but cant really speak to whether thats a likely story or not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you appear confident so ill upvote you but dont get comfy ill check back and make sure you earned it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think chess piece too there are different styles made and made of resin and this looks like resin my husband has this really hideous chess set with these enormous pieces in resin of mayans and spanish invaders and this reminds me of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think so there isnt a spot for a candle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not hollow though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think so too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doesnt look like a vase to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it definitely looks like someone left there smoking device at the beach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks more like buddha to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol dont hurtchaself baby
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could have had a top at one point

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not op but it generally means they stopped responding to everyone and nobody has seen them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not really you can accidentally tap it really easily if imessage is already open that would take taps to send any recipients who use an iphone would have gotten an animation of blue sparkles sort of like fireworks the feature is called digital touch read about it here if you just tap once you get the circle and the default color is blue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe it is a locationtree marker for the white pine blister rust program which ran from you can read more about the program here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats not known is whether the hole was punched or caused by a bullet i believe the property was last purchased in three years after the stamped date
whatisthisthing,not_removed,different version of the tag that shows you are right survey marker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,white pine blister rust is why we cant have nice things and by nice things i mean currants
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some sort of ventilation stack for an underground mining operation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,according to a photographer on flickr i have i think managed to find out that this mysterious but impressive piece of machinery sculpture is some kind of water filter made redundant from bootawa dam the water supply dam for the manning valley and great lakesnsw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen one before and i havent been that far up nsw so at least i think we can rule out art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,location latlong or google maps url preferred
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is that near forster
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i vote that you go back there and walk up to it get some close ups trespassing aint nothing but a thang
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my google earth observations installed or later street view time travel there doesnt appear to be a road or trail leading to the item so its not something that needs a lot of access for instance for delivery or removal of material or periodic maintenance no clear signs of recent earth disturbance like for a pipeline or underground building there is a utility easement through the trees heading to the south you can see power lines but it looks like there might be an underground pipeline or cable as well the path through the trees seems to fade out around the area of the object maybe its something like an emergency pressure vent for a gas pipeline however it seems awfully large for such a thing the quarry miles away to the sw looks like a surface quarry no signs of an underground component id expect an underground mine to have a highly visible surface component for entry and exits of trucks workers material etc maybe someones art display or a piece of equipment from someones work but it seems like a very odd place for such a thing no real place to view it and its a bit far from the road i note the grid inside the thing is spaced differently on the left and right sides solar or wind doesnt make sense to me because it doesnt intersect enough sun or wind to be worth that much equipment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if that blue in the device a flame if so it might be methane burnoff from a landfill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,think i remember seeing something similar perhaps one of those things they use to burn dirt from hazardous waste sites
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it inside a fencedin livestock area perhaps it may be a feederwaterer for cattle further google earthing reveals a round pen up behind the driveway behind the house as well as a small barn with what looks to be a small fencedin area immediately adjacent round pens are commonly used in equine activities so perhaps this may be a horse feederwaterer if it is indeed mesh then it wouldnt have to be heavy duty to hold hay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is just a guess as i havent looked at all the google earth views but is there an airport or landing strip for planes nearby it could be a guide light to lead planes to a runway if so or it could signify a private runway for a privately owned plane there are several of those around here but most just have wind socks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could that be some sort of experimental wind turbine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,johnny
whatisthisthing,not_removed,radar tower looks to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a massive sprinkler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would make sense because on the left side you can see that the tubes are hollow so the cover must be some kind of mesh for a filter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres no mining immediately around and its on a private residential property that said an ex miner could well have liked the look of it and stuck it in their paddock for the hell of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah id bet one side is for inflow and other for outflow and the screeningmesh is to keep the critters out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely ive seen ones like this before
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looking at the google maps information posted below there doesnt seem to be anything easily identifiable as the surface operations of a mine there is however a nearby quarry i suppose they could be utilizing the quarry as their surface operations for their subsurface mining operations though nothings readily discernible from the google earth photos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe but it doesnt look like one ive ever seen i dont think its a fresh air intake because theres no fansturbines to suck the air in they could be at the bottom of the shaft i guess and there appears to be a massive bottleneck at the base of it thats gonna restrict airflow and if it were an exhaust shaft it could potentially create backpressure on whatevers forcing the air up the shaft what im used to seeing halfway down the page theres a double fan intake setup it looks like it could be some sort of passive exhaust shaft somebody in the comments suggested a methane vent for landfill i think still it seems an odd spot for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems like he could be right looks to be a passive water intake screen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats it incredible find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,see if you can locate your object on google earth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmmm it appeared there sometime between and there is nothing to suggest there is any kind of underground workings in the area like someone else suggested it could be for burning off methane the screens would prevent the flames from igniting brush but the topography is wrong for a landfill also there would have to be a lot of methane for a burner that size honestly my best guess is the landowner liked the look of it and plonked it down on their property as a sculpture people sometimes do this with mining equipment and such like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes op
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im tempted to send a letter to the owner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to me the blue looks like the sky viewed through a mesh screen on the outside of the cylinders the methane burn off or vent sounds like a good idea but this doesnt look like old landfill terrain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just the sky shot through a grill there was no heat shimmer radiating off the structure so i dont think it was that hot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,too far off the ground for that unless theyre holding giraffes in there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,too low to the ground if you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so far i havent found any kind of radar that has this form nor any kind of sensor for smart farming how big is it i cant really tell if its wide or next thing i thought was it could be a cylindrical but it seems to short to be effective maybe for a floodlight i will update if i find something else
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not the right shape or material for an antenna radar or otherwise i like the vent theory it sorta also looks like an über stylish composter except it doesnt look like it would rotate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and australia is known for its opal mines so it seems pretty likely
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it has dedicated threephase powerlines running to it so i would doubt its there for decoration
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats not how underground ventilation works in an underground vent circuit you need a fresh air intake to ventilate the workings then a return air system to remove the exhaust air fresh air and return air is mostly moved around by large fans you wouldnt get both in the same shaft it just wouldnt work i am thinking of a large mining operation but the principles are the same in smaller excavations is what youd use to get the fresh air in to a new mine that tunnels around wide by high works for shafts too while the mine is still small i guess youd get away with just blasting fresh air in but eventually you need to force the exhaust air out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uwcmbk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wasnt able to judge height without something nearby for scale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its probably about wide
whatisthisthing,not_removed,only one very small town in australia is known for opal mining however australias economy owes a lot to the massive mineral wealth of the countrycontinent including coal gold diamonds iron sand sandstone etc etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i really do no nothing of underground ventilation just figured maybe one side was in other side was out its how my freestanding air conditioner works two pipes intake and exhaust and i was extrapolating incorrectly it seems
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from google earth you can measure the total length as about feet so that gives you an idea of scale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,coober pedy andamooka white cliffs and lightning ridge editkoroit no fightey
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no worries at last i can contribute something to this sub what you were describing might work if there was some kind of ducting inside the shaft i guess but there still doesnt appear to be anything actually moving the air

whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely looks like it was intended to be a waterproof match safe of some sort can you pull the handle out looks like the handle locks the lid in place
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes a waterproof match case looks like this open you should be able to puzzle it out from that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there seems to be something that sounds like small beads inside cant figure out how to get it open any ideas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved yay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it actually unscrews or screws depending on how you look at it the whole outside part of it moves in one direction letting the lid come up off the tube and then slide out of the way the outside can be used to light those strike anywhere matches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,watch this youtube video the small beads sound are matches rattling around inside we used to use these things all the time to keep matches waterproof and you can strike them on the side to light them httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjqwvhzdsdmi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an occupancy sensor with the cover off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like one of im not sure how i feel about all that duct tape lol edit not necessarily this model but this sort of device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is the wire an ethernet cable if so probably wifi access points
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree looks like an occupancy sensor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an ap would not have what looks like an ir lens in the middle the antennas would be embedded in or attached to the pcb itself on the periphery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ethernet cable and its cousins or less cables is often used for building automation and in no way narrow it down towards this being an ap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting what type of function would this device perform
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it depends on what it is if its an occupancy sensor like i suspect again it might be wrong it could be used for a variety of things like raisinglowering the temperature by actuating dampers to the area so that the hvac system is not as taxed or it could have a simpler function that just turns off the lights if theres no one there more advanced sensors can tell how many people in a room those are also useful for hvac
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fascinating thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you are very welcome hopefully someone familiar with this particular device can chime in

whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely this from a carbon ski pole most likely plastic tip with a metal spike ridges hold the basket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved im not home right now but this is almost certainly it my wife just got some old secondhand poles and it likely fell out of them and i didnt notice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its long and made of very thin glass i bought it along with a bunch of scent bottles presumably it is some type of scent bottle however ive never seen anything else like it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,appears to be a perfume bottle dauber
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if the stopper was on the rounded end i would think it was made to fit in a display or rack similar to a wine glass holder asis though it seems like it would fit between your fingers you could holddisplay in one hand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,butt chug bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im doubtful theres a little rim and a cork on the tip of the object that i posted which makes me think that it is a bottle in itself ive never seen a dauber that could also serve as a bottle most though not all are solid and usually they are the same thickness as the bottle that they go to this bottle is ultra thin i doubt a larger bottle could be produced from glass this thin just to give you an idea httpsiimgurcomsfjuclojpg the smaller spiral bottle weighs the bottle in question weighs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well if it wasnt it is now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right these look similar too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have no knowledge in this subject but could it be to make it more mobile instead of having to carry the bottle you can just carry a sample in the applicator

whatisthisthing,not_removed,just looked to see what signed prints usually go for and a lot less than i would have thought is the answer it seems that signed and numbered lithographs average
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is an artist proof look at the ea on the lower left probably more valuable that the other one you have linked still great find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rwhatisthispainting can be helpful with questions like this too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks different than ops though same exact idea different strokes etc ea proof epreuve dartiste
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the info from what i learned these were made prior to that scandal but after some research i learned that the prints might be original whereas the signature is not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks we might sell two of them i want to keep this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if theres no name on it i doubt youll know exactly who made it any number of companies and artisan types made this kinda thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you know of a way to look up how much its worth should i go just based on similar pieces on ebay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to me its a piece to throw out at a flea market im sure it was a couple hundred or more retail its not particularly old so go by similar stained glass surrounded mirrors imo if youre using ebay as a metric filter by sold listings not asking prices
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe this might be a bead breaker for a tire machine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it hollow in one end it looks like it could be an anchor for a large tent or something of the like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for some reason they look like big metal tongs for holding glass or holding steel if you were a blacksmith httpwwwblksmthcomtongarticlehtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that sounds right the slot in the middle goes over the center of the machine to drive the spikeend around the tire to pop the bead over the wheel when mounting or dismounting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rhelpmefind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the core to an air freshener to me does it smell strongly of freshness
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most likely for keeping toothbrushes clean or at least a holder of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i used to have something kind of similarly shaped that when into a drinking water bladder to help dry it out it wasnt as intricate as this one though and was well ventilated at both ends which this isnt but maybe its a step in the right direction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,found a strange silicone thing in a unisex bathroom so i didnt quite feel like putting my nose to close or touching it with my hand interesting theory though it would be a good framework for that sort of gel thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess thats a samsung bluray player i have a samsung and the front corner has a circle like that on the top but the player controls are in it yours may just be a filler plate because theyre reused the case for a different model
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the right answer so quick too thank you its a new model the controls are touch on the front now solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think it is anything more than a fleurdelisesque fineal since it just is labeled patent applied for and has no date it would be very difficult to find the actual patentuse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be a curtain rod finial

whatisthisthing,not_removed,post removed this item was posted multiple times in the last couple of days is the one of the earlier post about the item you can find the others by scrolling down the new section
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that label looks homemade im going to guess its homebrewedfermented alcohol of some kind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,first of all that is one sweet ride and i want it had a buick roadmaster for a while basically same car loved it any residue inside the containerbong i wonder if he was periodically filling container with a fuel treatmentconditioner letting it get sucked into the intake via vacuum port
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a homemade httpoilcatchcancom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it appears to be dryer for the vacuum lines why it would need one is beyond me any water vapor in the vacuum system would eventually find its way into the intake to be turned into vapor and be burned during normal driving
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if not already obvious that is not oemsome sort or homemade trap for moisture or other purpose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a hydrogen generator as seen here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,see i have no idea exactly what was inside the jug i kinda smelled it and dumped it out while taking the pictures but it was a milky white kinda deal more clear than white no real smell and the intake tube wsock filter that ran down inside the jug sat below the liquids level the outlet tube that runs up to the engine does not protrude into the jug past the lid so its not like any kind of fluid was being pumped into the hose going to the engine i even had a local shop look at it and they have no idea what its supposed to do oh and thanks my grandfathers love of buicks led me to seek a roadmaster originally but i ended up getting a fleetwood big loafy grandpa cars are great in general but i really love the run on that style of car bummer they just dont make as many big ass cars like they used to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i think as well i worked with a guy who made one of these and swore it was the future he left his all hooked up as well after finding out it doesnt work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no the wub sticker i should have found a better example but it was cold as hell outside

whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a saudi arabian coin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a retroreflectometer it measures light reflected off road markings i guess to see if they need repainting yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be a profilometer to measure road roughness
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ground penetrating radar maybe to test the substrate of the roadways
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and here i thought i was a genius for thinking we should put reflective paint on the road it already exists and there is a machine that checks it amazing thanks reddit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gpr has to go pretty slow to get decent data my guess is simply getting gps data of the roads to input to a gis system to get decent gps data the collecting unit would have to be either above the vehicle or to the side to avoid interference though it would probably be more accurate to put the unit on top of the car and have a vertical offset maybe they couldnt do that for some reason road roughness is a possibility i could also see collecting data about the curbs but then theyre in the left lane for a while
whatisthisthing,not_removed,man one brain fart and somebodys paycheck is docked
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so its for mapping the lines on the road
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you show us what a modern reflectometer looks like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sounds like scooby saying uh oh reflectometer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep thats what im thinking it is thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is my vote i just saw a demonstration of a device that does this and hooks up to the side of a work truck it was much taller though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i live in michigan explains why ive never seen one the roads where i live are so horrible that we just something was bent in our van i cant remember what it was called something to do with the wheels i dont know vehicles that shouldnt have been caused from hitting something when the only thing weve hit were potholes this van and our last vans struts went out because they are getting so over used
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if that was the case it would be mounted in the wheel path same for a measuring pavement rutting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my dad suspects that it was for mapping underground wires and pipes but i couldnt find anything like it when searching
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are usually trailer mounted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as other people mention above this is for measuring paint reflectivity to see if the lines need repainting the units have a gps but its not really for mapping just for recording roughly where they did the line testing work actual road mapping work is always done by good old fashioned surveying and engineering where they design and keep detailed maps of all the road assets and use optical transits andor survey grade gps to measure everything to centimeter level accuracy im a surveyor and ive done my share of that kind of work which includes surveying before construction for the design work field layout of the design and then post construction asbuilt surveys which often get skipped when the construction goes close enough to design i have also used gpr going slowly but it was actually in shallow water looking for stuff buried in the muddy bottom of a shallow rowing lake an old olympic training basin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i doubt its gps that seems like an inefficient way to map roads especially since most are already mapped if someone needed more details like road width or number of lanes it would be much cheaper and about as accurate to look at google street view and if they needed really high precision data i dont think you could get that from gps alone at the speed of a moving a car surveygrade gps units will take several measurements of a point and average them and sometimes you have to wait a bit to get clear enough satellites signals
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre used to test the reflectivity of the lines they do this yearly to determine how the line material holds up over time in different environments edit i used to drive one of these rigs during summers in college as part of an engineering intern program by my local dot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems to me that its more for measuring the paint reflectivity even during the day maybe theyre using it to figure out what needs to be repainted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they havent made any yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,technically this is a modern one the older ones used to be much bigger httpwwwroadvistacom is one of the companies that makes them edit httpwwwroadvistacomenhanceddataacquisitionlaserluxmobileretroreflectometer is the style of one we used it weighed about lbs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not if you say your ts you savage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so whats it do bounce up and down and keeps record of where there are holes and such
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tie rod
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we also dont put reflective material in the stripe paint to save money when it rains at night the lines just disappear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mentioned gps for road mapping because i worked in local government for a while and it was a project they talked about wanting to do i thought it was silly especially when half the gis people move their collected gps points to match an aerial additionally i know of a couple local govorganizations who like to test their rtk networks by driving around i could see wanting to reach lane edges for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rtk provides pretty decent precision at car speeds the piece on the top looked like a gps unit to me i could see a local gov wanting to map streets themselves
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so many jobs exist that i would never even imagine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not in tulsa they dont
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks extremely dangerous if they are mounted in a normal car like that without any other precautions a pedestrian or cyclist that came too close to that car inadvertently could be seriously hurt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wonder if this is going to become more important now with self driving cars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol thanks man but it was just a joke retro
whatisthisthing,not_removed,profiling has become a crucial practice for transportation departments throughout the world road builders contractors and even us state dots departments of transportation are responsible for gathering statistical information on road surfaces including the longitudinal profile mactrotextures microtextures and roughness to determine coefficients of friction the measuring tasks are especially challenging for most lasers because road surfaces present many dynamicallychanging targets including tarmac concrete yellow striping white striping etc httpwwwacuitylasercomproductscategoryroadprofiling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no maybe a bracket or something i know it had to do with our vehicle not going straight and they asked if we had hit anything and told us something was bent tie rod was broken on the old van tough i do know that i cant remember to be exactly though and my boyfriend who owns the van i dont drive doesnt remember either
whatisthisthing,not_removed,control arm i bent one by hitting a curb maybe a big enough pothole could do similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,additionally i know of a couple local govorganizations who like to test their rtk networks by driving around that is strange to me as a possible serious purpose i can only imagine they could be testing if they can get the rtk differential correction signal from a local transmission basically like testing if they have cell phone coverage here or there unless its a completely casual test just to make sure the gps receiver is working at all by seeing that the pointer moves across the screen and shows them on the map in about the right place otherwise the only truly meaningful test is setting up on a control point and taking an accurate shot i thought it was silly especially when half the gis people move their collected gps points to match an aerial i know its powerfully ironic when they do that to good survey data but in many cases the gps wont be accurate rtk survey grade equipment so the the gis people need to shift the tracks to fit their photos which at least makes it close enough to be a good fit most of the time then we just have to hope their photos are accurately coordinated so they are shifting stuff into the right place to fit survey plans ive seen google earth photos be give or take a few meters for example and my survey stuff which is cm accurate then doesnt look right to a nonsurveyor who doesnt understand which one isnt right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i work in local government we usually map roads by street centerline from aerials or in the case of private roads make an educated guess and just draw in a line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he was a retroreflectometrist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone has to build every part of the world around us
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why did you need a there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes potentially we had flashing lights on our van and a giant board on top that had arrows that directed traffic around since we had to go exactly the speed limit to test properly we got a lot of weird looks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or they could program selfdriving cars to repaint faded road stripes by themselves im not buying a tesla until it knows how to make my coffee and a breakfast burrito on the way to work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol that didnt even click im a bit slow today
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep thats what it is thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the rtk while driving around is to test real world conditions in traffic like if a self driving vehicle were to use rtk as part of navigation my state dot maintains their own rtk correction this is from gis people who dont really know what theyre doing and think the point is wrong by a few meters even when receiving rtk correction and they should be getting cm precision and dont have well aligned base photos city government is fun its not like those points really need to be that precise as long as the city guys dont use the coordinates as truth for marking out utilities
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mentioned it because i worked in local government for a while and it was a project they talked about wanting to do i thought it was silly especially when half the gis people move their collected gps points to match an aerial additionally i know local govorganizations who like to test their rtk networks on roads
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he said see ya latermetrist 🎶🎶
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no he was a driver
whatisthisthing,not_removed,job interviews are wild
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess because thats just how i speak
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you can summon a driverless car youll probably never need to buy one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is my breakfast everyday at mcdonalds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,she wasnt reflective enough for him 🎶🎶
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have any experience measuring the reflectivity of road markers quite a lot actually i have been visually inspecting road markers recreationally since i was i look forward to doing it professionally you know what they say if you do what you love you will never work a day in your life what do you hope to be doing in years well i hope to be working for the dot developing new reflector technology the way i see the world moving towards autonomous cars i believe it is important to not only focus on making road reflectors that are visible to human drivers but also computers so that we can do our part to make the roads as safe as possible what makes you a better candidate then the other applicants many of the other candidates will probably do well in this position it is my belief that many of them plan on using this as a spring board to go into other civil engineering fields i on the other hand hold a deep passion for roadway visibility and plan on using this opportunity to grow with you and create safer roads for the future and who knows maybe one day when you get promoted i will be a suitable candidate for your position haha well we will see about that wow that was quite a ride
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant wait to perform the summoning ritual for my car one day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn that sounds like a good job interview i would hire you on the spot too bad there isnt an open retroreflectometrist spot at the moment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an app on your smartphone you can already summon a car to your door in many places uberlyft it still has a driver but theyre working on fixing that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think i need to level up before i learn that skill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont but why because of car seats or just the whole get kids readyinto the car mess other than maybe strapping car seats in every time who knows its the future wouldnt it be just as good for kids to be able to summon your car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you that makes a lot of sense i had not considered kid stuff maybe one day science will teach kids to need less

whatisthisthing,not_removed,that there is what that is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this would have been my guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not a weaver so i dont know why but from looking around i see them on more modernnewer shuttles apparently theyre covers used in carpet weaving httpwwwhbshuttlecomcarpetjutewoolenloomshuttles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,retaining rod for the bobbin based on the size and construction it was probably used on something large like a rug loom if you were weaving a doublewide rug on a loom so wide rug that would hold enough yarn for a few full passes

whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for the comments my year old daughter found it while we were fencing i wondered about a fake immediately because of something being off about it as a commenter said the back is flat and smooth ive seen local points and this is not like them so if it was authentic it was something unusual mostly i didnt want to disturb the site if it was authentic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this could easily be a legit piece for every one usable head made there were hundredsthousands that were never completed or just plain ugly everybody had to start somewhere this could very well have been made hundreds of years ago by somebodies autistic nephew who doesnt think its very good

whatisthisthing,not_removed,really nice find looks to be in pretty good condition
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they found it in a posthole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,while im not going to comment on the piece itself besides that something looks off about it a person i used to work for buried fake arrowheads in his neighbours garden as a prank a few decades ago so just sayin that its not impossible to be fake
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess is that the skill level of those making stone arrowheads varied greatly i dont think you can make an assertion based on a single sample
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you cant however the notch almost looks like it was made with a machine something looks very off and all too smooth about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep it doesnt look like chert or obsidian appears to be micrite which is much too soft and would never be used by indigenous peoples for tool making
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the arm to a reclining chair of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that piece of metal in the second photo looks like a bastard file that is probably just a slang term does it come out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the metal part moves how like a spring i like the reclining chair arm idea the ratchet points by the metal would work as stops as the back raises up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking part of a from the first pic but the holes wouldnt leave much working area on the edge what are the teeth and metal piece used for that you see cut into the center in the second pic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its fixed in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bastard file is the real name thats what i thought it was too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the yarnthread is wrapped around the metal part the bobbin i believe the ridges are simply to stop the thread from shifting and bunching up to one side as the thread is drawn out during each pass through the loom this way the thread will only move one direction off of the bobbin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you expand on your reasoning here it has many of the characteristics of a shuttle missing the end points i admit the inability to carry a spool is a bit damning but there could be more parts missing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and are a few similar ones it seems the metal plate is for holding the yarn spool in place as there is no rod for it

whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like one of the wax melts that yankee candle sells only its very melted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an old citronelapatio candle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,melts and reverts to normal size so what is the state in the picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would just guess it was a candle but op said it reverts to normal size which candle wax would not do it would melt into a new shape and then harden like that not revert to any former shape or size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i once watched a stresssqueezer ball rot in the sun over the course of several months this looks like what was left of it though i never touched or smelled it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably an old candle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it sticky it might be some kind of rosin for the bow hair of string instruments dont know of any brands that are green though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you live near the beach it sortof reminds me of a surfboard wax puck

whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like ski wax
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think i see a wick just above the exact center of the photograph
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be the multi correct and odor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats my guess i found a similar object several years ago and it ended up being a melted candle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most likely i found one in my grandmas yard years ago she forgot she left it out there and it somehow made its way to the yard for a couple of years under a bush this looks almost identical
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what if it screams
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no ones going to ask it you just happen to have a geiger counter laying around
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sputty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this matches it was found near a dog pen so probably a ball that melted it melts then goes back to the shape you see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i may have had a sex wax tshirt in the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the color reminds me of green antiinsect citronella candles

whatisthisthing,not_removed,while laughing diabolically
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seriously who doesnt the corona voltage regulator tube died right after i got an old meter just like yours so i scavenged the gm tube and built a digital counter around it posted a halfassed writeup and forgot about it until the fukushima disaster and suddenly cnet and everyone else was contacting me about diy geiger counters ive also got a well type scintillation counter somewhere that ones mostly cool for the old decatron tube with its spinning lights
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know now what to ask for xmas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would a candle revert after things got cool though it would just harden in its melted state
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i assume mine works it does have a test patch on the case and does measure but i do not have a gama radiation generator to test with but if i really needed one they can be found on amazon i live near oakridge tennessee so really needing one is possible civil defense cd radiological survey meter

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe these are markings for windows that should be broken in case of fire we had something similar in one of the office buildings i used to work in where the markings which were different from these i believe theyre defined by local governments on a township county level identified from the outside what windows should be broken and which correlated with signage in the office space in our case the building was a rectangle and we had these markings rally points at either end and in the middle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt think it was the type of glass but rather the position of the glass in relation to the building structures part of the required

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think its a vase because of how little could actually hold water take a look at the additional pictures i just posted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but what would be the purpose of the large rounded bit at the bottom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it need to hold water to be a vase im sure that plenty of them are just for decoration and not for actually storing anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks its a show piece its not meant to actually hold flowers or anything else
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you buy it seems pretty reasonable even as just a decorative object
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the top seems very shallow compared to the height of the item i dont think its a vase
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt buy it but a friend did the ornate metalwork sold it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,after googling around a bit it appaers that the httpsenwikipediaorgwikishortfinmakoshark is commonly caught and eaten in morocco shows another dead and disected mako shark which looks the like yours
whatisthisthing,not_removed,god dammit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems like a dead one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nsfw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its helpful it cant be seen well in the photo the head has a sort of chitinous inset horn sort of like that of a goblin shark but a lot smaller
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks fairly close only issue is that its a bit too small it seems that the nose becomes somewhat inset and dried out after its caughtslaughtered which broadens the possibilities beyond just sharks that naturally have a nose like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,um what
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks real helpful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the teeth shape clear lateral distinction between grey and white high on the body point to mako sand sharks are the only other species this size i know of which have similar teeth but they are triangular with a flat white belly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think people were expecting a picture of a slaughtered animal i wasnt maybe put a nsfw tag on it or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah youre definitely right ill declare this one solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah didnt even consider that sorry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think their dog doesnt like their car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the result of a chipmunk hiding from a dog same thing happened to my brothers car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its look like dogs teeth i once have a dog that bites car fenders every thunder storm he also build windows and doorway in his doghouse for the same reason
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an angry possibly cheated on screw driver
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cujo definitely cujo your car or just one you noticed and took a picture of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unless the piece was dented and was pulled out sometimes body shop guys will punch holes in the car to pull out the dent and then putty prime and paint it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed definitely animal teeth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats likely all plastic bumper cover up to the seam
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought this too but the holes look like they go in and were not pulled out also it looks like some holes were partially made from the other side so i think the dog idea is a good one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a for a httpsenwikipediaorgwikidistributedantennasystem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a cell tower see the microwave uplink dish on the top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did the city remove it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a small dome cover for a small lamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a safety shield for pendant lights goes over a small halogen bulb in the fixture if you dont clip it on just right hint the clip goes on the inside it eventually falls off onto your countertop where everyone wonders what it is and where it came from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,general shape is very much like a cupping glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a cupping glass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there we go solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely a squirrel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you truly meant flu i think she needs to see a doctor if you meant flue then its a squirrel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,squirrel they come in lots of sizes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just be glad it was kinda mummified we found one in my friends drain pipe and it was much much ickier
whatisthisthing,not_removed,poor lil guy rip squirrel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup like i said earlier a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is called a it is for cutting the stems of flowers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no cleaning instructions with it so she isnt even sure if it was for food looks like you pull the blade along something maybe for opening plastic packages of some sort googling has not helped at all
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i inherited something similar from my grandmother the style is called intaglio and was popular in the art deco era it looks like the image may have been a roman soldier such as this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most likely a wax seal ring or httpwwwfamilysealringscomfaqhtml more of a link to the ancestors than a practical ring now but you can still with sealing wax
whatisthisthing,not_removed,please be a badass stamp ring please be a badass stamp ring op probably
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aahah if it was a really cool insignia type thing that would be cool but unfortunately i dont have access to anything like that right now thankyou though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm okay the image doesnt really seem like its been worn down from its original design though and it doesnt look like it really resembles anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that shit is haunted i guarantee it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,silage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been sitting here watching several tractors working this pile for hours its at a meatpacking plant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a silage pile instead of just harvesting the corn they chop the entire plant and pack it into a pile so it ferments slightly then they feed it to livestock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,checked with the gate it is silage mainly corn kernals now but also other grains and even potato they had guys working on the pile with tractors hours a day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you say its at the meat packing plant ie on their property but to me it looks like an embankment for a freeway ramp and its going right next to some freeway lanes if im interpreting the picture correctly are you sure its related to the plant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes put it in a big pile cover with a sheet of air tight fabric or plastic put tires on top to keep the cover on as it ferments it uses up the oxygen and stops certain kinds of rot the fermentation partially digests the material and may make it more nutritious in some ways for animal feed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely its the color of sawdust or grain definitely not dirt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes its not dirt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rtrucking would probably be able to solve this in a jiffy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,isnt that wonderful weve moved from using icons to simplify our understanding of what a control for without words to making the function of a switch indecipherable fortunately on a freightliner the switch function is written in english on a tag that is wrapped around the harness that goes to each switch if youre super curious you can pop the dash panel a bit out even stick your head under the dash maybe and see what is connected to the switch good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,guard to prevent inadvertent activation in the neighborhood of other air accessories simple onoff labelling id guess auxiliarybackup compressor activator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there anything mentioned in the manual that isnt on your dash like engine fan switch or something maybe its a new look for whatever switch it is that didnt make it into the manual
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking an airbrake the icon sort of looks like a pivot door inside the exhaust just a guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a switch for the retarderjake brake
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rtrucking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it open a vent
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it have a bed heater that switch is usually installed by the bed co and doesnt show in manual typically just an air actuator moving a flap in the exhaust stream
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right its not in the manual and all of the switches that are referenced therein are clearly labeled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its not in the manual it is likely an accessory is this a used truck and do you know what is was used for previously
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jake brake page pdf page fig of looks most like it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its for the airbags on your drives you can deflate them helps when you drop a heavy loaded trailer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly a roll stability control switch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the compressor for your airbrakes or the actuator pump for your abs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jake brake would have a onoff and a level selector cyl usually
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the exhaust brake is on the other side of the dials in the picture and does look identical to fig of the manual when switched to the on position it sounds like an airway is closed when switched to the off position there is the sound of air bleeding off still havent the slightest idea what it does and so far none of the replys have the answer as far as i can tell tomorrow i will try posting this in the trucking subreddit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wouldnt that be the susp height switch above it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the one i was looking at crap never mind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwlampartnerscomportfolioatlanticwharf project foot decorative spire google maps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems to be an
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome man
whatisthisthing,not_removed,phone stand maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,both answers so far are correct here is an example
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yet another phone stand screen cleaner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive gotten some freebies like that with soft foam for cleaning your smart phone touch screen not sure about the cshaped part
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,holds a lighter maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is the part that hinges up hollow in that case its a portable ashtray the bottom section slides onto the table
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its that time of the week
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry for commercial link but this is right httpswwwqualitylogoproductscomdesktopitemsgogomobilephonestandscreencleanerhtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if people ask about these a lot ive never seen anything like it before and you cant really intuitively tell what it does
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so im not the only one who is sick to death of seeing these in here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its that time of the week day i may be wrong but this feels like the time this week these things have been posted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,having trouble finding a clear image of it but it looks like a sheaf of wheat in the center can anyone confirm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is not the same but it is entirely possible that it serves a similar purpose bannon is the only person ive seen wearing it though and given his history any symbolism he advances needs extra scrutiny sometimes he wears it upsidedown or rightside up to me it either looks like a golden crown or a golden female reproductive system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know thats a big damn pin and i think those are the curtains in the white house i wouldnt think hed need that in the building
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpswwwkeilerladendehardenberghtml httpsenwikipediaorgwikikornliquor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is german wheat alcohol kinda like everclear only lower proof and not made with corn like everclear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,paddle for an ice cream maker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ya got any more of them angles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it might be a shelf support of some kind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking it might be that but it looks a bit flimsy and usually both sides are flat the one in the pic has those notches on one side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my dad suspected this so i think thats confirmation they dont own the ice cream maker anymore solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a coral skeleton but odd that you found it in fresh water not sure how it got there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like rose brain coral mustve been dropped in by a person
whatisthisthing,not_removed,found this floating in a freshwater lake in pennsylvania its hard like a fossil or something no idea what the could be would love some ideas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats possible there are several houses on the lake maybe someone brought it in for some reason i was stuck thinking it was native to the area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the holes through it look like a vermitid gastropod a shellless snail that builds tubes to live in it looks like the coral overgrew it but the snail kept on building so they coexisted thats a pretty cool find this is not very old probably a modern coral rather than a fossil someone brought home from a trip to florida
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might want to xpost this to rbaseball and maybe even rnyyankees and rnewyorkmets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also try rautographassistance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a proto good one too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just sayingif you would have googled proto professional the first result would have answered your question
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i knew this one alas i was too late i commonly use em for working on guns and the like though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you selling it op
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what car do u have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tldr op doesnt know how to google
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a bigass drift
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a punch you hit it with a hammer to get a stuck pin or something out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you have your car serviced recently if so a mechanic is likely still trying to figure out where he put that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good until it got bent now just kind of ok
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but what is its use totally oblivious guy here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the one thing i knew what it was and i got beat to it can confirm have a nice proto set and several randoms in my tool box
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i work for the company that makes those for stanley proto those are some high quality punches were located in massachusetts and make punches chisels and prybars for all the big names in pro mechanics tools that should have a lifetime warranty though i doubt bent by a cars undercarriage is covered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah but if everyone used google this subreddit wouldnt exist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have to agree a lot of these posts are simple stuff i could find in seconds on google i feel like the subreddit should be about rareold items that are harder to identify instead of some crap you find on the ground that has obviously identification marks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree its really not that hard to google things even without words i once was going to post and ask the collective what it could be but just before hitting send i decided to rightclick and do a google image search on the second page of the search i found
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it became a pry bar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,punching things out of holes into holes or making punched holes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just have a drawer full of randoms myself a couple proto punches dont last long for me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the goal of this subreddit should actually be to educate people on how to do basic research with commonly available tools hence putting itself out of existence that is my view of it anyway education rather than spoonfeeding
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a lot of posts are obscure tools and doodads without text
whatisthisthing,not_removed,still useful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont see how this sub is in anyway promoting that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i said
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah this sub is more about finding out what a thing is after your attempts to google it have failed its purpose isnt to teach ppl to google
whatisthisthing,not_removed,read my more heavily downvoted posts they are the ones pointing out that the solution is a trivial google search or other lookup
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this sub should be more about finding out what a thing is after your attempts to google it have failed in order to get to that i try to point out the obvious google solutions there should probably be a tag for the posts that are shown to be trivially solvable with google this would illustrate the mix of stuff present
whatisthisthing,not_removed,photoshopped to look like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hallmark custom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you may want to try rbassguitar my guess is its a custom i dont recognize the logo on the headstock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was minutes late good call
whatisthisthing,not_removed,which is a replica of a mosrite ventures two pickup bass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpmsueanrmsuedunewswesternconiferseedbugorbrownmarmoratedstinkbug they look a lot like brown stinkbugs but are more elongated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a squished grasshopper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not an entomologist but it usually helps to say the general area youre in for species identifications theres a lot of bugs out there so narrowing it down a bit helps tremendously
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is difficult to see the markings under the screen but i believe it is a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwesternconiferseedbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,huh i was gonna say stinkbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,true im in houston tx anymore information just ask
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some googling it appears that it may be wow guild related
whatisthisthing,not_removed,personalized token used in geocaching i forget what nontrackable geocoins are called
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it appears to be a type of millstone used to break down grains for example into flour i live in the south and see them around often as far as the time period used no clue there but id start with millstone research good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a machined hole its not native american anything what is the material its made from im having a hard time making it out in my shitty phone which makes it look like styrofoam assuming its actually some sort of stone what does the other side look like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like your guess could also have been used as an actual drill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it almost looks like it was meant to hold something was it buried when she found it someone couldve drilled the hole to secure a canestyle gate latch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree i would say this with a whole lot of erosion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks very similar to this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup sd card its hard to see in the picture but it could be an adapter so you can fit a micro sd card in the bottom and read in in a standard sd slot httpsenwikipediaorgwikimemorycardmediafilesandiskmemorycardwithadapterjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry its a mini sd they are less common ×× mm ×× in heres a better picture httpsenwikipediaorgwikisecuredigitalmediafilesdcardssvg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sd cards come in different sizes thats an sd card
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a shelf width is adjustable it looks like it fits in a rack possible for a computer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rackmountable shelf
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an adjustable paper tray system and if you have three of that part that means youre missing pieces these would have clipped into something a metal track embedded in something or a stand alone metal frame these were more popular about years or more ago no one really uses garbage like this any more
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a laptop stand that serves two purposes first if you raise the rear part of the stand then it makes the laptop more comfortable to type on secondly raising it like that increases the airflow possible for the tiny laptop fans and helps keep the pc cool and allows it to run faster generally laptop intakes are on the bottom and sides exhaust out the back so these stands do help as you can see not all laptops are the same width so it can be expanded
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an adjustable tray to hold a monitor tilted forward a bit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unfortunately this is the only picture i have and i cannot get more my aunt took the picture and threw the thing away months ago i was reminded of this and decided to turn to the internet for assistance in identifying it assuming the owner of this thing is the son of my aunts boyfriend it is probably years old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say more likely a toy blackjack as the main part has fake stitching
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are many variations but basically it is a small handheld object used to knock someone out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,barclay cigarettes lighter with a piezoelectric sparking mechanism id put the design firmly in the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep thats a lighter ive got a working one just like it your second picture is of the electric spark mechnism that serves in place of flint
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it might have something to do with barclays bank which i think became hsbc the font is the same perhaps it was a giveaway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any idea how i could fix it then all i would need to do is fill it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was midlands bank that became hsbc barclays is still the same bank if it was a promotional item it would be barclays with an s and the bank logo so its likely the owners name
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would first fill it and see if it works the plastic part is a common piezoelectric igniter there should be a visible spark between the end of the wire and where the fuel comes out if not remove any corrosion and make sure the end of the wire is close millimeters to where the fuel comes out if needed you could find a replacement igniter online or cannibalize one from another lighter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh dear of course its been such a long time since i moved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,know any brand of lighter that uses the same model of igniter pref available in the uk and cheap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im no expert but i have repaired a couple lighters before most igniters are very similar try your luck with any cheapo one from a gas station
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not a whole lot to go on there but it sort of looks like the bottom of a loom to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a loom like one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved yep that was fast thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved interesting that we both used the same photo thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,schrader valve core tire valve stem core
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aka the weird valve
whatisthisthing,not_removed,schrader is weird
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry got it confused with a presta valve
whatisthisthing,not_removed,assuming you are in north america wasps httpsenwikipediaorgwikiyellowjacket they are chewing and predigesting the meat to bring back to the hive for the young larvae feed on proteins derived from insects meats and fish which are collected by the adults which chew and condition them before feeding them to the larvae
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those look like wasps or yellow jackets not bees
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are httpsenwikipediaorgwikiyellowjacketlifecycleandhabits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are wasps and one blowfly edit spell correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can tell it is a frog because of the webbed foot on the right side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sweet meat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,us cent counterstamped with the image of king tut as a souvenir of the treasures of his tomb touring the us
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i tried searching for that and couldnt find anything do you have a link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no im a coin collector and have just seen these before
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i didnt realize the exhibit had been as huge as that article describes the souvenir coins i found pictures of online are the flattened pennies that you can make at any museum but it sounds like youve seen ones just like this one before in person
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have i was a little kid when king tut was at chicagos field museum back in the late they had a machine that made these i got one while i was there on a school field trip info on tutmania httpinteractivewttwcomrememberingchicagotutmaniafieldmuseum
whatisthisthing,not_removed,trying to figure out if we have carpenter ants its probably about a quarter to a half inch long sorry no banana for scale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good call ill try over there trying to figure out if we have carpenter ants
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do be sure to try over there but i would guess that it is in fact a carpenter based on size and body shape
whatisthisthing,not_removed,watering spike fill with water and stick next to a plantwaters slowly at the roots
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah im gonna have to agree that its the plant water thing but if the hole is only at the tip i reckon itd make an ok portable water balloon filler in a pinch or maybe an industrialstrength at home enema
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you have your answer but i cant help but wonder how it would be on a mentos and diet coke lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,attach it to a hose or faucet and fill water balloons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i use one for bbq flare ups
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the right answer fill with water invert and stick into the dirt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gzactly just bought a few for our pots additional tips add fertilizer to the water jam toilet paper or similar down into the cone to adjust flow use larger or smaller bottles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good luck with that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,water isnt supposed to be used with grease fires just an fyi the grease will sit on top of the water and spread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what so are we just supposed to douse pounds of flour or baking soda all over the bbq that has meat spread all over it have you ever even cooked in your life no waitbreak out the fire extinguisher which is full of chemicals and spray that all over the family bbq you are thinking of when a shallow pan of oil gets left on the stove and starts to smoke and has a chance of catching fire thats when you dont use water turn off the heat and move the pan carefully away from the heat source if it has caught fire already then flour will put it out or use a dampnot dripping wetkitchen towel and cover the pan and do not move it learn to cook and learn to manuver your way around the kitchen and quit giving bad advice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwcleverclocksusacomhexagonhtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,please provide a side angle shot how large is this i run wwwredditcomrskulls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a raccoon skull
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do an internet search dental formula for animals it will show you how to easily identify skulls by counting tooth sockets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,work in a zoology museum with skulls definitely racoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a canine skull some kind of dog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where abouts on vancouver island
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id say bear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,human
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a seal skull to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the eye to nose distance in relation to the rest of the skull as well as the relatively large canines lead me to think bear side shot would be nice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry for the delay httpsimgurcomgallerypppro and its about long high and wide
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had the same thought especially with the fur
whatisthisthing,not_removed,work in a donut shop with cooking utensils definitely racoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op just posted dimensions long high and definitely a raccoon far too small to be a bear it wasnt easy to get a visual sense of scale from this photo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but what kind is best
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks more like a bird pelvis to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im going to guess pacific rim highway just outside the parkits just a feeling i have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op said its long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the procyonids of which raccoons are an example are another family of carnivores that exhibit omnivory biology is pretty unforgiving when it comes to absolute statements
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the skull of a raccoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and the grey fur
whatisthisthing,not_removed,false black bears
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i got the joke
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lolwut
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you miss the canines the teeth the lower mandible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id be happy finding a raccoon skull near my house because that means its one less of the bastards assaulting my compost bin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,now i know why the other guy stopped naming his garage racoons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,feeling out of the loop on this could you elaborate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rspecies as well as this subreddit are frequently asked to identify an odd skull which doesnt appear to resemble any known skulls the op is always mistaking a cormorant pelvis for a skull source i did it once too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh thanks didnt really catch that i discovered this sub quite recently and havent yet seen that reoccur as im sure many of you have yeah there are indeed some pretty cool looking pelvises out there which really seem rather skullish when one doesnt know yet how to identify what it is done this likewise myself still i liked to try and imagine as a kid what the animal would look like if that was an actual skull cheers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a jews harp really google it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as wikipedia says jews harp also known as the jaw harp mouth harp ozark harp or juice harp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn i thought i was finally going to get one minutes late
whatisthisthing,not_removed,has one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jews harp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a jaw harp or jews harp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool to play with almost harmonica type fun but really rough on your front teeth if you position it incorrectly in your lips good find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in german its called a mouth drum maultrommel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wasnt first to say jews harpjaw harp but here is a cute video of none other than with his buddy woodstock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these things are actually pretty cool to play come in different keys and can sound totally different based on how where you position it and how you shape your mouth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the jews harp was popular during the american civil war it sounds pretty cool when you know how to play it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my dad had one always called it a mouth harp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,somewhere theres a jew wandering in the desert looking for his lost harp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we called them a juice harp slang is jews harp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn lmao solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh no you racist didnt you learn anything from pepe the frog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and i think the one this week
whatisthisthing,not_removed,got to be quick to compete with us knights of new
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yessiri even bought a mouth harp that came in a snoopy case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had to look this up apparently jews harp predates juice harp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my mother could play one quite well believe it or not there is a trick to getting just the right boing i have tried to get it but i think my jowls are just too flabby
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its is an indian musical instrument called morsing its also called the jaw harp look up wikipedia for information
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also called ozark harp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its ni new ni ni
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we had them as kids never knew the difference however it does make a fitting httpsenwikipediaorgwikieggcorn reddits new word of the day

whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure looks like something in that family
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikisliderule its calculating device mostly to do multiplication but a few other operations depending on the particular model
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you very nearly had its name httpsenwikipediaorgwikisliderule
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i graduated high school in college bound seniors were advised not show up without a typewriter and if you were taking any technical courses also a slide ruler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn i am old i used one of these in high school
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was in the last class in my school to be taught how to use one we also had a class in computer programming we used with acoustic coupler modems and paper tape for storage nice username
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsyoutubewaiprjuevpq
whatisthisthing,not_removed,multiplication is easy move the on the left edge of the c scale over the first number on the d scale then slide the clear graticule to the second number on the c scale read the product off the d scale you have to keep track of the decimal point in effect you are adding two logarithms together logxylogxlogy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what year was that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exact same situation for me but it was circa maybe my high school was just a bit behind the times
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my hs stopped using them in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and more than years later i can still remember the smell of that paper tape that was used in the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup i was a couple of years after you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it should be a httpepyimgcomtycdnsportsimportssuvvanbackupmirrorjpg for seeing directly behind the rear of a large vehicle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that makes sense they need to clean it haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would agree that it is sap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its sap and yes its coming from the board itself you can see how it matches the grain pattern underneath
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like some type of stinkhorn and the flies back that up but maybe go with the bot and post over at mycology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,suburbs about miles north of philadelphia weve had a lot of rainfall recently so mushrooms galore but ive never seen one like this worried about possible toxicity to my dogs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep looks like your typical stinkhorn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as said its a suppressor for tanks not in the traditional way that its not attached to the tank it was made by rheinmetall for shooting ranges in germany so they wouldnt bother the surrounding communities side view with the balls taken offhttpiimgurcomrptqdqujpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tank silencer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,technically thats not a tank its an howitzer its selfpropelled artillery used to lob shells on enemy positions structures etc tanks are primarily for use on other armored vehicles so everything im reading on the internet says that is indeed a suppressor for a howitzer and the image is real and why not theres no such thing as an idea too crazy for the military to try at least once
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a tank silencer or sound suppressor makes the tank more stealthy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i grew up next to huge army training base for machine guns i was by the time i figured out its weird to have machine gun fire always in the background its like having a train track nearby after a while you dont even notice the train anymore
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does anyone have a video of a tank firing with the silencer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not real is acceptable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks exactly like the ball launchers from rocket league training mode
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with much military info snobbery i want to add a few points to what is this it is a noise suppressor but not for tanks these are self propelled artillery pieces the article that someone linked to says this somewhere major differences tank is a direct fire weapon artillery is indirect fire weapon a tank rides into battle guns a blazing a whoopin and a whoppin everthing in site artillery the biggest killer on the battlefield sits back behind the front lines lobbing copius amounts of death and destruction apunxt the enemy or who and whatever ends up being in the targeted area the piece pictured here is artillery with a noise suppressor quite ridiculous and only imaginable in this era of kinder gentler military
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there any video of it in use im curious to see how much it actually silences the howitzer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,here are some pics to see how they put that together
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why is it camouflaged if its not for fighting with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any idea why they painted it in camouflage colors seems a bit pointless to me if its not intended to be used in battle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,anyone especially exmilitary will gladly let you know just how big the bang is from a large caliber i was driving behind one once when it fired i damned near lost control of the car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to be perfectly honest i thought you were entirely joking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres no such thing as an idea too crazy for the military to try at least once this guy knows his shit upvoting for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tech this guy knows his shit upvoting for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,technically this guy knows his shit upvoting for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,technically thats not a tank its an howitzer this guy knows his shit upvoting for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am sure you know this stuff better than i do but i could swear this is the german panzerhaubitze
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think tanks are actually more useful for infantry support killing other tanks is primarily left to aircraft
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks a helluva lot like a tank so how isnt it a tank
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well put sir
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ever heard of planes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so serious question what exactly does one hope to achieve with silent artillery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wondered if apunxt was actually a word it isnt but this reddit post was the third result on google
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i miss living by active military ranges all of the firing explosions mechanical sounds and what not are really soothing to me i got so used to having noise at night during my time in the military that i have a hell of a hard time going to sleep when its quiet in order to feel comfortable and fall asleep quicker i will usually leave my laptop open playing a youtube military documentary or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when i was a kid my family and i lived in an old camper in an rv park on hwy real close to eglin afb for a while i know the sounds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they were probably worried that if they didnt specify the paint the contractor would deliver it in pink
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because thats what the specs called for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well you dont want it to clash with the tank now do you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my hootch in afghanistan was about meters from a couple of guns there was a hesco wall between the two locations that was wide and high the concussion would just roll over that thing like it wasnt there and knock over any precariously placed items quite a wake up at in the morning lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so its not solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tanks missed opportunity
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not tank though its selfpropelled artillery but yes its a silencer i dont think such thing is used during war time its just to keep town nearby happy during training
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope but i dont know as much as all these other folk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we tried lsd as a combat enhancement drug we sewed explosives into bats to try to burn down tokyo we put a tank cannon on the nose of the we built a tank why because the us armys catchphrase is it seemed like a good idea at the time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its stupid but it works is still works
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you may be right i saw reference to both vehicles i think its a because if you look at the back of the turret the is more squared with straighter lines up the sides and across the top much more trapezoidlike the panzerhaubitze turret is much more rounded across the top reminds me of a camper top the bottom of the vehicle from the rear does look more like a panzerhaubitze im no expert though i just went with the consensus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uhurricaneflats quoted some differences but lighter armor isnt the main difference tanks are typically directfire systems they point the gun at the bad guys more or less within visual range and usually with lineofsight and fire it they may have to arc it a bit to compensate for gravity over distance but its still a roughly straight shot the projectile from a tanks gun is usually highervelocity than that from a howitzer howitzers are indirectfire weapons their rounds go in a much higher arc and they often do not see their targets they may fire over great distances and will often not have lineofsight theres a lot more math involved in firing a howitzer and youll often have a forward observer aka fox to indicate where targets are and what theyre doing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiselfpropelledartillery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but wouldnt it be more costeffective and efficient to only use one colour paint rather than
whatisthisthing,not_removed,carc is some nasty stuff too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seeing as though it is only used for training the camo is pointless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,death from above
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from other comments in the thread its apparently for practice ranges to avoid disturbing surrounding people
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good question this whole device is worthless from a military perspective worse really it seems like people who live close to firing ranges complained about the noise so somebody came up with the idea of a silencerand probably made a significant political contribution and got a contract to make it the beauty of modern self propelled artillery is that it is supposed to be able to roll into a firing position and be able to provide indirect fire support very quickly then to protect against aggressive counterbattery fire they pack up roll to a new firing position and fire again this all happens km behind front lines speed is very important noise does not matter even if it were totally silent enemy radar if employed can track the shells and trace them back to the firing position in seconds the radar sends targeting info to its own artillery which fires a shtstorm of shells back to where the shells came from this is counter battery fire if it is being used an artillery unit might pull in fire salvos then haul ashes speed is the most important thing besides accuracy of course
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its used on a training ground to shoot without harassing the neighbourhood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very interesting i cant claim credit for the word stole it from a squidbillies episode could not find that quote but here are some good ones somebody put in that innernet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can i sell you an exotic holiday in syria then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,live near randolph afb got used to random heli and growlly plane sounds really quick heard a more highpitched screechy sound one day looked up thunderbirds flying overhead in formation apparently they were practicing for the airshow the next day made for a nice lunch treat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i live pretty close to camp lejeune in jacksonville nc and hearing the ospries fly over the faint sound of artillery testing and the very faint trumpet playing which could be a nearby high school but it sounds like its coming from the base are all very comforting sounds to me people around here dont even hear the noises half the time and when you do its easy to ignore if i end up moving out of here im going to miss those sounds
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i live just north of hurlburt and i agree even the jets and helicopters flying over are awesome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we used to live near fort hood the first several years were miles east of the base it took some getting used to but the noise from the artillery range could be heard at all hours when we moved to copperas cove just a few miles west of the base man we could hear all kinds of stuff helicopters planes tanks plus the artillery i taught at old junior high there and those huge cargo planes would fly over the campus from time to time and it would feel like everything was going to shake apart we loved all of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i miss titan ivbs the newer boosters lack the bigass solid rocket boosters that make most of the noise and light a titan iv taking of miles away would rattle your whole body a nighttime titan ii launch would look like a very rapid sunrise with crazy shadows everywhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,take a vacation to slab city in southern california then very active aerial gunnery range that also hosts artillery and ground troop exercises right up against the place its the chocolate mountains aerial gunnery range cmagr and you are at times only or miles from exploding ordnance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can relate my childhood house was right off a runway that was a small military base when i left of college and came back i really could tell that i missed the jets sometimes in full afterburner screaming towards the gulf shaking the windows and generally being pretty awesome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i live in crestview and can hear them from here the one thing i love though is driving down by the runway under a landing jet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought the whole point of war was to clash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved false true
whatisthisthing,not_removed,surprisingly the bat thing was amazingly successful in tests but didnt go forward as wed spent enough on the bomb where you couldnt just say screw that and do the bat plan it would have been devastating to any city repeatable at a far faster rate than the bomb at a fraction of the cost and we had to show russia who was boss so we went nuke
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you say tried as if we dont currently take lsd before combat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we put a tank cannon on the nose of the id heard of the others but hadnt heard of this anyone know more about this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what tank was tons and feet long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont forget pigeonguided bombs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they tried to train pidgens to make airplane identifications for combat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sounds like a good way to start a novel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right its an i found a picture from another angle its a bit clearer on this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,new guy has to practice on something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if they use one color then there will be less of that color if they always use all three then they can resupply by ordering all three at once
whatisthisthing,not_removed,deployment ready is the point plus its the army most things they do are pointless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,silent but death from above
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool thanks for the detailed info response highlights it as even more ridiculous than it looks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fair enough but would have thought these firing ranges training grounds would have been remote enough to not make this a huge issue not like you can silence the target area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,watched the whole clip didnt hear it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i prefer iraq i know the baghdad area a lot more sadr city even more so i can tell you where to get a bomb ass falafel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thunderbirds will be at kellylackland november
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my dad was in the marine corps and we lived on lejeune for over years growing up the trumpet sound you are hearing may be whats called colors or taps they play colors in the morning and the evening when they raise and lower the flag at one of the main buildings on base the whole base comes to a stop if you can hear it cars will stop in the middle of the road taps is played later at night meaning lights out it is also played at military funerals as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wouldnt that mean wwiii began so noise is not the primary concern
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im kinda conflicted about this on the one hand they do sound amazing to me on the other hand theres a lot of people in the world who hate that sound because it means their hometowns getting bombed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sounds like freedom delivery devices what an incredibly asinine thing to say people die to that sound there is no glory or freedom in your militaristic fetish just pain and hatred
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we live south of fort wayne indiana and they have an airbase close by i love looking up and seeing and such go over
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i miss the sonic booms disrupting my teachers in the portable classrooms that were like shipping containers with a blackboard at one end
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was so successful that when some of the bats were released accidentally escaped they blew up a fuel tank on the airfield they were kept at the bats were strapped with napalm canisters rigged to a timer put into hibernation placed in a large canister and dropped from a plane the idea was that they would wake up mid descent and find a place to roost places like eaves under vehicles and bridges the timer would go off their napalm canisters would explode and tahdah hundreds of fires over a mile radius in cities made of paper many bats lost their lives millions of dollars were spent an airfield on american soil was set aflame and the government didnt even have the decency to call it something like project combat what a waste
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well it turns out that wasnt us anyway it was a navy thing so yeah
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bruh i dont know what kind of shit your unit gets up to but i have never been dropkicked by an nco and i dont want to start right before going out on mission
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so this explains ptsd
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mean thats the other school of thought yeah but if the planes going forwards it makes sense to direct the recoil straight back since that wont throw the plane sideways in the air like it does to fire the on the spooky
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive fixed the post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was closer to tons but whats tons between friends
whatisthisthing,not_removed,goggles ton feet tank im guessing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that idea was the stupidest and most creative thing that anyone seriously considered doing during the war
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it would never be used away from training the days itd take to set it up the enemy would have moved on or would have attacked the position
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thats why i said i could not find the exact quote and posted that link as a sample
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i could never hear it well enough to distinguish what it was exactly and my dad was in the military for years hence why i live in a military town it was surreal seeing everybody stop when taps started playing when we first moved here from california
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i actually meant to say delta ii the titan ivs and delta iis were solely spacelift for launching satellites the titan iis did start out as icbms but some were converted for satellites after retirement they didnt have such a bright flame since they were liquid fueled only now the peacekeepers made some racket when they were in service now the only icbms they test are the minuteman iiis which are loud enough to wake me up and rattle the windows but nothing like the old titans
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup but where i live whenever they get scrambled its likely something in trouble in the gulf so theyre doing more searching and less bombingshooting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you mean liberated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well they use them where i live when there is immediate need for assistance in the gulf they send these guys screaming out and hopefully help whatever ship is in trouble sending the coast guard better info for he choppers they send
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not dieing they are being liberated from the confines of their earthly bodies its the ultimate form of freedom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my father flew helicopters so we both get a kick seeing them fly over as well my dad was flying after an air show once and there was a bomber that took off did a low pass and then shot straight up to feet nearly vertical shook the whole heli that my father was taxiing over amazing stuff but i kinda wish we had a more varied assortment of planes there its just two fighter jets but we do have about different helicopter models that come out of there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that timing right here i almost spat my coffee all over the place i salute you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,us as in the us we were all kind of a united front it was canceled because it wouldnt have been ready until mid summer a couple other interesting things happened to occur around that time ill be lazy and copy wikipedia more tests were scheduled for the summer of but the program was cancelled by fleet admiral ernest j king when he heard that it would likely not be combat ready until by that time it was estimated that million had been spent on the project it is thought that development of the bat bomb was moving too slowly and was overtaken in the race for a quick end to the war by theatomic bomb project dr adams maintained that the bat bombs would have been effective without the devastating effects of the atomic bomb he is quoted as having said think of thousands of fires breaking out simultaneously over a circle of forty miles in diameter for every bomb dropped japan could have been devastated yet with small loss of life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well bats do swim so i guess that makes sense
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think hes got the army and marine corps mixed up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,put it in the tail then you gain airspeed with every shot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,stupidest when i was in college i took a psych class from a guy that did experiments with pigeons hed trained to use touch screens we all had to schedule a time to go in to the lab and take the same test as the pigeons it was pretty simple just touch the right button as soon as it lights up on the screen i asked the lab tech afterwards if i did as well as a pigeon he said almost but the pigeons always win i still think if we got food pellets then we might have tried harder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i first read it as being offered a really good assflavored falafel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is sarcasm right right guys
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and americans still wonder why people want to fly jets into their buildings the brainwashing is working like a charm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i remembered it wrong it was a not a gun mounted offset to port in the nose like the avenger is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and middle easterners still wonder why americans want to fly drones into their weddings
whatisthisthing,not_removed,typing on phone while walking all in all i think i did ok oh christjust hit by a car but i found this important enough to still reply

whatisthisthing,not_removed,how old are you how did you become such a vile excuse of a human being is it the lead poisoning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aye it was a regular howitzer transplanted into the aircraft
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn is a hell of an air to air gun lol you know it was a ground pounder as a matter of interest the uk did the same thing with a mosquito and the germans did the same with the hs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was used against ships frequently and worked well in that role

whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually it is httpsenwikipediaorgwikitheobromacacao
whatisthisthing,not_removed,disagree ops pods are curved have a different profile and are not as clustered as these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know what those are theyre drink cozies you put them on for instance an oldfashioned glass so they dont leave rings or condensation for use instead of coasters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,golf club head covers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are too small to be soft drink can cozies they fit almost perfectly over a ounce can of tomato paste aprox inches long x inches wide both ends are open with one end having a narrow strip of elastic sewn on the edge but it is still visibly open appears to be elasticized tube type of material
whatisthisthing,not_removed,leg warmers for babies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking they might be picc line covers for a small child but tbh i know nothing about what they can be made of only that they exist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,random guess but they could be egg warmers you put them over your soft boiled egg in an egg cup to keep it warm after cooking during breakfast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we had some open ended knit tubes that looked similar to these they didnt fit over anything wide but came with special slender aluminum drinking glasses this was the early both the aluminum glasses and the cozies have gone out of style but show up in antique stores on occasion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess thats possible dont know if that is a thing or not forgot to mention that they were found in the drawer of an old farm house
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know if its right or not but i like this guess id like it better if one end was totally closed but i still think this is a good possibility thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my grandparents had two sets like this one for oldfashioneds and one for wineglasses which looked like flat rings they were in gift boxes they never used them and were from the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh its a thing source my wife bought about of them over the course of babies as far as i can tell they mostly end up in the laundry im not sure they often got used on baby legs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think anyone ever used them ours were still in the original box till when my dad downsized everyone had them tho
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok thanks i believe you when you say they are a thing but im still not sure that this is the answer mostly because i would expect the colors to be in matching pairs but they are all different also they are only four inches long seems too short even for babies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought i should keep them the sentiment of it but then caught myself and thought let someone else get freaked out about putting sweat socks on their drinks they went to a charity pick up a couple years ago for all i know theyll turn up on this subreddit soon enough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure these are for babies but mismatched socksleg stuff for babies is a thing too you can buy sets where no two match but then you dont have to search for the mate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i completely understand its tempting to save everything sentimental but you have to draw the line somewhere and those are things that we both know would never be used it would be wild if you saw them on rthriftstorehauls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup and while i cant say much for the leggings the mix and match socks are fantastic much easier than finding a matched set of tiny socks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive often wondered if the giant pile of stuff i had to give away would show up on reddit somewhere i think id fall over laughing yeah it was tough trying to pick and choose all their stuff combined with mine thank goodness for freecycle and doorstep charity pick ups
whatisthisthing,not_removed,has there been anything that you now wish you had back occasionally ill think of something that i saw daily as a kid and want to kick myself for getting rid of it on the other hand it would just be dumpster fodder for my kids
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my grandparents had an outdoor set they used indoors it was mustard yellow solid aluminum and schlocky my spouse convinced me to rehome it and i regret it all the time it was four chairs and a glasstopped table
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i remember those sets thats a bummer that you dont have it anymore i hope at some point youll be reunited with it stranger things have happened i just recently found my parents old hifi stereo at a thrift store after it had been given away about years ago so maybe your grandparents table set will come back around

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like an asp to me i live in southeast texas and see these alot got severely stung by one a few years ago and it left a nasty scar in the form of a huge permanent pigment free splotch on my leg it suckedill never forget it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most people around here call it a woolly worm httpsenwikipediaorgwikipyrrharctiaisabella come in banded solid black and solid white colors and some people believe they predict the type of winter that will come by their coloring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sweet do you happen to know if they slime theres a whole lot of slime on my stoup
whatisthisthing,not_removed,worst than a brown recluse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so what does all black mean are we all gonna die oo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they should not slime
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if theres residue on your stoup its likely poop they shouldnt slime
whatisthisthing,not_removed,different than a brown recluse an asp has stinging fibers or hairs that delivers the sting feels like burning that can only be likened to the all of the fires of hell rolled up and placed on your skin a recluse will bite you and possibly lay an egg or two its venom will necrotize the site so as to feed the babies eventually there will be an infection and the tissue will have to be removed leaves a hideous scar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all black means the winter will be mild because there is no brown stripe all white means that the winter will be reaally bad the size of the brown stripe usually denotes the harshness of the winter fun fact there is a httpwwwwoollywormcom

whatisthisthing,not_removed,capped off gas pipe for a gas light had some in my last house but im in the uk they can be hard to remove without doing a lot of damage to the wall so are often left in place
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree that this is the capped end of a gas pipe likely for gas lighting its a common find in old houses our home was built in and we have a few of them it may or may not still be connected to your system so dont do anything with it until youve had the gas company or a plumber check it out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was probably for an old fixture or radiator does the house have or used to have a boiler if youre worried theres live wire under there get a tester before poking anything into it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like some type of capped pipe could be electrical conduit gas line or water line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,being next to a window like that i would say thats a capped off gas line for what was a wall sconce why they capped it off there and not inside the wall idk ive found capped off gas lines in my ceiling from hanging gas lights before live in boston as others have said dont screw with it bc it may or may not still be connected some water lines or connections to long since dismantled radiators are sometimes like this but water lines are of course in kitchens and bathrooms mostly and radiator connections are usually low on the wall or in the floor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just as an aside httpsenwikipediaorgwikiknobandtubewiring doesnt refer to knobs in the sense of switches it refers to the way the wires were run in the wall porcelain tubes to insulate where the wire went through a joist or stud and a knob to support the wire along a distance or for a change in direction suh as around a corner httpwwwcarsondunlopcomwpcontentuploadsknobandtubeconnectionsjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it behind a door if so it could be a really old door stop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the capped end of gas pipe it looks a little too high up and thin to be a radiator pipe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i second the radiator suggestion sometimes they had piping running from above when heating systems get changed over the years or if it was deteriorated galvanized piping it may have been cappedoff and abandoned second guess would be a gas line for an old gas light fixture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks its not bothering us so were going to leave it alone radiators would make sense in a couple places around the house weve noticed areas in the molding at the bottom of the walls where it looks like a circle of wood was cut out then replaced with different wood we were thinking that might indicate where radiators used to be central forced air now thank goodness

whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are usually just fibreglass as far as i know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no it is fiberglass with some of the epoxy resin eroded by exposure to sunlight
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they did make some corrugated asbestos panels but they were opaque and thinker than that they were heavy too the panel in the image is fiberglass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree its fiberglass i wasnt able to find any information about asbestos being used in translucent plastics it looks to me like httpwwwcranecompositescombpcorrugatedhtml which has simply weathered to expose the fiberglass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you dont really know unless you test it but the fibers are probably glass if nothing else i think asbestos is usually much thinner than that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the asbestos ones have more of a cement board look and feel to them pretty safe until you start breaking them up and releasing the fibres the ones youve got there are fibreglass ones
whatisthisthing,not_removed,horrible green moldy and falling apart fiber glass

whatisthisthing,not_removed,reminds of a price of the type of belt him morrison wore like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say beltbuckle the backside shows that is indeed a belt buckle i dont have a reference of what exactly it is but its not military related
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im wondering if it was not completed the flower itself is symmetric so i am wondering if someone started trimming the excess metal from the cast but never finished
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that style of belt is called a concho belt the metal pieces are the conchos they are usually silver is this piece magnetic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,only the part you attach the belt to and the prong appear to be magnetic the rest is not magnetic as far as i can tell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool def a buckle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it might be this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the rims or the tires the tires should have a size embossed on the side the rims just specify the make and year eg vw beetle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a centerline but i have never seen a centerline brand with blue rivets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like with the center cap taken of and the rivets dabbed with blue dye
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are on a vw beetle and he is looking to get a spare set but he cant find the name edit its the rims not the tires
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the only info i have really i dont think the rims are the originals just trying to help with info and its the rims hes looking for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are custom rims not original equipment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are centerline style thats for sure

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely not a camera with that lens in front it looks like a motion sensor to me probably based on infrared which can penetrate plastics like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the most common way of motiondetecting is pir passive infrared ir light can pass trough thin plastics almost unobstructed

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the metal part thats the temperature sensor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks so it is actally part of the thermostat it was attached to the tube leading to the radiator before i unwinded it where do i have to put it to work properly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its meant to be placed in a location that is representative of the rooms temperature as opposed to being right next to the radiator which is usually quite warm in comparison
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some advice on positioning the remote sensor httpwwwaelheatingcouktrvremotesensor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,specifically there is a gas in the bulb and when it heats up it exerts pressure on the mechanism in the knob via the little thin wire which is actually a tube be careful if you flex the tube too much it can break and then the radiator wont turn on any more the adjustment knob applies force via a spring to countermand the pressure of the gas in the tube if you turn the heat up it reduces the force and the gas in the tube has to expand less and produce a lower pressure to open the valve its quite the clever completelymechanical solution to making a thermostat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmm that seems different from what ive been told in the past interesting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you thats interesting the tube was already bent like that when i moved in is there a way to test if it still works properly likeputting the sensor outside where it has only °c and see if the radiator turns on also are the tresholds always and °c like in the link from evilmike
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you wanted to test it you could probably just put it in a glass of ice water saving you from having to try to straighten out that rats nest of tubing which as mentioned is easy to damage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the thresholds are in all likelyhood kind of arbitrary they may be targeting some denomination like the ones in the link but the mechanical tolerances required to maintain that precision would make the things prohibitively expensive its probably better to just think of it as cold warm hot etc the tube should be relatively durable my point was more to avoid sharp kinks like bending it around a sharp edge or repeatedly flexing it in the same place just unrolling it and sticking it somewhere further from the radiator shouldnt affect it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you very much very kind of you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it does not connect to anything on the inside it may be a remnant from a drain vent i am guessing that there used to be a drain line attached that was no longer needed after a remodel they left the pipe out of convenience
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have an air conditioning unit in your attic could be the drain for one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,squirrel and mouse door how thoughtful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a possible rain outlet a pic of the other side of the roof could provide some insight dewitt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it a vent for the attic have you tried putting a stick into the pipe is it a rental
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if the pipe is open on the other side maybe its a half ass attempt at soffit or attic ventilation i dont see any cut into the soffit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive installed similar pipes to run satellite tv coax lines through this may be a stubout conduit for that purpose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could have been a pass through for antenna and control wiring for a tv cb or ham radio installation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the pipe doesnt connect to anything once it passes though the screen its just floating there

whatisthisthing,not_removed,my coworkers and i decided this guy had an amazing train set and this thing held a harness whereby he could hang over the train set to work on the scenery were only half kidding
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a standard lazy susan bearing my first thought is that it would be used to mount a wall projector but im not sure why youd need that much mobility on it and in an unfinished basement
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i suppose you didnt see where that ancient cord went did you the lazy susan is actually mounted pretty ingeniously they mounted the lower part to the base and the upper part the part closer to the base is what spins this makes sense because thats how ball bearings are meant to work but it shows a bit of ingenuity i have few guesses aside from its meant to hang something not terribly heavy and rotate and slide back and forth maybe for dressing deer or other small animals thats why id be interested in seeing where that cord went
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you reckon that rail in the middle was electrified at some point looks like the component that the wires are connected to slides back and forth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,first thought was a mount for some kind of darkroom equipment like an enlarger could also have been for some type of power tool definitely looks homemade
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is the room large enough to necessitate disco lighting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sex swing mount
whatisthisthing,not_removed,indoor crop growing lights moved across to simulate the sun old school
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does the cord look contemporary to the rest of the hardware the cord looks very old as you say i personally cant tell about the lazy susan mount and the rest of it my thought was that its for lighting but really thats just a guess as a custommade contraption a definitive answer may be elusive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,took some more pictures for you besides the small black thing i dont know where the cord goes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking it would be a mount for a camera to shoot from overhead but that wouldnt need a cord a moveable lighting rig would though so it could still be studio based hmm what if he had a studio for shooting stop motion films putting a camera on a rig kinda makes sense for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at what size would disco lighting be necessary for a room
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he was a grower confirmed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it does appear that the cord is plugged into a long continuous outlet so that the plug itself can slide with the rest of the thing i cant see anywhere that power comes through the base to feed whatever was hanging from it though of course it could just be hidden i wouldnt have any problem believing it was for some kind of spotlight that needed to be mobile for some reason maybe they made homemade blue movies ha i just noticed there is a big hole in the center of the thing i assume the cord came down through that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah ok the trol e duct is indeed an electrical mechanism for running a power to that sled as it moves back and forth not sure why tho gis for trol e duct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it also slides the other way did you notice that i mean the sled slides back and forth but the rails it is on also move perpendicular to that also when i said the cord was ancient in googling it looks like troleduct stuff was from the late and into the could be newer of course but that cord actually looks like it may be from wwii era
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i noticed the ability of it to move the other way as well but it was bolted in that spot as you can see in the second picture of the album whatever this was for im guessing it hasnt been used in a very long time the house was built in so it being that old checks out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a book binder to me

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i checked the internet movie car database imcdborg and didnt find anything osirus osiris was an egyptian god so i thought maybe the first stargate series but didnt find anything i looked through lists of american scifi series from the but didnt find anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mega force
whatisthisthing,not_removed,def oldsmobile silos probably from a mini seriestv show or low budget film the rims still have the oldsmobile logos might even have been in the og v i recall some vehicles in that mini series
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i contacted the movielots company and they said the vehicle is from a production that hasnt been released yet so they could not tell me sounds odd though because the van is so old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry they are in the states place called moviesets in louisiana they had a bunch of cars outside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i worked at the plant that manufactured the passenger doors body side and tailgate they were known as the u body van i used to joke about how big the dash was some people put a plastic jesus on their dash you can put a whole nativity scene on the dash of these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can we get the years this van was made will help narrow down the search assuming the makers were going for a futuristic looking car id bet these were used while in they were still being made
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i scanned through the movie but could not find the vehicle the name osirus fits and the year is right though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was my first thought but those vehicles were a lot more stylized and there were no minivans in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no definitely not megaforce
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,place called moviesets in louisiana the name of the place kind of answers your own question doesnt it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we used to call them a ramp on wheels
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes the spelling of osirus is key
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think hes trying to find out which movie or show they were used in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i found this an italian movie the osirus project might be related but cant find out anything about it much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for sticks of french bread or flowers the ones in my supermarket have a sticker saying that in the middle bit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for baguettes and flowers or any other elongated object really you flip it over so an object can pass through it and be held
whatisthisthing,not_removed,coles trolley melb australia the attachment lifts forward but seems too high to be for steadying bottles never seen one before thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you hook the handles of your reusable shopping bags over it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for flowers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a cup holder then ones i have are fully round and just hook over the cart edge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for baguettes and flowers or any other elongated object really you flip it over so an object can pass through it and be held
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it doesnt really flip over it lifts forward but you cant make it stay forward also i wouldve though you could just store that stuff in the sectioned off but at the end or on the kids seat at the front
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe seems a bit tall for the flowers they sell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks too big to even hold a big gulp cup
whatisthisthing,not_removed,even so this is the correct answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you know this how
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because the trolleys in a supermarket near me have these and theres a plastic attachment to them which illustrates flowers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where are you have they had them long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,uk its not a new thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im in australia never seen one before there was no other trolley like it in the rows either and im old ive been grocery shopping for decades

whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an antique telegraph box httpswwwgooglecomsearchqantiquetelegraphbox
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it would be helpful if we could see whats under the board all the components are affixed to the real work happens under there based on what i can see whatever it is was built before the and likely was hand made if its a radio that vertical cylinder has a single vacuum tube in it or just a socket where a tube could be placed the problem with that theory is that most tubes that old are wider and shaped like incandescent light bulbs radios from that time also ran usually on external batteries the three posts on the upper right hand side of the board imply that this is possible one would be positive one would be negative and third would be the ground which would also serve as the antenna the horizontal cylinder could be a tuning component known as a pot or variable potentiometer but it would be a weird one because they usually arent cylindrical and they usually arent enclosed i think the more likely answer is that this is a battery i dont know what any of the parts would be other than the terminals which would be two of those three posts the switch to their left might be an onoff and the knob on the outside might control current flow the vertical post would likely be a place for adding water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup it is an old faradic battery electrotherapy device

whatisthisthing,not_removed,wire on nail is the universal signal from the electrician to the drywall guys that this wire has to stick out of the wall only for low voltage of course everything else has to be in a box typically used for doorbells garage door openers indicator lights thermostats even telephone anything that wasnt and could be surfacemounted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its another door opener wire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ifs its a brown wire with a small bunch of smaller wires inside its a pre wire for a second garage door wrapping the wire around the nail is to let the drywall crew drywallers are not known for their intellect not to board over top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a prewiring for another garage door opener possibly is the garage doors or perhaps only garage door opener in a door garage and the other is there for additional installation check the roof of the garage in the same area where the current door opener is is there another wire there near an outlet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how many garage doors do you havewe sometimes wrap the wire around nail so it stays stick out of sheetrocksourceim a residential electrician
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be almost anything but at my old house there was something similar and it turned out to be an internet cable the house had been a business and they used the garage as another office i would say tv but that is clearly to narrow to be coaxial
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dear god im enjoying the homeowner answers here its not phone its not cable its a low voltage wire for another garage door opener thermostat doorbell or anything low voltage the nail is indeed so the sheetrockers know not to rock over it can confirm am hvac contractor and have done this for over years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its prewiring for either another garage door opener or a remote keypad the nail is just to keep the wire somewhat tidy instead of dangling and looking like a loose end which it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks everybody a lot of you nailed it see what i did thereanyhow i checked the other garage bay and sure enough there was a pigtail hanging down where another door opener would go thanks again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats for another garage lift
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it possible they wired the wires that go to the sensors all the way to where the garage door opener button goes instead of to the unit or even from the unit to the button instead of down each side of the garage door opening
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the phone lines when we moved into our house years old there was a nail in one of the basement beams with all of the phone lines wrapped around it and they all worked
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unwrap it from the nail and see if there are individual wires inside and what color they are if so check with a voltage tester first of course
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im betting its an antenna for the opener instead of having a wire dangle they wrapped it on the nail
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it might just be a nail with a wire to make it fatter for hanging stuff etc unwrap the wire and see if its actually attached to anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whys there a need for the nail why isnt leaving the cable itself enough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also the universal signal that your insulator is a lazy cunt and didnt do his job properly hello leaks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup i have a car garage but only the two car door has an opener the single car door has wires pre laid so when i decide to have it installed the wires are all ready ran for me my house is years old for what its worth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you have another one coming out of the ceiling by the second garage door the one that doesnt have an opener
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so is that screw supposed to be removed after op chooses to have an opener installed how is it removed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a good thought on some type of internet cable but i asked the previous owners and they said it was there when it was built they are the original owners and the house was built in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,coaxle coaxial or coax
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the garage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i doubt it the antenna is a short wire that hangs from the main unit it isnt usually near the switch and in fact changing the length of the antenna or its location is often a good way to reduce the performance of the radio even if you didnt want it to dangle from the main housing you can just tape it to the top of the unit or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because it can easily get tucked behind insulation or just ignored by the drywall guys often you run the wire and place it weeks or months before insulation and drywall go in drywallers are notorious for going really fast and burying things unless they stick out enough to be impossible to bury ive still seen speakers outlets lights and even fire extinguisher brackets buried by them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so do you just manually open it every time that sounds annoying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wish all houses had pre laid wire for garage doors i rarely ran across them maybe one in twenty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just pull the nail the opener gets screwed over top there should be a matching wire hanging from the ceiling as well as on either side of the garage door for the safety eye
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you want to trace it buy a tone set like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,then its probably just a regular electric cable for a light that was never installed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be for anything but if i were to bet money id say for security wiring lots of builders dont offer security systems but they will prewire the house for a security system for you and a common location for a panel is right inside your front door as well as right by the door from the garage to the house right where yours it ive got literally the same thing in my house that i had security prewiring done its not wrapped around a nail but its coiled just like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for now but we dont open it all that often this post tho has got me thinking about having one installed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the wire looks too small for volt my money is on phone or doorbell another possibility is that they ran a wire for a garage door opener either theres a second door that doesnt have one installed or it wasnt used for some other reason
whatisthisthing,not_removed,makes sense likely ran the wiring for the second opener and hooked it around the nail so the sheetrock and painters could do their thing and not bury the wire

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it may be a trap that was placed to prevent cankerworms from climbing and destroying the tree whats the location
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ask your schools arborist they will probably tell you everything about it the tree how they became an arborist and whatever else you ask them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if the surface is slightly tacky then these may be traps to help stop various insect pests from damaging the trees one form of it was basically a doublestick tape that you would commonly see in the because of a swelling of harmful gypsymoth populations
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre squirrel collars at least thats what we call them in illinois basically it prevents squirrels from climbing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,moth traps usually stop larvae climbing up to the tree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is your source a lonely arborist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right they are for stopping animals and maybe even insects from climbing trees ive never heard of anyone using them to keep squirrels out of their natural habitat but thats intriguing source i use these on my trees to keep my cats from climbing them one of my cats climbed a huge redwood in my front yard and it cost me to have a tree care company to get her down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,homeowner in charlotte here if you dont use these things on your trees the cankerworms will destroy every leaf in the area it is absolutely disgusting how many of them there are they drop from the branches on silk strings there are billions of them they also poop and it looks like black pepper there is so much of it you can actually hear it falling to the ground like a very light rain sprinkle these bands are basically an area to apply the sticky substance tanglefoot so the worms cant climb up the trees before the first frost
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yea these look like the same httpsuiunccedustorycharlottecankerwormaerialspraying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its less that they want to keep them from climbing trees and more that they want to keep the squirrels off roofs the collars prevent the squirrels from getting to roof level or at least thats the goal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wouldnt say i know for sure but a lot of important places government property universities etc prefer to not look like a haven for rodents even though the squirrels were probably there first
whatisthisthing,not_removed,generally the only way these deterrents work is if there are nearby but not too nearby trees that are not collared if every tree in the area had a collar like that then squirrels just learn how to jump past that if decently adjacent trees without collars are nearby then theyll just jump from one tree to the next
whatisthisthing,not_removed,squirrel collar that is not a squirrel collar

whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably if its that old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what would the powerout be for just a passthrough so you dont sacrifice a wall socket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as someone else mentioned they used the same housing for external cd drives which used to have audio jacks so you could play cds thru a stereo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doubt it drives have been around for ever
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes same as with old cpus and monitors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been into computers since the early and i dont think ive ever seen a power passthrough before never too old to learn i guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems like most old power supplies had pass through httpiimgurcomxqotcxjjpg then you could connect to monitor with this cable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they were common i like them because you only needed wall plug and the monitor powers off when you switch off the pc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe it was a mac thing i remember this for sure then your monitor would turn off with your computer was actually pretty sweet

whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes do not plug that into a powered outlet they made the unfortunate decision to use this plug style for professional studio strobe optical triggers i suspect they chose this plug style so any standard vac extension cord could be used read cheap but very unfortunate from a safety perspective

whatisthisthing,not_removed,what will happen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wish i had a better picture so i could sketch out a circuit i assume low power dc flows until it sees a flash of light and then opens the loop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre being a bit dramatic itll be a big flash and a bit of smoldering
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if anything youll test the circuit breaker or fuse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lucky
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its probably a camera flash trigger thing like other people have said but i know what youre talking about you can use a single neon bulb to httpwwwcliftonlaboratoriescomrelaxationoscillatorhtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive never tried it with mine but they are designed for low voltage only best case theyll just make a muffled popping noise and go black worst case the plastic case explodes probably too strong a word for this and sends out plastic shrapnel not very entertaining but hazardous given the small size of the plastic vs the size of the metal prongs plugging it into vac will be hard without also touching the metal and getting yourself shocked insert here the usual dangers of touching live ac lines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most likely nothing studio strobes old enough to use those plugs for triggering would often have a trigger voltage the same as or higher than the mains supply feeding it most predigital cameras used mechanical switches to trigger the flash so across the sync terminals wouldnt be a problem for the camera and adding a low voltage switching stage to the strobes trigger circuit would just introduce unnecessary costs and extra point of failure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can probably find an equivalent circuit online iirc the circuit is kept open until a pulse of light energizes a solar cell which closes the circuit momentarily
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can never be too dramatic when it comes to safety
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would easily arc such a small distance and fry the components

whatisthisthing,not_removed,maserati symbol upside down they make cars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look on my pic of the gold coin bottle opener the back of the box has a very similar design
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre good does seem to be some sort of spoof
whatisthisthing,not_removed,one never buys a second maserati
whatisthisthing,not_removed,finally got one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you dont buy maserati maserati buys you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are brackets for httpswwwgooglecomsearchqbracketcontinentalcurtainrod edit specifically
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this makes sense lots of large windows thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah those tongues sticking out would lock in place on some sort of vertical rail on the wall
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mark solved i came here excited because i actually knew this one thanks for bursting my bubble

whatisthisthing,not_removed,best bet right now is some sort of httpsenwikipediaorgwikianarchistsymbolism but i cant find this specific combination of brownblue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any chance they are acadian there is an acadian flag that i saw in nova scotia canada that is is similar people seemed to put them in front of houses near mailboxes etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,genuinely dont think its an anarchist flag they always have black and are usually red and black but may be other colours with black for different anarchist factions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have no idea i just drive by this house from time to time in a neighboring town

whatisthisthing,not_removed,the box isnt in the greatest of shape so theyve obviously been there for a few years the train tracks are still in use but there isnt a station or a train yard particularly close to this spot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks like the orange line max
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,post removed please use the stickied post for all further discussions about this item
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwwikihowcomtestsilver there is a hallmark its below the word sterling and above rsilverbugs might be quicker at an id or you can test at home with the link given above there are more hallmarks than british ones that uhijackthis linked
whatisthisthing,not_removed,apparently made by an american firm which did make sterling items so id say thats what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont see any hallmark so im going to say no it looks like its plated or brass is it a church collection plate by any chance take a look at this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can if you want but generally silverware companies were good at properly marking their items if its stamped sterling it is if it was plate itd have epns stamped on it or some other term like quadruple plate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im going to say brass then thats not magnetic either and the plate also has a golden tint to it just like brass sterling silver will always have hallmarks this one has a marking but that could have been the company name or even where it manufactured
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rwhatsthisplant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe its a rendition of very awesome statue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i never saw a japanese or eastern asian god like this i can recognize many japanese local gods and buddhas but this statue is so unique i wonder if it is a contemporary art piece thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved i never thought this question will be solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking this myself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes it reminded me yama for the first time i saw it thank you for replying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i do not speak japanese so im going off of google translate here but i believe it is a prop from a movie the statue appears in a so most likely a contemporary piece of work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so it looks like the link is to a blog called gekicine i looked it up and read the httpwwwgekicinejpenaboutus section and it looks like its a theatre gekistage has its own allure cinecinema has its own appeal a new entertainment that combined the two is geki x cine its japanese theatre made out to be just as exciting as movies basically the statue was made as a promotion for the theatre and its on display at a cafe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you guys are awesome thank you for the information also i need to go to that cinema if i have the chance to visit tokyo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what an interesting idea thanks for doing the extra research
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol me too i bookmarked the info in case im able to go one day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought so too no problem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say shoes keeps them from getting the rest of your clothes dirty eta heres something similar labeled as a shoe compartment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its about the size of a soccer ball so my first guess would be that wouldnt want your clothes to get dirty when your ball is muddy right other possibilities usedwet clothes shoes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i always use these for wet bags if im on the go
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this has long been a source of mystery in my family it looks like a hay stack of some sort but i cant find an image of anything matching it very closely the closest thing i can find is there isnt a manufacturers mark or country of manufacture anywhere on the puzzle my mom thinks she may have purchased it through ltd commodities roughly years ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the dutch one in the wiki hay barrak article is hexagonal so why not a fivesided one that would make your poles make sense heres another thought things for children usually are the quintessentialmostnormalversionof so where in the world are most normal cows brown and white and sheep black and barns have saltbox roofs and houses have arched windows
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be a pole shed with hay or straw inside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like taj mahal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre on to something here so the cow is either a guernsey or a milking shorthorn both of which originated in england and came to the us httpwwwdairyspotcomdairyfarmingdairyfarmingfactstypesofcows im going to eliminate the us as a possibility from the house description farmhouses here are simple never arhed windows grew up in nebraska ill keep looking at the other clues and edit as i find something edit this is without a doubt a dutch haystack google image search dutch haystack sided tent with a pyramid roof to keep the hay dry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh i much prefer the second answer drat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved the last photo in the wikipedia article bears a pretty striking resemblance to the puzzle piece now to figure out where this puzzle originated that children would be expected to identify a hay barrack ujapaneseknotweed made about some of the peculiarities of this puzzle black sheep guernsey cows saltbox barn roof that might be good leads
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly a pole fire screen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fire screen was my first thought
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope one of a pair of andirons google decorative brass andirons and youll find pairs nearly identical to ops
whatisthisthing,not_removed,makes sense thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the venting system for a glass factory ne glass plant rd
whatisthisthing,not_removed,specifically that is the owens illinois glass plant right there off of and the uprr also known in the industry and o and i
whatisthisthing,not_removed,go knock on the door and ask
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you i assumed it was some kind of ventilation for industrial use now that i know its for glass i wonder more specifically why the elaborate shape instead of a square building with the ventilation built after the fact it just seems weird thats for your answer though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks to your details im going to do some more research on the why for this funky ventilation design
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would but between me and this building are a myriad of highways and dead ends that would make it a difficult journey at best
whatisthisthing,not_removed,understood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a temperature probe i recently installed a heated tile floor and the temp sensors looked similar could refer to degrees fahrenheit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im surprised not more suggestions of blasting cap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it think its definitely a thermo couple or switch google came up with ones that look like it for a pitco fryer or something so not a detonator c thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was found lying in the desert sand next to some rusty machinery my grandpa owned a woodworking factory and acquired a lot of junk it was immediately next to some a very large halogen lamp and an industrial air heater or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a httpsenwikipediaorgwikitraverseboard used for dead reckoning navigation at sea the board allows you to record course and speed that was traveled over a certain amount of time usually one watch that in turn gives you a rough idea of distance traveled and location it was important to keep record of your location between astronomical sightings which were taken at noon each day the observations were generally more accurate than dead reckoning depending on the skill of the person taking the observations and completing the navigational calculations however deadreckoning was still important when weather prevented the noon observation or if you were sailing in an area with navigational hazards like shoals or reefs the top part is used to record the heading and would often have a compass rose painted on it this one doesnt the bottom section records the speed in knots two pegs are inserted each half hour one turn of a ships hour glass one for the heading one for the speed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cribbage board maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,found in nova scotia canada cant tell you much else about it anybody know what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how big is it are there holes for the pegs to fit into where we have a weird thing something like this that is a httpwwwgalleriagregcomblogomaticstretcher im wondering if this is some kind of jig that makes crocheting easier
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just forwarded it to a friend of mine who is passionate and knowledgeable about all things yarnish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats definitely it and this is a maritime region thank you so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like various sea creatures that are obliterated with digital effects
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can tell you that the last two have parts of navigational charts overlaid on the pictures soundings in fa is soundings in fathoms meaning that the chart has measurements of the water depth soundings and the depth is measured in units of fathoms one fathom is six feet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you by any chance know what some of these creatures are apart from the coral one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,omg you are amazing iv been trying to figure out what on earth those where thank you so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like sea squirts tube sponge anemone starfish urchins etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a siren often used in cities or towns to warn residents of pending natural disasters such as a tsunami
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the space between the saucers is actually the horn with one or more electrodynamic transducer motors pointing up or down into the gap a common design for by stacking several of these in a httpsenwikipediaorgwikilinearray it maximizes the horizontal directivity and minimizes the vertical directivity so sound isnt wasted up into the sky and it can be audible for many km without blasting out the people right under it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and the obligatory httpsyoutubecuvjjwblne showing the construction of said siren
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its matucana madisoniorum i think its also adorable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpswwwetsycomsearchqbulbasaurplanter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rsucculents if you dont have success here they are amazing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also try rwhatsthisplant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,she needs httpsucculentmonsterscom for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like genus matucana
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikipeyotemediafilelophophorawilliamsiiiesjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like peyote to me source have peyote
whatisthisthing,not_removed,peyote
whatisthisthing,not_removed,matucana madisoniorum if they cant find one lophophora are common too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have her check out the sidebar in rcactus for information about what kind of soil to make for it and how to care for it during winter basically it needs highmineral contentlow organic content soil and to be kept cool down to near freezing and very very dry in the winter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also check rsucculents
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you like cactus try finding a which is a really cool mutant cactus they ship really well and can be found on amazon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,then you surely know this is not peyote peyote does not ever have spines you can send me a picture of your plant but you can also google that shit and figure out what you have many look alikes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not an imposter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sometimes we see what we wanna see i guess d
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont see spines my peyote is var caespitosa like here httpwwwmagicactuscomlwcaespitosahtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,only lophophora williamsii but i dont assume theyre going to eat it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,l diffusa l fricii are probably the ornamental ones youll find lophophora williamsii is the peyote one technically illegal unless youre a native person but i dont think theres anyone running around enforcing that and theyre pretty scarce
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can buy san pedro online and sometimes in stores which has mescaline
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the cactus is explicitly legal in canada only becomes illegal if you cut it and dry it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doubt it on the endangered list
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is peculiar one of my favorite geckos is lygodactylus williamsi is there a relation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,williamsii never has spines not peyote
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mescaline
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not this one not loprophora williamsii
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can also grow them but they take awhile to produce the necessary buttons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually you do need a special type of licensepermit to harvest them in texas not just anyone of the navajo tribe can drive over and pluck them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lol ok that makes a lot more sense thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is that pronounced william see eye like radii rade ee eye
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how can you differentiate between the three species i have lophophora growing they are definitely lophophora in a bowl of mixed cacti that i got from my parents they are about the diameter of a £ coin one of them has tufts coming off where the spines would be two of them occasionally have pink flowers one of them doesnt flower at all i dont know if those are diagnostic features or not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can find it in deserts too but its super illegal to take them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and peruvian torch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was the case in the uk as well but god knows now what with the new everything is illegal unless we say it isnt law
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably both named after the the guy that discoverednamedcatalogued them a williams or william
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no relation i cant figure out which williams lemaire named the lophophora after but the lygodactylus is named after ernest edward williams an american herpetologist born years after lemaires death so they are unlikely to be the same person
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a very long time to produce to years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you get arrested for possession like say someone grows one and then say he thought it was just a cactus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually you do need a special type of licensepermit to harvest them in texas not just anyone of the navajo tribe can drive over and pluck them it is also very bad to harvest them at all from the wild they are due to this there is zero reason to use lophs for mescaline they take forever to grow and san pedro can replace them of the time only those that farm them should be using them in any way and they usually graft them onto other cactii for faster growth taking them from the wild is very uncool you can buy san pedro at home depot folks should just use that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes ii in species names is pronounced ee eye sometimes names only take a single a single i and the pronunciation changes accordingly this is the genitive form of the name so williamsii means of william radii is nominative plural but has the same suffix unlike many species names which are adjectives gender must match that of the named person not the genus name say rosa laevigata is not laevigatus but rosa henryi is fine because augustine henry was a guy and rosa banksiae is feminine because it isnt named after the botanist joseph banks but his wife
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the describing taxonomist is not allowed to name it after themselves it is sometimes named after the original collector who is almost never the person who describes it as a species or after a respected authority in the field often the taxonomists mentor or something like that sometimes they cheat theres an obnoxious australian snake taxonomist that his given a number of taxa his name claiming that they are named after his wife or dog both excuses have been used more than once rather than himself i cant figure out which williams lemaire named the lophophora after but the lygodactylus is named after ernest edward williams and american herpetologist born years after lemaires death so they are unlikely to be related
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heh my dad brought one tiny peyote back to europe from peru in the and has been obsessed with growing it he has pretty big clusters of peyotes now and is constantly separating a few to start new ones back then in peru here was given a thin slices of peyote by the indigenous people to put on the tongue to deal with mountain thickness he had to vomit pretty violently but was fine after i think he was tripping a bit though im quite sure he hasnt used it since though he just likes to grow difficult plants
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it can be done in from seed using anne haloniums hydroponic grafting method the stock is pereskiopsis a waterloving cactus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its most likely that they wont know wtf it actually is unless youre really giving off other visual cues that they ought to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id guess theyd ask where you got it from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you have a bag of dried buttons absolutely if its growing on your patio with a bunch of other cactus its pretty unlikely there are lots of growers worldwide
whatisthisthing,not_removed,care to elaborate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,generally they give coca leaf for mountain sickness it must sit under the tongue and sometimes its better with a tiny bit of lime stone i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the nursery where do you get your plants
whatisthisthing,not_removed,care to elaborate on what the peyote cactus is endangered in the wild from people harvesting it they take decades to grow into tiny little buds the san pedro cactus or httpsenwikipediaorgwikiechinopsispachanoi is a common cactus which im sure youve seen many times it is sold everywhere and is also very high in mescaline content mescaline is the active ingredient in peyote it is the reason people harvest wild lophs peyote so you can just use san pedro if mescaline is your end goal it grows much faster is widely available and is nowhere near endangered mescaline is a psychoactive compound it is a hallucinogen with a long history of use
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a httpsenwikipediaorgwikisundogs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,parhelion also called sun dogs atopticscoukhaloparheliahtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,indeed it is also see ratoptics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably burning phosphorus or magnesium could be from one of the weapons or from the countermeasures flares
whatisthisthing,not_removed,different materials emit different color flames when they burn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed and probably flares
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it crashed in hostile territory its also possible that they intentionally destroyed any equipment that would have survived to keep it from being recovered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed you can barely even see the flames directly but that white sheen in the center is something burning very hot burning magnesium is almost like a welding glare even in broad daylight the orange flames are likely fuel oil andor just burning plastics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry that i didnt mark it sooner i tried via mobile but i guess the post didnt go through
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,next op will find the rest of the belt then the pants then the body
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heres a blurry picture of the backside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure this is related but an eagle eating a snake is part of the coat of arms of mexico and comes from an aztec legend httpsenwikipediaorgwikicoatofarmsofmexico
whatisthisthing,not_removed,holy shit that was quick i guess thats solved now thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seeing the back of it i wouldnt be so quick to say it is a belt buckle to me it looks more like just some type of decorative item
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the ends look like but a rigid rod is not usually how they connect it could be an electrical connection
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a connector for a low voltage rail lamp system ill look for a link and edit edit something like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i figured it out its the core to a small spring scale my son took apart
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the grooved parts on either end can rotate but do not do so readily no other parts are movable found on my walkway in california
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an axle for a toymodel car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had the same thought with the end piecesthey definitely look like they are designed to connect into a socket but im not convinced its anything electrical theres no insulation its probably stainless steel it just seems it would be too dangerous and impractical for an electrical connection
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe im having a hard time finding anything like that that matches very well i think its way too short for that but its a possibility i guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know i think its stainless steel nonmagnetic and looks like its too well made for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these things have connectors in between the rails like long my parents have a lamp with pretty much the same piece the rails are hollow and you can connect them via banana plug there are also connectors which have a hinge in the middle bend and bothto make a circle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a temperature sensor for an indooroutdoor thermometer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does the top screw off it could be a tiny geocache
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this very likely called a remote bulb that on the other end would be a thermostat controller ones ive installed are used for boilers outside air get warmer shuts off the boiler but may have application for ac systems op yours sounds like it was disconnected if cannot trace it back inside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exactly that they had a remote bulb that was mounted outdoors with a little metal strap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my grandmother had just like it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good that means i can rip it off thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my mom has a thermometer that tells her the temp both inside and outside you mount it near a window and use the bulb for the outdoor temperature no need for it to be particularly accurate its more for novelty or a general sense of the temperature than for controlling hvac equipment somebody probably had one of those and it broke or was just ripped out and tossed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hopefully exact been caught with my knickers down in not being exact before haha only thing is is ive not seen a remote bulb exactly like this we used honeywell brand that were longer thinner so ill go sure too theres no sun shield so this remote in the pic is taking its own radiant temp not the surrounding air temp but thats just a goofup on whoever attached to the wall
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this bulb seems to match
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it is a for a door latch im not finding a similar example online but my surmise is that this is a half spindle for holding a rotating knob onto a door latch mechanism the three grooves are for to hold the shaft in the door lock or httpwwwgaragedoorstuffcomproductgaragedoorlockinsidereleasehandle and the indentations are for the set screws that would hold various types of knobs to the spindle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it the same on all sides
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gun rack i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a gun rack a gun rack i dont even own a gun let alone many guns that would necessitate an entire rack what am i going to do with a gun rack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an old gold or silver gold plated cigarette case there are initials on either side of that bird that are rubbed down pretty bad so you cant see in the picture im pretty sure its j bird c or j bird g says made in france then underneath a smeared with more smaller indecipherable numbersletters then the shield with a hammer crossed with what looks like a dragon myself and other people have spent hours searching for what any of these symbols mean other than the made in france lol i cant even figure out what the stamp means im usually really good at finding this stuff but need your help with this one thanks in advance for any info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so looking at her post history it looks like she posted more info but its not showing up here for some reason its an old gold or silver gold plated cigarette case there are initials on either side of that bird that are rubbed down pretty bad so you cant see in the picture im pretty sure its j bird c or j bird g says made in france then underneath a smeared with more smaller indecipherable numbersletters then the shield with a hammer crossed with what looks like a dragon myself and other people have spent hours searching for what any of these symbols mean other than the made in france lol i cant even figure out what the stamp means im usually really good at finding this stuff but need your help with this one thanks in advance for any info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah that was weird automod deleted op and your comment ill try to figure out why they should be visible now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,optional break which i found by googling ms word markup symbols
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you i googled and couldnt find it

whatisthisthing,not_removed,centipede
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it is an ethmostigmus trigonopodus commonly known as blue ring centipede i kept one as a pet for awhile and theyre wicked little critters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,house centipede nbd
whatisthisthing,not_removed,knew a woman that got but by one in hawaii super nasty little things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is not a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiscutigeracoleoptrata unless you mean that it is a centipede that was found in a house
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seriously this could not look less like a house centipede
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right and i learned something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it looks like a regular centipede to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is for the lego robot nxt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a lego mindstorms sound sensor the port in the back is connected to the main controller using a cable weve them on our programming club
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsimgurcomawqchl another photo it looks like it was connected to something via wire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the correct answer the most useless of sensors source coached first lego league teams for the past years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you kind stranger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also a former fll coach agree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not completely useless it can be used as a pretty imprecise collision detector but yeah most useless of the nxt sensors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hah less useless than i thought
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just asked one of our more robotics minded electricians and he also suggested that it could be used to detect the density of materials neither of us could think up why anyone practical reason one would want to do that but hey since when has robot building ever has been about practical reasons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not useless it can be a keychain said before it gets lost in the bus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks kind of like a linoleum carving knife for making linoleum art kind of like a woodcut we carved these squares of linoleum and used a roller to cover it with ink dye or paint then pressed paper on it to make a print this was in art class in the mideighties with a very oldschool teacher im probably wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a gouge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where did you get it ive seen several massive replicas of normal sized fountain pens made for advertising purposes it could be that this is an old version of that probably from the or at the latest are there any sort of manufacturer marks on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe it is a tool for making batik or something similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the tip of it appears to have been hot at some point it is a different on some parts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a tool for woodworking on a lathe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe for carving wax its just huge is the thing but after googling brass wax tools there are similar looking smaller versions just a thought
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure its a lino cutting tool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you open the back of this tool if so maybe its purpose is similar to the tip is heated and you can run pvc string through it to seal corners of linoleum sheet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just throwing this out there it looks similar to a cup used to test coffee in a roaster maybe its something similar a device that you pop into a roasterfurnace and use it to take a small sample i only suggest that because in another post you mentioned that the tip looked like it had been heated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a fountain pen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perhaps pottery tool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thought it might be a veterinary fleam but material and size might disqualify httpimgurcomodsrpbj
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be a tool for sharpening hole punch drill bits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like either a old style pen with portable ink well or a carving engravergouger used for wood or perhaps plasticlinoleoum
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this also looks like a massive dip pen it doesnt look like it has tines for the ink either im confused about the hole at the tip and what looks like tines in another picture but might only be a groove
whatisthisthing,not_removed,idk my first thought was something in which to collect samples with and keep safe possible radioactive sample could be lined with lead and easily stored in tube like containers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a fountain pen that lost the plasticky part under the nib
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an oversized display piece fountain pen may have had a decorative nib which fitted over the plain base nib perhaps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,antique ballpoint pen with broken nib
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a gouge possibly for a lathe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a dip pot fountain pen the tip of the nib is broken but the telltale hole in the nib is there there will be a very fine line from the hole in the nib to the tip when you dip the pen in the inkpot a small droplet of ink is left in the small hole as you write the ink flows true the fine channel from the hole to the paper leaving a mark apologies for typos shitty phone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some kind of gouging tool indeed seems too big to be a lino carver though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we still used these in my high school when i graduated in so they live on in at least one high school
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing except for leather i use to play with these all the time to curve bracelets edges
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i work in a second hand store we found it in the bottom of a toolbox there are no markings on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a oversized model of a fountain pen probably a display piece or a creative machinist made it as a hobby project the nib is crude compared to rest of it but you can clearly see in the third pic that the tip is blunted and it has a breather hole about halfway down but no slit or feed it appears from the second pic that the cap used to have a clip resting against it which has since been lost
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is exactly what was thinking i posted above glad im not the only one seeing it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a giant inkwell pen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,too flimsy for that lathe tools are heavy duty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the back does not open the tip does come out with a bit of force however
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its over a foot long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the feed is missing and theres no slit on the top along with it being too thick but it could be some kind of display
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking a clay sculpting or pottery tool too not the exact thing but a couple of them look similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is my vote my grandmother had lots of things like these when working with ceramics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i kinda thought this too maybe even ceremonial
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was my first thought too however look at the ruler in the first picture its over foot long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this gets my vote and it has a rough surface so that you can hold onto it while carving but why does it close to protect the point and blade
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this gets my vote and it has a rough surface so that you can hold onto it while carving but why does it close to protect the point and blade
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a dip pot fountain pen that is over a foot long it must be a pen for giants
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also the tip is brass which is soft and wont hold a sharp edge definitely not a linocut tool i think its some sort of tool for taking samples maybe soil i wonder if the tube inside pulls out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seeing as you found it in a toolbox my money is on woodworking or block printing tool like but perhaps for large wood carving given its size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely definitely hahaha unlikely
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a long fountain pen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an aqueduct pen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oops thanks totally thought those were centemeters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,body looks like brass tip looks like copper id guess it is a gouging tool for what i dont know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely lol yeah its definitely a heavyduty dirt spoon p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,giant novelty fountain pen gold antique with cap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are centimetres of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,copper is softer yet i am almost certain it is a powder or grain sampler or similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rtranslator

whatisthisthing,not_removed,you cut off my weiner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nosecone for a model rocket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this was going to be my guess the square loop at the top is where the parachute would be tied
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly though i just did a search and all of the cones i saw images of were tapered at the base to fit in the tube airframe it was found in a wooded area near a fairly large park with a big open field in these woods i have found bikes airsoft pellets and targets soccer balls lacrosse balls and other assorted sports and hobby items so it is a very real possibility
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,typically the white part would be a smaller diameter than the blue part and a parachute would be tied to the hook the rocket engine blows out the back way pushing the rocket into the air then burns internally a bit and then burns up pushing the nosecone and parachute out of the top of the rocket there is a sad child somewhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you do model rocketry do any cones exist that dont have the taper to fit in the airframe tube in every other way it looks like a rocket nose cone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there white part is smaller
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i do and this is a model rocket nose cone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sold them for years wasnt a detail i really paid attention to honestly check that link i posted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,literally hundreds look like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good enough for me thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no youre wrong they need to have a slightly smaller diameter and yours does in fact have that thats all it needs that tiny step is all it is its a rocket nose cone and it is identical to hundreds of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a power supply that converts to since it has a terminal block instead of a connector its probably a general purpose unit it can be used for any application that needs those specs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,like led lights
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most likely low voltage httpsenwikipediaorgwikihalogenlamp those were common before leds became popularaffordable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,leds are almost always run on dc not ac
whatisthisthing,not_removed,plus would let you run enough leds to illuminate most of the neighbourhood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you havent seen my christmas lights
whatisthisthing,not_removed,edit 蓬盛 pengsheng is the brand 香港橄榄菜 hongkong style olive dish may be a better translation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually 菜 is more veggie here than dish because the majority of it is mustard greens as a child i used to think that olives were just these bare pits that somehow grew leaves since ive never had olives other than in these fermented veggies my parents never understood my confusion when i asked them about these black rubbery rings on a pizza and they told me they were olives
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont forget to mark as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so how did you eat this stuff as a sauce or garnish what kind of dishes or recipes are there for this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how do i do that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty much like you would pickles to put it in an asian perspective would be with plain rice or congee there should be some recipes either to make these or make dishes out of these but i personally have never tried any
whatisthisthing,not_removed,post solved as a comment less quotes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so this candle was originally pretty tall not that thick though the weird shape formed over a longer period of time probably by the melted wax dripping down at the side of the candle but why was that particular shape created
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had a candle with a wax basge attached to thr side once and it did very similar looks like a leaf or fern from something the peeled off when the candle melted down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably dripped on one side and when you burned the candle down it broke off the candle and got a little warm so it bended serveral drips made the pattern
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if youre meaning a bicycle with a petrol engine then is right if youre meaning that style of bike without the engine its a sometimes known as a beach cruiser
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a new whizzer style bicycle kit on a cruiser frame bike the original company was whizzer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a schwinn motorcycle or an urban cruiser with motor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you try whistling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,paint scraper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a hardwood floor scraper similar to this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess iron pellet httpsenmwikipediaorgwikipelletizing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i should add that it is magnetic its also very dense edit of course i have a grammar error in my title i meant inot of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this could be a meteorite edit where do you live you could take it to a nearby university if it turns out to be a meteorite it could be worth a lot of money resist the urge to donate it because they will try to get you to do so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think you could be right but its bigger than so it would have to be a large one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it has none of the characteristics of a meteorite other than having iron content and even if it were a meteorite it wouldnt be worth very much at most a few dollars for a nife httpmeteoriteswustledumeteorwrongsmeteorwrongshtm edit looks like a weather sideritehematite nodule
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know a lot about about meteorite but arent they usually not magnetic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youre right it might be hematite nodule
whatisthisthing,not_removed,many meteorites are high in iron
whatisthisthing,not_removed,arent they usually not magnetic no most are attracted to magnetseven the stony ones the exception being lunar or martian samples
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an i have a bunch in my office you can connect them to the back of your cable box to help hide them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,right i think i might know this the black box bit looks like a power input for a guitar pedal such as but some pedals use a jack type power input such as the ehx small clone httpwwwpulseonlinecomehsmallclonebackjpg so i think it could well be a fancy version of this adapter so that the common boss type of power supply unitspowerbanks can power the odder powered small clone type pedals just a theory though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,get a closeup of the port on the boxy bit else these guesses are going to be all over the place
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would assume it means i love turkey
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id have thought that in light of the recent airport attacks its probably a message of solidarity with istanbul
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay cool thats what i thought thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,juvenile bass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from your description i was going to say a fathead minnow or maybe a pirate perch but inches is way too long for either of those here is a for you to look at and see if you can find it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was it like this httpfishandboatcompafishspotbasmjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your drawings resemble a httpsenwikipediaorgwikismallmouthbass or maybe a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiyellowperch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure i looked up a juvenile bass and the ones that came up all had stripes only a few out of fifty maybe three or so had stripes they were all inches long to give further details the creek was feet wide and feet deep
whatisthisthing,not_removed,near charlotte the water in a small creek would be too warm for smallmouth to survive they could have been httpsenwikipediaorgwikigreensunfish which are common in southern creeks although would be in the upper reaches of their size is record size for a green sunfish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,largemouth bass usually have one stripe i assumed you meant the larger ones had the stripeits impossible without pics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know this is part of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiheartsutra written in chinese middle line reads top to bottom 是諸法空相，不生不滅 source i read chinese and used to be buddhist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you posted this same pic a few hours ago with such a small portion of the item showing it will be difficult to identify
whatisthisthing,not_removed,great work it doesnt help that random excerpts of the heart sutra sound like nonsense haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they do to be honest when i was young and they told me to memorize the whole thing i still remember till today even though i dont now what half of it means lol also mark as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think op has fallen into the toilet or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a slit in the little rats mouth so if that is indeed a slit and it is hollow it could be a piggy bank as early piggy bank models way long ago had to be actually broken this could be a replica
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats pest feces looks like maybe cockroach spider perhaps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bat poop perhaps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it looks like termite frass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you have mice or rats i would assume this is their dung
whatisthisthing,not_removed,carerpillar poop looks similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,telephone or cable tv splice point to break out the larger distribution cables to individual distribution links to individual houses or to splice two sections of cabling together ref
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a cable tv distribution box it is more likely that someone ran a tv cable to the box
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to answer your other half of the question the extension cord you see is actually a temp line going to a house waiting for it to be buried
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that appears to be a landline phone pedestal theyre where the buried trunk daylights so that the service lines may be connected
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or someone stealing cable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like some type of the wheels look like they came from a farm implement so it may be a recent fabrication for decoration

whatisthisthing,not_removed,platter from on a disk pack for a cdc httpsenmwikipediaorgwikistoragemoduledevice a platter pack held i used to maintain them the drives were about as big as a washing machine they had their own climate controlled room edit it could be from an ibm drive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,platter from an old hard disk appears to be damaged
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep old mainframe disk platter they were stacked on a spindle deep as a disk pack and youd have a whopping of hd space we used to make goingaway plaques out of them back in the day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your aunt is correct this is part of an old dishwashersize hard drive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a disk drive platter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like others have correctly pointed out that this is a computer disk drive platter heres one for sale online fiftyeight bucks isnt bad i wonder how much i could get for this damaged one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,identity disk from tron i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shit that was supposed to go on voyager
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is a scene from slc punk that reminded me of this although different disc use
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive got one hanging in my garage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was like whoa thats one of those huge hard drive things clicks it only like hours late
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whoa man years thats like ancient its probably older than that i was in the dec world the peak years for and thats mb and mb respectively were the late and early ide was already common years ago i got my first cd burner in my first dds tape drive in those big platters were one generation earlier
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i saw this recognized the disk figured id look through the comments to see other old it folks geezing about the past yes i have old punch cards and a tape writeprotect ring on a shelf by my desk i remember when my firm had both windows and warp as pcs were just entering the workplace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how wide is it it reminds me more of the inside of an old floppy disk they were commonly used with ibm mainframes and to boot the muxes that the mainframe terminals were connected to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a lamp shade from that photo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you want to take a gamble i could in theory dump the data with a heavily modified floppy drive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn thats crazy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep they had some in an old computer when i was in the air force they were scrapping it and my friend took one of the platters as a keepsake when he got transferred to a different base he gave it to me and i took to wearing it as a hat i was super professional when i was in the military i later learned i was in good company httpsstallmanorgsaintignuciusjpg it also made this really pleasant gong sound if you held it by the inside ring and tapped it im not sure what happened to it i think i left it in the care of some other bored airman when i got out its probably still out there passed down from generation to generation or it wound up in the garbage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,edit it could be from an ibm drive it could be from nearly anything from back then i worked as a field tech for dec back in the day and worked on lots of different dec branded drives and all of the big drives were multi platter disk packs the dec had platters and heads with an amazing capacity of for example
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we once had an ibm drive and at least the platter color and exterior diameter look identical dont remember what size the hole was
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i used to maintain a data point system that used similar big massive things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont forget the rest of the bunch burroughsunivacncrcdchoneywell or rca or memorex or some more i cant remember
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i took programming classes in on a burroughs and the hard drive was something like this i seem to recall it held so it was likely some species of this critter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i thought the mpi magnetic peripherals inc cdcs drive mfg offshoot now a part of seagate drives had bigass holes for bolts to go through the whole pack and their spacers i remember we turned one platter into one of those floor lamps with the little shelf at chari height for drinks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my dad had some of these when i was a kid he worked for ncr i think i remember him saying that a whole stack of those was kilobytes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think of this every time i see that picture of the guy holding a camera with a tape player vcr etc etc and it says your smart phone has replaced this that picture ignores how much memory your phone has and how big gigs would be in the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,came here to say hard disk platter and heres someone who can tell you what drive it came from and how much it stored
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah looking up a few things i think your right when you say its from an ibn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,check out youtube for a vid on the ibm ramac systems thats what this item reminded me of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they greatly resembled top load washing machines lid on top lifted just like a washing machine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my neighbors and i took apart one of those cdc units when we were kids i remember a platter exactly like this hanging on my friends wall for years decorated like a japanese gong we started building a wheeled robot using the bare frame of the drive but never had motors big enough to be practical
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these fly incredibly just wear a helmet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nice have some gold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a lot of gigs megs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i worked with similar drives from fujitsu in the late for some reason they had a little window where you could actually see the disks spin one day we got info one of our systems was down when we checked in the server room we heard a loud screeching noise from the fujitsu cabinet when we checked we saw that the readwrite head of one of the disks malfunctioned and was polishing the disk slowly the window filled with magnetic dust we had a backup but fujitsu disks were quickly replaced with dec disks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aunt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i remember our police dept got a brand new huge dishwasher size computer to finally put their reports on it had one of these discs in it i was a reporter and the receptionist gave me a tour of it she was talking about how it held megabytes of information and would hold thousands of reports she was so proud
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most server rooms have their own climate control these days
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i remember when my dad helped his company get a computer in the mid thing had its own room w ac looked like a large printing press
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i walk by a complete one almost every day thats in a display case i recognized it immediately
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup ive got a couple of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you like a hundred years old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes a vintage mainframe hard disk probably cost many thousands new
whatisthisthing,not_removed,even older ones had just the ibm had a dedicated pack that you had to mount just to run the macro assembler autocoder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ibm are exactly what we used to have cant imagine itd be worth muchits just a piece of aluminum after all a fullyfunctional drive cabinet on the other hand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if then me knew what now me knows id have a whole lot of platters i could sell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,only right reply in the lot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,considering professional server rooms are mostly climate controlled it isnt so much different nowadays
whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha i used to wear mine as a halo too then i made it into an art piece on the transitory nature of memory total bs by adding the inside of a floppy disk and a disk with some old paper tape code and cards thrown in on my wall at the moment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,back in the late we had maybe or multidisk packs when i ran a usaf flight simulator we eventually upgraded the simulator to the smaller disk drives we are all familiar with and had to destroy the big disk packs we had because they contained sensitive information most bases spent weeks disassembling the multidisk packs and hand sanding the magnetic oxide off the individual disks before beating them with a sledgehammer into an aluminum mess before throwing it all in the dumpster we were smarter we disassembled all our disk packs threw the disks into a kiddy swimming pool poured in some muratic acid and all of the magnetic oxide coating just floated right off the disks we ended up with pounds and pounds of pristine aluminum and stainless steel which we sold for top dollar at the nearby recycling center because it needed no processing on their part our payment funded most of our sections christmas party that year
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that platter got around more than the bottle in the gods must be crazy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my old boss had something similar that had been hardsectored into sectors you could see the grooves cut in at the center of the disk he put a clock movement on it and hung it on his wall best clock in the building
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i hope that drive had no classified data on it no seriously ive worked on sites nonus that handled classified data there was a reason we incinerated old drives
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and they took the better part of an hour or more to copy all the data from one to another for backups i used to be an operator on the night shift did it every night
whatisthisthing,not_removed,winchester
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my dad brought some home when i was a kid he worked for ncr this would have been in the late seventies early eighties probably most of his would have come from grocery stores or banks

whatisthisthing,not_removed,where at ncr my grandpa worked at sugar camp we spent the summers at ncr swimming pool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ncr is real
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont see how it could happen the walls of the drive had layers of heavy gauge steel we had some head crashes which werent discovered until the brown oxide was scraped off the platters the inside of the drive was covered in dust it had to be completely disassembled be scrupulously cleaned have new heads installed extensively tested on a scratch pack before loading the expensive ce alignment pack and being calibrated to it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you round to the nearest hundred yes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you like five years old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ouch my father worked in computer operations in a bank in and a few years before they were still doing everything on reeltoreel data tapes i remember watching them as a young child this disks were probably from that same era or a few years later funny how computers are so ubiquitous now that they were nonexistent in the lifetimes of a lot of people still living today more amazing is someone actually years old they can probably tell you when they got electricity first saw a car first saw an airplane first rode in a car first heard a radio first saw a tv the people who are years old now are the people who put men on the moon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i read this with a voice of someone who like only talks in questions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct answer but damaged how i see a lamp reflecting and youre obviously not going to get much data off one of these but wheres the damage just curious
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was ops grandma named grace hopper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,stahp just sthap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,only slightly more storage and computing power and bandwidth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats true but our computers were not in a climate controlled room the room was for disk drives only and had special air filtering to reduce dust thats because the drives had removable disk packs and dust could cause a head crash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,true but theyre cooled for the processing units not the storage units
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree reddit deserves this homage du memory
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah it was an unclassified system it mostly contained data for old weather observations if i had to guess i suppose the data might have technically been fouo for official use only but keeping it at my desk and wearing it as a hat is probably safe enough for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that gouge from the what looks like the platter being forced backwards against the head makes me cringe

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i used to sell mobile phones i once had a customer in his who grew up in a cabin with a dirt floor and no electricity he came in to buy a mobile hotspot for his laptop really admired that guy for keeping up with the times
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree that damage is not apparent data recovery is impossible even for the most advanced labs because the data was stored in parallel on or platters one of the problems with the design is that interchangeability of disk packs required periodic alignment checks against a reference disk pack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,even removing the platter from its original casing damages it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh that is a lamp it looked like a shoeprint on my phone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hint someone touched it skin oils deaaaaaath
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the tubes got wider
whatisthisthing,not_removed,still blows my mind that our current best graphics card gtx has more tflops processing power than the best supercomputer in the year ibm ascii white that weighed tons edit just checked and the ibm used the amount of electricity as the gtx vs good grief and since the is pounds the ibm weighed as much the progress in technology is truly astounding in scale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im now having flashbacks to that time in grad school when i heard a grinding sound coming from my hard drive reaches for whisky
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that does but it sitting out in open air without its cover to collect dust doesnt i highly doubt anyone cares about the data on those platters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he was a servicerepair man started there when he came back from air force late worked on cash registers in small grocery stores the old brass and steel ones trained up moved to atms proof machines bank equipment did maintenance and installs for banks grocery stores not just cash registers thats probably where he got the platters similar to op the computers that he was working on were for inventory thats why they needed more memory i think he said the first ones he installed were from a seed company or a grain elevator not sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was john pattersons way of keeping employees happy lasted beyond his death cafeterias entertainment family events etc it was a big idea at the time

whatisthisthing,not_removed,he was making a joke relax man
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you cant tell a joke its cancer of the meme you have hours to live
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its called a balance hole httpswwwbowlingthismonthcombowlingtipsbowlingballbalanceholefundamentals
whatisthisthing,not_removed,drilled for balance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exactly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the grateful dead wow it sure took a long time for them to stop being an instantly recognizable brand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well im embarrassed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a misericorde used for killing seriously injured knights during the middle ages im not sure if it authentic or not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i apologize for the bad picture but this pointy object has been in my grandfathers possession for a long time the story is that he picked it out of a junk pile at a flea market is it trash or treasure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youll need to give us a sense of scale it could easily be a letter opener for all we know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does the back of the sword look like it has or had a pin fitting or like if something has broken off if so its a kilt pin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think mctrustry was right on this dagger has blood grooves that run almost the full length of the blade if you google misericorde there are quite a few pictures and some show blood grooves
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely not trash the only question is how old is it i could be a real one from four or five hundred years ago or a repro from the or more recent tell us how long it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive added more pics in the comments please take a look its also inches long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont see any evidence of a pin fitting ive added more pictures in the comments if you wouldnt mind taking a look
whatisthisthing,not_removed,inches long ive got more pictures also ill post them later tonight
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was trying to imagine it as a fourburner camp stove but it doesnt look well suited for propane or wood burning maybe some kind of spinning pyrotechnic equipment for the festival edit wait was this a gardening festival not a music festival its probably just a planter great big flower pot in the middle smaller pots accenting it around the perimeter that would explain the decorative curve of the pipes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,table with chairs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can get an idea of scale in the second photo the drums are elliptical not perfectly round they were almost certainly placed here in a festival in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gardening was a big part of the festival that could be it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep i would say the same picnic table structure without the top surface and the chairs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its too small look at the leg to the side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreed seems too small for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a rock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the rock is polished in a tumbler it could be dyed quartz but the color could also be rhodonite
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a polished and dyed piece of agate a form of quartz
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a polished rock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it shouldnt matter what nationality the rock is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a black and pink polished rock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tumbled dyed quartz
whatisthisthing,not_removed,appears to be the inside part a fiber termination box that thin line you see painted likely runs to a spot in the house where you would typically have an optical network terminal ont do you have fiber internet in your area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they have normal smoke detectors so i dont think thats what this is any ideas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doorbell is that a wire coming out of the bottom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does your home have an alarm system that wire is pretty tiny but it does look a bit like an ultrasonic glass break detector for an alarm system does it light up if you tap a pencilpen on the wall near it if you can reach it the outer cover should pull right off and seeing the inside will tell us exactly what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it isnt a fiber box and the wire is instead made of metal it may be a thermostat for the temperature dial valve on the nearby heating radiator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i do have a fiber jack box on the other wall that must be what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres no doorbell at the door and the wire goes into the wall eventually
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is an ofs invisilight fibre module its essentially a reel of or meters of tight buffered fibre that a technician can unreel and glue along the inside wall of a house or apartment if you pop the cap off youll see a spool with the leftover fibre and a little bulkhead that connects the outside fibre to that little white wire fibre
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you tried looking inside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure you have yourself some coral reef there looks like a fossil or its dead they exist off the irish coast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,coral
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ooh i have one of those i found in mexico it looks almost the same
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am by no means knowledgeable in this field but it looks like a httpsfossilladywordpresscomtagrosecoralfossil to me edit even though they should not exist any where close to ireland which is puzzeling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,had that game as a kid warning do not put your booby in there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,parallel printer switch from waaaay before usb fairly useless these days
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unless you run a museum of computers and printers nothing it was free in the sense of not costing you any money but now it is busy cluttering up your life a cost that creeps up on you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as for uses gut it and use it as a project box
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well you can switch up to wires of low voltage low amperage load the connector is called a centronics you can still find centronics to cables
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is for connecting two printers to one computer via parallel i remember using a similar device back in the late to switch between a and i was only about or at the time but this was state of the art to me being able to print in colour with the canon printer was like magic from the heavens
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ab switch box used on old computers to be able to transfer data between them circa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any ideas thanks for the suggestion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was going to say i had not seen one of those since i think we used it to select which pc was sending to the printer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its certainly large enough to hold a rasberry pi just take a dremmel and cut some holes for the connectors board mounts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i stand corrected that is a parallel printer port
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the actual port shows was called centronics was it used for anything other than printers its wierd this has male and female ends i only remember seeing cables to go from parallel to centronics this box would require a centronics to centronics cable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,certain scsi connectors used centronics you wouldnt have been able to use a switchbox with them though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i forgot scsi even existed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rtipofmytongue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how old are we talking here im trying to get an idea of what youre looking for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like the sort of applicators that come in some brands of creams for vaginal yeast infections
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats like a yeast infection treatment or a contraceptive jelly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,last time i saw something like that it was an applicator for contraceptive foam
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im thinking this is it no idea what its doing here though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what sort of place do you work at and where did you find it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its proprietary charge plug you might find a generic licensed version like linked but otherwise the device is from the era that everything came with its own plug and couldnt be swapped or mixed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just ordered that thanks im somewhat skeptical if it will work since similar models seem to be incompatible with my specific camera but fingers crossed what its claiming is true
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nnnngh im so happy we are moving into usbc world i couldnt understand why everything just had to be different even from the same manufacturer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a traffic counter miovision scout is the model
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gunshot detector maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same image too where did you find this op
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure its an airquality monitor eg scroll down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,top part appears to be a high mounted camera
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt think you were serious i didnt know they had them they even go back as far as
whatisthisthing,not_removed,glp surprisingly i was very curious to find out what it was it is not an image i myself have taken but rather something i was still very curious to find out what it was
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no kidding check out httpwwwshotspottercom they listen for gunshots from pole mounted devices that then triangulate the location and relay to first responders what a time to be alive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the ones in massachusetts are also used to detect fireworks too in springfield at least other places as well im sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting how do they differentiate between sounds a car backfiring or a tire exploding can sound pretty similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,computers analyze the sound wave with fancy math and distinguish them all microphones basically very measure air pressure at an insanely high speed like thousand times per second with that much detail sounds look very different
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just a tool for looking into tight places like a car engine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have the exact same one in my tool box theyre great for looking into tight places
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rtranslator will get you a quick answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the white thing looks like a fuse tester for automotive mini fuses edit its all part of a doll house wiring kit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like brass rivets to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hollow so theyre probably for making plate through holes on circuit boards that give electrical connectivity from one side to the other
whatisthisthing,not_removed,brass rivets is correct the drill bit would be used to make holes for the rivets edit what uvoltaicglitch said
whatisthisthing,not_removed,since this is marked solved and even mods deserve extensive postnye recovery time that doesnt involve bad jokes about dinner and a movie to date this im calling this thread done thanks to all who contributed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikikobancoin possibly a reproduction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have one just like it mine is a tourist souvenir and i would guess yours is as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,brass reproduction of a koban
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id say its at least years old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably a tourist souvenir koban if you want to figure out if its real weigh it and then see what volume of water it displaces from that figure the density and see if it matches gold or cheap china metal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hi i got this when i was in japan years ago it was a scouts event and i was bartering badges with other people when some dude wanted to trade this with me he spoke in short sentences as hes not very fluent in english but he did say it was a samurai coin is there anyone here able to date this coin or if it serves a different purpose i would be interested in knowing thanks for reading
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you still have it with you mind sharing a pic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what did you pay for it looks like the real thing would be gold and pretty valuable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry it is tucked away somewhere i think i got mine at himeji castle in kyoto
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct all genuine koban are gold though many are alloyed with silver or other metals almost all contain enough gold that they would more resemble gold jewelry than bronze this is almost certainly not a genuine old koban
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we didnt really pay with money for these kinds of events with the exception of food most of the time we barter traded using badges and toggles scout thing i gave him two badges
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah well nobody in their right mind would give out real medieval gold coins anyway but this coin does have a significant sentimental value to me so i will still keep it fake or not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shit you play hard to get
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the headlight spray nozzle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thatd be your headlight washer nozzle mercedes cls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just to avoid any confusion its the bit just in front of the headlight
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome thanks for the reply man
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a but yeah its a cls went missing which i though was strange
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it does looks like this httpsimgurcomgalleryfcsfo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe its held in just by little plastic tabs so they probably broke off from vibration take a peekski underneath the bumper the nozzle assembly might still be hanging out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are there any bolts or connectors or anything inside the hole that someone might need to reach if so its probably just an access panel for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im pretty sure its where branches used to come out of the trunk the heartwood of the tree has decomposed but the harder branch wood is still there some photos of a trunk in crosssection where you can see where the branches were edit wow thanks for the gold kind interestedinweirdlookingstumps stranger its my first and thus will always be my most treasured
whatisthisthing,not_removed,related artists work pretty interesting stuff httpmimgurcomgalleryzzbsf
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are normal branches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow really interesting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this fits in rcreepy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my dad grew up there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved this is fascinating — lived in the woods all my life and never seen anything like this thanks a million
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and a diagram of how its formed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so in a cut piece of wood those would represent the knot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just odd to me theyre so low where it wouldnt particularly be a useful branch is that just from when it was a sapling instead of those branches being moved up as it grows
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i came to ask what they found its definitely what youre describing source worked tree service and have seen a rotten stump before p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was so interesting i ended up falling into a grated reddit black hole that will not be nightmare inducing for a change
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey mate im not a moderator or anything like that i just really like this sub and want everyone to enjoy it as much as i do theres a pretty strict rule about joke only comments as in like dont post them itll get you banned you might consider removing this comment or even adding some speculation as to what the item in question is i dont think the goal is so much to remove all humor from the sub but rather to ensure that the every post isnt overrun with joke comments to the extent that some other subs allow cheers and a good night to you and yours
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exactly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and to think we all used to visit forums like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a monitor clamp like if you were going to have a dual monitor setup something like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought something like that but the holes dont line up with the standard vesa mount im thinking it may be something for like holding a fishing rod or a flag pole of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,found it at work theater lighting equipment shop a physics lab type of workplace might give a clue looks like an adjustable clamp rod clamp for a camera or a mirror or a tom drum or even a sheet music stand might be called xy or tiltpan or just adjustable if it grabs a or rod then its probably photovideo accessories i dont see your specific device but heres bunches of similar rod clamp stuff also does it clamp onto rod if so then perhaps an adjustable mount for research equipment opto bench posts are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unfortunately was left in the building by the previous tenant and i have no idea what they did the knob on the bottom is actually a handle to pull a pin allows the whole thing to spin degrees around the black mount the other knob pulls as well and allow the part that holds a pole of some sort to rotate out at most degrees
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might want to try routoftheloop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre lyrics to savage and metro boomins song no heart
whatisthisthing,not_removed,which one there are multiple tweets there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im having trouble with my phone so this might post a few times sorry found this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they told me to come here 😩
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all of them first pic is a tweet of screen shot of tweets the other r close up of the tweets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you link me to the post on routoftheloop please
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ratchet extender
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a ratchet extender but with a grip for your hand that rotates freely from the ratchet movement that lets you brace it with one hand and turn the ratchet with the other
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the part in the middle spins pretty freely and moves along the shaft on the female end it says hermaand i think it was pretty worn we were thinking it was some sort of extender for a ratchet but couldnt find anything about it searching the words on the tool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well thats definitely a drive there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is indeed some kind of extender for a ratchet for use with sockets by the look of it the spinning piece is for your hand to hold as clearly evidence by the knurling other correct answers in thread mark as solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool thats what we figured solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looked like an olive and was fairly elastic when i cut it it sliced open and did not pop like a grape is it a blood clot is it a tumor after trimming away is the remainder of the brisket safe to eat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how hard is it kinda looks like a blood clot oddly spherical though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cyst
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what did it taste like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it wasnt hard at all when pressed with the knife it did have some give but bounced back to its shape when released
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cyst might be more white than black but yes some kind of inclusion or random accident of biology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im going blood clot many years in the operating room
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved this seems like the answer thanks everyone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,webdriver torso but on reddit httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwebdrivertorso
whatisthisthing,not_removed,botnet command and control
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you tried messaging the moderator and asking him
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the successor to rstrawmen is the only real conversation i could find and noone was able to offer any tangible informaiton
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the moderator of that sub also posted the same stuff to rstrawmen the sidebar says its a bot theres on strawmen theres also rsolvestrawmen edit found comments on the latter sub saying its malware
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hipster guano performance art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no response yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these are used to hang drapes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks so much my dad was a hoarder who finally collected all his property from our house a few months ago and while cleaning up what was left behind im constantly finding things i dont know what to do with so im very glad to have found this sub and by extension you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a httpsenwikipediaorgwikisundogs to me unless it was flying around of course
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the bright ball over by the telephone pole is a sun dog i see them frequently out east
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no fear its a sun dog just means theres very still ice crystals in them there clouds and their crystal faces are aligned in the same direction causing them to act as a minimirror of the sun head over to ratoptics for more atmospherical optical fun
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not actually a rainbow but related various configurations of ice crystals water droplets including dropcrystal size shape and orientation cause a lot of different artifacts like rainbows rings crosses lines etc they have names like sundog or rainbow but theyre all variations on a theme
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it is some sort of optical illusion due to clouds does anyone have a better idea apologies for the poor picture quality
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i saw something similar once when it came towards me during a thunderstorm pretty sure it was httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiballlightning it did not look like a rainbow though more like a brilliant moving sun ball
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup you should submit this to ratoptics
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks interesting phenomenon reddit is awesome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id like to know the brand and name of the candy its adorable and im definitely gonna need more if theyre tasty help me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,give this a try
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey thanks that at least gives me a place to get them from i appreciate it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i realized that the link i gave you didnt really name the product im not sure what its official name is but its made by the lotte company i hope this points you in the right direction
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no worries i appreciate the added info and will call this one completely solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep healy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a triumph or an mg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what year did they have vent glasses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you see this in dublin ohio
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was gonna say that it looks like a midget
whatisthisthing,not_removed,almost looks like a triumph a much more pretty car if you ask me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it was an mg too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im by no way an expert on austinhealy cars but as far as i know the introduced mkii first had vent windows
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wing windows only on the last model they made the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen the one youre talking about
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the op has vent glasses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn i thought maybe that was a palm tree on the right we lack those in ohio
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt know what it was but this definitely it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eh close enough glad i got to find out what i saw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres a blue one too i dont know if theyre both his or ones a buddys plus that pic just looks like dublin hard rd maybe its been like years since i lived there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it looks like dublin but i dont recognize that spot it looked and sounded great though do you know the owner
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not personally but when i was a bit younger wed see him around parked at restaurants or wherever at least a few times a week my friends were car guys and got a kick out of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwsepuracomproductstetraaccessoriessrgaccessoriessrgfistmicrophone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well there we go consider it solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a small plate with no markings on the bottom i know it says preserves on the front but i dont know the age or purpose the plate is in a set of identical ones when i searched jam plates or preserves plates nothing like them came up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a for teacups
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be the plate for a preserves dish like that is missing its spoon or it could just be a cute little breakfast dish that says preserves on it given that you have of them im guessing the latter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwetiquettescholarcomdiningetiquettetablesettingplacesettingdinnerwareplateshtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly an olderdesign if the hole goes all the way through
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could have been a stand of some sort for example could be that but for a thicker pen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this came with some tools but i dont remember which tools it came with so i want to say that this object is a tool of some sort i thought it might be a magnetizer because there is a very weak magnetic force through the hole maybe its just old
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think thats a die for flaring tube
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when it was on etsy they described it as cool vintage tall frosted glass chrome seltzer bottle bfgoodrich koroseal red rubber bulb
whatisthisthing,not_removed,honestly the first thing i thought it looked like was an httpswwwgooglecomsearchtbmischqantiqueembalmingmachinebottle that someone stuck an httpswwwgooglecomsearchqbfgoodrichenemabulbtbmisch on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks more like an antique pump for some type of automotive fluid especially with the branding
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive got an identical one that came from a church kitchen so id lean towards something that can be squirted out like maybe a flavoring for shaved ice or syrup for ice cream
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should ask around in httpswwwredditcomrbottledigging
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the tip posted bottle there also still no idea what this is used for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure the stainless steel nozzle part is a fitting for tubing its for aspirating something when you google bf goodrich aspiration bulb there is a link to an antique breast pump but it looks nothing like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that part of the potato was green
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the outer layer of a potato turns green when exposed to sunlight it probably contains measurable traces of solanine a poisonous organic compound normally found in the stems leaves and flowers of potato plants but no way in hell does it have enough that you should care
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same as the others if a bit of the potato is exposed to light while its growing itll start producing some of the same compounds as the plant parts that are aboveground one is a toxin called solanine but its rather mild eating a lot of green chips might give you a stomachache eating one or two will pass unnoticed the green is from chlorophyll but it indicates sun exposure so you can guess that theres solanine too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks to be a rolling door roller httphomelicoukrusticahardwareindustrialminimalistslidingbarndoors
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it measures about x inches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could this be something from a boat or an old wagon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah definitely an old barn door roller here is a similar antique one keep looking you might find its pair httpiimgurcomaayzyhnjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow you guys are fast i think youre right although we live in a fairly urban area i wonder how long ago there may have been barns around here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved just found its pair too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they were also used on sheds and garages
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are typically called barn door rollers but would have been used for garages as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and now hgtv uses them for every room
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its httpwwwtripleccomproductsrallyemontecarlogrillebadgebgestmo it didnt come with the car
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this on top of a buick logo on a buick enclave edit could be a encore as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats impressive that you were able to identify the vehicle model
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id call it the the adjustabill if it were up to me edit this felt like it could be helpful in google searching adjustabill came up with a patent for a hat bill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no luck so far but my search revealed another interesting ball cap visor invention
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is as close as i can find and also is that obama
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i imagine its too obscure to have a unique noun probably gets called something like baseball cap with detachable visor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as an amateur photographer something like that would be very useful when doing hikes etc when you might want to use a pop up flash for a quick shot right now i have to turn my hat side ways and often forget to turn it back
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yamakap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,closest thing i could find so far still looking though also found this but i cant get the images to show so idk what it actually looks like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say its something to do with a golf cap i found some odd patents for folding brimvisor golf caps but nothing quite like that one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could the part thats around his head be able to fold up under the bill and it becomes like a normal ball cap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why not the convertabill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gonna let this slide
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that facial hair tho
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very popular with asian people on the golf course a lady i got paired up with was wearing one a couple weeks ago
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like barry someone should ask him
whatisthisthing,not_removed,let me axe you a question where do you guys get those hats with the bills over the ears like that i go into all the city stores and the only ones i can find are the ones with the bills in the front
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you think it would be easier to unsnap and reattach the bill than to turn the hat sideways
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks a bit different is the image
whatisthisthing,not_removed,terribill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at first i didnt like it now its growing on me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt actually look at the face until you said something i thought it was a woman
whatisthisthing,not_removed,korean dude
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an ushanka the russian hat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahhh ty not knowing what it looked like was driving me nuts haha

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a usaf challenge coin most units have these made and sell them as fundraisers andor give these away as morale gifts or awards particularly at going aways or retirements unit commanders may also purchase their own to give away as gifts they can also be made to commemorate an event or milestone in a unit like an outstanding unit award traditionally these are to be carried with an airman always and when in a bar with your buddies if you pull out your coin and slam it on the bar everyone else must follow suit if you dont have a coin you buy a round if everyone has a coin the original challenger buys a round i dont see this done much these days as alcohol and drunkenness are becoming more and more frowned on in the af they may still do this more overseas than stateside most airmen collect coins from throughout their career and keep them on special coin displays or in shadow boxes i have about of them from my yrs so far in

whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the kind of like the swiffer hand duster with replaceable pads
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at first i thought it was part of a magnetic gyro set
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a handle for a lint roller
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there any kind of logo or insignia on the handle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think this is right had one almost exactly the same a microfiber pad slips over the wire loop and velcros to itself at the bottom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive just never seen a wire one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fuck thats why it looks familiar and now i feel even more unsure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or one of those swiffer disposable dusting things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can see that my friend found it in her apartment though and she said it was a fixit thing i know left by her landlord it really does look familiar though so maybe a lint roller handle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill have to report back to you on that looking for a friend but like for real
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have pne like this or finally threw it out some had big artificial feathers for dusting ceiling fan blades and another had a big pad with a washable microfiber pad for cleaning under refrigerators counter top appliances home depot will have something that fits

whatisthisthing,not_removed,rhelpmefind might be a better place to ask
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does state something about a stovepot making realistic noises and there are a number of batteries required so it seems entirely possible that its a part of the set just need to figure out where p it could also be part of a stove teapot or kettle from elsewhere that was added to the set but i cant find one that looks like it would go with it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for keeping a cricket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think it goes with the set but dayum that kitchen set is incredible what a wonderful gift for the kids
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there an accessible battery compartment any markings or part numbers in there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my kids have that same kitchen the noise they are referring to comes from the heating element itself it senses which potfrying pan is on it and makes the appropriate noise as uwifflehat suggested i am pretty sure this is the top of a toy kettle but its not from the set in the picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so its not part of the set judging by the video for it on toys r us but i want to know what its from now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,surely if it came with a play kitchen and it makes bubbling noise it is a pot boiling on the stove
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be the top of a kettle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im thinking like this or a stovetop teapot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought too based on the oval shape and the fact that the shiny finish is only on the top portion i has to be a lid for something but it looks more like a teapot lid than a kettle only thing is teapots dont go on the stove so they dont make boiling sounds but then again kids toys are not always accurate to real life edit on second thought it totally looks like a kettle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks generic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the alabama logo is fancier and its been that way for a long long time i think some kid lost hisher little league hat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats the embroidery on the side say
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i actually found this hat in a park a school playground maybe years ago in western new york i posted in a crown down facebook group but nobody seemed to care about it so ive kept it and it has been one of my favourite hats i could never figure out what team it was for and i extensively looked up the logos on both the back and front the hat is made by new era and the size is if that matters thanks in advance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe it was for a local team
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it might be an old braves hat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems big for a little league hat none of the highschool or college teams around here have that logo either that i have looked into
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a new era logo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it does but i had a friend in little league that had a giant dome and they had special order his hats and helmets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im no help sorry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an old soccer ball which was cut open and then placed over the base for what was a basketball hoop either they did it so no one would cut themselves on the pipe or to keep water out or some kids just took an old popped soccer ball and stuck it on there because kids do things like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have a photo that isnt as far away from it as you can be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could beits been there for three years but i swear it almost looks like a type of plastic you just cant tell from the picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and its had that same exact dent in it for three years too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shower curtain hook
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could you try asking them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i want to post this to of the stuff here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a pair of garden scissors used for cutting flowers it holds the cut flower with the black part a similar tool can be seen here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are httpwwwcenturymailcomflowerscissorshtml the part in between the finger holes and the blade is for stripping thorns from roses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,random guess with flowers here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you google image flower scissors theres multiple pictures of them you can mark solved and sleep easy now op 😆
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like pinking shears but the one blade is inserted backwards
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess is kitchen shears for cutting up chicken
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fish scaler and tail holder for when filleting fish maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont believe they ever figured this out the first time it was posted probably just some ridiculously specific thing only a few people have even seen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like pinking shears but i think the flowers call was right also whoever is downvoting reasonable answers stop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fabrics scissors are like normal scissors but bigger and the handle is slightly angled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre thinking of pinking shears these are not them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hubcap implies wheel so id say this is from an

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i checked that site before i posted i didnt have much luck i think it was brand new in i got it when i got out of the incubator in the hospital not sure who gave it to me though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes i might do that thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,carving fork
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry for potato quality my phone is years old and dying found this in a bed and it fell out as i moved it i cant see any clear markings on it so i am guessing its a very very sharp serving fork edit knife to fork cause i am tired
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it appears that forks like that typically come from india and are most commonly found in a double set a knife
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a monster killer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also can stab meat bags in the goo with it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a meat fork you hold the meat with the fork while you slice with a knife
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its actually the sharpest serving fork i have seen like i have one in my house and its not even close to as sharp as this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats most likely what it is just fancy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is the kousa dogwood fruit found in the fat

whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you so much most informative

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it really is so much so that i couldnt let it rest i had to know what it was again thank you very much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,line level with chalk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely not a chalk line nowhere to keep the rope chalked early chalk lines had a bowl of chalk that the line would pass through not unlike modern ones also the level on the thing itself would be completely useless when setting a level grade with a chalk line the level has to be on the line itself preferably at the middle of the two points to give an accurate reading maybe some sort of ship or marine tool would love to know cool find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a masons line winder but i cant find a picture that matches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a snaplinelevel tool pull the line taught and straight pull back the line and let it go it will chalk the path of the line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does the peice the latch unhooked from look like it could slide onto a nail head there is a small groove on it look like you could set that side on a nail set the other side on something else and level it then pull the string between them to create a movable flat string guide like for laying block or leveling boards over a long distance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,builders string
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it almost reminds me of an antiquated version of a chalk line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think the line is meant to be used directly from the spool the level has tabs on the ends and i think youre supposed to hook the line there when you have it stretched from whatever you attached the other end to thereby putting the string as close to same height as the level as possible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep agree came here to say this as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think you use the line directly from the spool you just store it on the spool you would loop it around the tabs on the blue housing around the level after attaching the other end to whatever youre working with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont really see how it could much else then again theres a lot of surprising things on this sub
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a masons line winder yeah since it has the level bubble its for something like that possibly for building fence also
whatisthisthing,not_removed,haha its not an old school chalk line i was thinking that too but with it wrapped like that it would be near impossible to apply chalk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it can be used to measure a straight line on many things i used one to cut the tops of a fence i erected just find the height you want and then once the bubble is level you snap the string and it will leave a chalk mark on the surface of your project that you will use to cut a straight line it is used a lot in masonry to make a straight and level brick wall chimney or what have you you simply have someone hold one ond and once you have the unit at where you want to cut you hold the other end of the string taught an inch or so above the surface and then snap the line against the surface and it leaves a chalk line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its for laying out a string line to level your brick course
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the thing that broke offlooks like chalk to me that sort of looks like one of those insects a type of wasp i believe built a nest i have those things here and they do that in everything in my shop that has a hole in it its white sandy or chalky looking stuff but then it looks scrapped on that side so it might well be chalk for marking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it exactly a meter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think that rules out any use as a chalk line if it is used as a measuring tool you would not cover it with chalk
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mud dauber wasps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a vintage gallon oil can
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for what purpose how would it be used
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im guessing here but it seems to big to be practical for oiling train parts directly so maybe oil for the lamps on a really old train or refilling the smaller oilers they use to walk around lubricating moving parts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they made hand pumps to fit gallon cans like that since it doesnt have a spout it was most likely used with a pump to fill smaller oilers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen one of these on a mailbox in my neighborhood it flips up after the mailperson has opened and closed the box this allows the person in the house to see if the mail has been delivered yet heres a link to one for sale on amazon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,object hollow plastic yellow ball something inside that rattles around the ball is maybe attached to a long spring that is held with a small groove the plastic mounting bracket has two screws for mounting to something at work we put stuff in the mini fridge that the object is taped to and when we unlatch the spring from the groove it stands straight up so that we know when there is something in the fridge im not sure if theres a similar purpose to the item when its used normally it apparently cost around wherever it was bought probably walmart or something and by the time i had the idea of posting it i wasnt able to ask where this was foundbought
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe a device to make a door spring loaded so the door will not stay open
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this it was on the what is it segment of ask this old house season cant remember which episode though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved i definitely think this is it i honestly couldnt think of a good use for it that wasnt similar to what we were using it for funny enough its a very similar purpose thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reminds me of the flag you put on your pole when ice fishing

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a fidget toy i dont know much more than that but ive seen a bunch of people making them on youtube
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are all over redc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,btw op i lost mine recently near work this week did you find this in boston by any chance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,obvious advertising is obvious
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there a joke im missing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah this is stupid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow til everyone but me runs around with a weapon if its not a gun its a knife
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no sorry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its literally viral marketing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it worth the price
whatisthisthing,not_removed,knives are not weapons they are tools i keep telling people that but the mall ninja types wont listen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahhh bummer was hoping to do the wow small world
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its pretty awesome it spins very well and for a long minute spins i guess you could go cheaper but a lot tend to be printed and the texture would be grainy might not be worth it for everyone but i get a lot of use out of it and enjoy it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how often do you need a knife as a tool in everyday life
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yea its actually a friends contrary to popular belief this isnt an ad and i genuinely didnt know what the heck this was
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i use mine once or twice a day cutting or prying things i dont brandish it like a maniac or take it out in the wrong place or time do i need to have it probably not but its certainly been more useful than not for the past five or six years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i use my knife almost daily i carry plus a multi tool that also has a knife
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just about every day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tokens are used for marking the human body during xrays r for right side l for left
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved wow thanks everyone that was amazingly fast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,xray tech here imaging markers to mark right and left side of images and that card is showing different codes used in a hospital code red is a fire etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone from the radiology department is probably really frustrated with themselves right about now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it would be really a good deed to return it to the hospital it came from hospitals are not really happy to have any form of id laying around
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i really want a pair so i can have them made into cufflinks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you found something on a random sidewalk wrapped in medical tape and your first reaction was to unwrap it id be afraid of finding a finger inside or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,now where i work a code brown is something completely different than facility on emergency power its a lot more brown if youre picking up what im putting down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,crap something i finally knew and i found it latewomp womp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,clearly youre a main character in a japanese survival horror game and youre just looking for hints
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wheres the j one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,finally something i know this is a hospital card of some sort maybe an id you can see the different color codes and what they mean those things on the id stick to the xray machine to shoe the right or left of the persons body to make it easier for the radiologist reading the xray
whatisthisthing,not_removed,followup question what does activate surgery beds code purple mean would that be for a mass casualty event
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a hospital emergency card it lists various emergency codes and related procedures not sure what the tokens are for likely some medicaltherapeutic use that is just taped there for the convenience of a doctor or nurse who owns the card edit why am i being down voted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is correct that card its tapped to is for the different hospital codes source so is a nurse has this card
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i got so excited that i actually knew what this was i always see things posted here and have no clue what they are i figured someone would beat me to it i see xray techs use these on a daily basis in the pacu
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i never knew these existed but i want a pair
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you often see radiographers with a metrelong tape hanging round their necks for measuring the distance between the tube and the patient with these markers attached to either end of it for convenience
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im only six hours late to give the answer d oh never mind c
whatisthisthing,not_removed,should bring it to the nearest hospital and ask if anyone has lost it im not sure how expensive the tokens are but itd be cool as shit if you found to whom that belonged
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would you recommend your field im leaning towards pharmacy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep to expand and actually answer ops question its a hospital badge with a quick reference list of code calls and the tokens are leftright xray markers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well dont keep me in suspense what are they and why would they be taped to the card like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would explain the medical tape
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id be curious to know if anyone from this sub has gotten some kind of disease or gross sickness from picking shit up off the ground and taking pictures of it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah no
whatisthisthing,not_removed,surge not surgery and yes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep i agree nurse here xray techs used to come around every morning to do their chest xrays on our tubed intubed patients every day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,had this card op has it now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is a code brown my mind is wandering
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am an xray tech and yes then person would be very grateful they arent usually expensive but a pain to replace they normally have initials as well as l or r so they are normally custom ordered and take a bit of time to replace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well it has basically nothing to do with pharmacy but i enjoy what i do it all honesty i went into it as when i was trying to decide what i wanted to go to school for the money is decent note if youre american this varies state to state and employment chance was good as long as youre willing to move ive been working in xray for about years also went back to school part time and now do mri and ct scan as well keeps things more varied and interesting being able to work in more than one area typing all this on my phone at hopefully i answered any questions if you have others just reply here or shoot me a pm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im pretty sure those are the little things they stick on the xrays to tell the person reading them which side its on i vaguely remember a tech sticking them on something and that card looks like something that would be hanging behind an id badge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they work like this they usually show left and right in some way and in many cases will have a hospital staff id to help confirm who captured the images the latter being done to make it easier to work out which imaging staff member or team took the image this also makes working out a whos who when files get dropped easier to sort out some more example images
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its when someone shits in the pool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the most depressing code on the list my so has is a code pink cardiorespiratory arrest neonatal age
whatisthisthing,not_removed,howhow did op get it from my so that cheating bith
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the third image shows it the facility is on emergency power
whatisthisthing,not_removed,things i never expected to see made with glitter those skull shaped ones would also be a little troubling to see an xray tech pull out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks what do the other not l and r letters mean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,glorious georestrictions a book the fragile xassociated tremor ataxia syndrome fxtas ebook pdf is all i get with that link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a bunch of questions for you thanks in advance for answering whats a typical day like for you are you rushing around or do you have down time are your hours consistent or do they rotate weeklybiweekly is there drama in your department i hear some medical departments can get packed with drama is there a lot of employee turnover in radiology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry i keep getting interrupted kids are whining about dinner or something ridiculous like that im not in the medical field but i do get quite a few xrays im pretty damn clumsy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes the code brown cliche is pretty well known
whatisthisthing,not_removed,code pinks are never good news at our hospital its missingstolen neonate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,spent a year in iraq so much sadness especially were kids are concerned
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they never overhead those they stay in the nicu
whatisthisthing,not_removed,poor you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like the hang loosepeace ones with skeletal hands
whatisthisthing,not_removed,p for posterior from the back and a for anterior from the front the smaller letters are for personalization you can have your initials or whatever youd like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats an xray tech make these days
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how does these work with airport security
whatisthisthing,not_removed,didnt know that but in the uk we tend not to expect to sue everyone into oblivion every time something doesnt go exactly as expected
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how is that hand even still hanging on there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why you gotta be so grumpy youre the only person on the internet that doesnt find someone shitting in the pool funny
whatisthisthing,not_removed,people steal babies what even is a baby good for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im happy to say that doesnt happen enough where i am to warrant a specific code not that the others get used often except missing patient i feel like every day theres a missing patient from the mental health ward
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are any codes ever good news
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems to that just screaming baby thief baby thief over the loudspeakers would be more effective i know i sure as hell would start to help if i was visiting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,code brown in my hospital is missing adult patient it still makes me laugh every time they call it overhead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aha thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,typically x rays but maybe they are expanding on their skill set to include mris or ct scans
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh it was funny alright back when i was and the joke was first made its just so unoriginal and your nudge nudge wink wink code brown get it comment was just a bit sad
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unfortunately code pink was at my hospital was for abducted child code white is the worst one imo pedo medical emergency
whatisthisthing,not_removed,crazy people who want kids and money mostly a baby can go for a lot of money to the right parents
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when my brother and his wife were leaving the hospital they had two id checks with two people at each station to follow it up they take blood in case there is a need for a dna test
whatisthisthing,not_removed,konami
whatisthisthing,not_removed,different countries is my guess my so and i live in canada i suspect the codes are the same canada wide excluding quebec
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unfortunately the public is not particularly good at identifying suspicious persons particularly in something as highstress and exciting as a baby abduction i predict that would result in lots of amusing but potentially quite dangerous and violating tackling of unusuallydressed women or shiftylooking but otherwise innocent men
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is an approved dad joke response well done
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this was funny well done
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure its quite that simple there are many cases where people are legitimately harmed and now have lots of costs as a result in addition a person may not have long term disability insurance in these cases you may need to sue to make ends meet in addition there are plenty of examples where the person suing is doing so reluctantly such as when
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it literally if i lived there would make me less willing to do many jobs i often wonder how anything gets done on your side of the pond as it must be wrapped up in masses of paperwork and red tape id love to see a side by side comparison of a common ailment and the typical process around it being treated the paperwork and diagnosis in the us and somewhere else like the uk or australia i cant help but feel that anywhere else the steps involved will be drastically shorter with the american option being filled with indemnities and forms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh fat burn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe we can use the things op found to help see the stick up your ass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you really getting this upset because a guy on the internet was being silly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good god yall
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how did the pedophile injure him self
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really i have identical twins i could sell one in that case and lose nothing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,v v b a select start
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right and hospitals are overly concerned with law suits im just one of those people that believes peoples feelings should be put aside in an extreme case like this but i also understand im in the minority
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well done which around here is quite rare
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to be honest as a doctor we see many more ridiculous lawsuits than actual ones where harm has occurred i was sued for correctly fixing a womans leg because any pt can sue a doctor for anything they want to regardless of the care received etc the case was dismissed after initially going to the courts and i was informed that i could then countersue for malicious prosecution as the judge said her case was ridiculouswithout merit i declined to counter sue in any case this is one of the factors which significantly drives up medical costs in the usa lots of defensive medicine being practiced and the legal fees incurred fyi average insurance cost per year for a surgeon in new york is around per year if a surgeon does cases in a year thats an extra per case that patients incur indirectly so that back surgery where the surgeon is is going to the insurers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the longest step on the american side is people being unwilling to even seek treatment in the first place no insurance or the cheapest insurance you buy just because its illegal to not have any and a hospital stay could bankrupt you so obviously everything will be more difficult to treat it you wait for whatever disease or ailment to progress farther
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it makes you feel better im not at all upset
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ask someone who works in adoptions how much a white baby goes for on the private market note that private adoptions range in legality depending on where you live
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im just one of those people that believes peoples feelings should be put aside in an extreme case like this but i also understand im in the minority perhaps much worse you start yelling baby thief all over the pa system and you are gonna freak out worry all the people who are actually sick in the hospital could you imagine lying in bed recovering from heart surgery only to have escaped mental patient blasted over the pa system what if you just gave birth and that shit is over the pa how about if you are in grandmas room while she is on her deathbed baby thief sorry my friend they do these codes for very good reasons
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you really steaked your claim to that one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,first read that as missingstolen neopet and had to do a double take then go get another cup of coffee
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ba dum tiss
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did i just witness a joke being created
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its been around a while but i saw the opportunity to use the punchline
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would you please look here for a second httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfuveyclqjdi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can anyone make out that signature im color blind and bad at cursive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just a generic painting thats been in my grandmas house forever heres the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a dog tag silencer on a brand collar edit like on this one they call it a muffler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it rubber
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this would make me sad because i love the jingle of my dogs tags on her collar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpswwwalibabacomshowroomnfcdogtaghtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thats definitely it but what does it muffle exactly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably silicone or some kind of plastic they feel a lot like the bumper cases for an iphone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i love the jingle because i can tell where my dogs are in my house when i can hear them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the jangling sound dog tags make
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its to keep tags from clinking together i read once about someone who for some other reason did something that quieted their dogs tags and were surprised to find that other dogs no longer barked at them as they walked by
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the sad onion logo is normally found on toys so id imagine its some sort of toy probably a puzzle where you have to figure out how to get the ring off the coiled bit of metal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a puzzle literally you try to link and unlink the ring with the spring if you cant do it the instructions tell you how once youve mastered it you get friends to try the linkunlink thing then show off your prowess when they fail thats the idea not a scooby why its in a glasses case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the good old spring and a ring an oldie but a goodie
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ashens
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sad onion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,funnily we just had someone open one in a christmas cracker it seems to be a popular inclusion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats exactly what it is loved making my friends feel stupid with this toy when i was younger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i put it in the case so i dont loose it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the hammer attachment from a vintage multitool kit edit this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i remember thinking it would take a man years to tunnel through the wall with it ol andy did it in less than twenty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,toffee hammer used for breaking up toffee and hard candy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its for breaking candy or brittle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they used to bash in the skulls of unwanted babies with those youngling crackers they were called but in all seriousness i think ive seen similar hammers on small tool boxes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i came here to post a shawshank quote tips hat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,very possibly a chip dryer for an osb mill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like some sort of silo or a fermenting tanktower for a brewery without the base on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,saw that at and winder hwy in dacula almost posted it fyi it looks to be stainless so i assume maybe a food related item
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinda looks like a a vessel used in the coker process of oil refining
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a transportation enclosure for a turbine engine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,either that things moving right along or theres more than one i saw one in augusta today around pm didnt see the chase car but i might have just missed it it was sitting in traffic at a light and i was going the other way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,drum for a rotary wood chip dryer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats not how we ship aircraft engines do you mean a different type of turbine engine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah ha no worries
whatisthisthing,not_removed,without seeing the back or how it attaches it looks almost like which is a handmade pin from nepal it is not quite the same as the one pictured on this soldiers which has some sort of crest above the center of the crossed knives
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just wanted to say respect for not wanting to wear a piece of uniform
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,with that fitting it looks like a cap badge a search gives gurkha staff band as the most common result although it doesnt seem to be worn on photos of the band
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a part of the royal gurkha headdress badge worn with a royal crown in between the crossed blades sometimes also worn with a number in between the crossed handles to denote wich brigade the wearer belongs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the beret badge the little metal arms on the back go through holes in the beret then the split pin secures them in place it wouldnt be disrespectful to wear it on a beret but it would be really weird looking wear it as a pin if you feel the need to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the knife is nepalese called kukri httpsenwikipediaorgwikikukri
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant open the link for some reason but its attached by a split pin type thing through two eyes at the back yeah i thought maybe as it doesnt have the crown on it its probably not part of a uniform but i thought maybe someone else might know better than me thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i support the gurkhas and i dont believe they get enough respect but having never served i dont feel that i should be able to wear an actual piece of uniform its just disrespectful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a slight correctionthe crown and the crossed blades are made as single item link jim b
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to me if its part of a uniform i feel that i dont deserve to wear it thanks for your help though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure op covered that in the title of this post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not exactly what you were after but ill add to the conversation that split pin in american military parlance is referred to as a dammit they are used on the backings of american pinon military rank including that which adorns the headgear when struck unexpectedly against a hard surface eg a tank tube or a track vehicle door frame they tend to dig into the wearers scalp this causes the wearer to exclaim dammit i hope you enjoyed my addition to the thread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is the full link maybe i embedded it incorrectly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,enlisted ranks are a normally one piece item officers badges are commonly separate pieces eg royal marines and royal signals corps have a separate crown attachment that affixes above the badge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my bad i was half asleep
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know this one ill post a link if i can find it in a moment its a remote and charger for a small remote control car the car snaps onto the center part to charge like a cordless phone edit the one i had looked httpwwwchinatoyfactorycomrctoyminirccarshtml im still looking for the exact match edit i cant find an exact match as yours but im certain its similar to this

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe this item is called alam panja hamsa or hand of fatima its a protective amulet not sure what this particular objects purpose was but it may be a flagpole finial im not sure who the figures represent though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i found httpfarsicalligraphycombrasshandintheformofabirdmiddleeastern which is similar but could not find more information
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where exactly are you seeing writing i see a picture of four people and a bird
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the presence of figures make that its probably not a hamsa islamic culture prohibit such representation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the hands of fatima that ive seen are all oddly symmetric unlike this one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no writing just hieroglyphic type pictures
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was my initial thought as well i am certainly no expert in islam but its my understanding that depending on the erageographic origin and as long as figures are stylized and treated more generically as opposed to idolatry sometimes there is leeway in figural representation to make my point the hand itself is a figural representation and historically the hamsa appeared frequently in islamic tradition

whatisthisthing,not_removed,that makes so much sense it belongs to my partners roommate who now that i think of it is one of those smoothie nuts always making protein shakes and avocado broccoli kale whatever

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i used to make them too one of these were in the plastic bottles associated with them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for starters those look to be of much nicer quality than a tourist sale set i can find very similar spears from that fit the wwii time period if the oss had your grandfather roaming around africa they could be legit

whatisthisthing,not_removed,accumulators
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some kind of accumulator low volume but high pressure by the looks of things see three valve actuators as well on the panel i would guess something that requires hydraulic pressure to operate and is on an automatic pump system in the event of power failure to the pump or mechanical failure you still have the reserve pressure to activate whatever this runs jetway or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess is a high pressure hydraulic reservoir for the jet bridge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they have it right my best guess is to provide emergency hydraulic pressure in the event of power or pump loss

whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a demonstration steam engine toy or teaching tool you put a candle under the boiler and the wheel will spin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are no markings on it it looks like its supposed to hold a tea light inside of it and it appears that something is missing from the top of it we work at a hospital archive if that simplifies things but it may be unrelated to the hospital altogether any help is much appreciated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,steam engine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it might be a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup old model steam engine always neat little things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably more of a model than a toy or learning toolthey are actually really cool once you get them running
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a small sterling engine you can see a video of a diy one in operation here the red part is a flywheel which keeps it spinning and the tea light provides the energy the little knob on the top may be able to be unscrewed in which case you can fill the upper part with cool water as a heat sink if its not corroded itll likely still run though it might need a bit of oiling to make sure everything moves freely theres limited energy in a tea candle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a steam engine not a sterling engine though the water will vaporize and go into the cylinder which pushes the flywheel due to the crank and the anchor point the cylinder will pivot in the other direction releasing the steam through the small hole next to the pipe the momentum will pivot the cylinder back and the circle will start over fill in some ware and put a tealight below then when warmed up give the flywheel a little push
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also the valve is a steampipe itll make a painfully loud sound when opened under pressure also watch out for the steam it may sound stupid but its quite easy to get burned by it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,taking a closer look at it i suppose youre right good observations
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its white fluffy material
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe something like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a vent filter which goes on the inside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why do you have it on the vent and not the return
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks right it was affixed by velcro

whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre welcome

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i never understood that last part dont want a kid to get it as if a kid who finds meth knows what to do with it and if they do they probably already got some crystal

whatisthisthing,not_removed,dishcloth very common model in sweden
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dishcloth they are multiuse but use very hot soapy water and wring out they usually have designs on them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in canada its similar to httpwwwjclothcom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the real question is why theyre in a clothing store
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you dont have these in usa what do you use instead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why have washing instructions on a dishcloth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they have a home section now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we have dish towels theyre just a different type usually small towels like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive never seen a dishcloth for sale in the us but theyre a very popular project with knitters and crocheters ive made stacks of them for my own use and as presents if you try to make them nice rather than cutesy you can use them as trivets and doilies as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this for cleaning or drying
whatisthisthing,not_removed,closest thing in the us would be a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,after use you can wash them and reuse instead of throwing them away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are for drying these are for scrubbing dishes or wiping down the counters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,like httpswwwhandiwipescom were such a disposable society
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh goodness this made me laugh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahh gotcha in that case we just use spongesbrushes to scrub dishes or paper towels for the counters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the equivalent in the us would be a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why its the truth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or a paper towel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these are more absorbent than sponges
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because the joke plays on the idea that there are people that throw out their dish cloths instead of reusing them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the joke is that youre putting a dishcloth into hot soapy water a lot so its already clean why clean something thats clean id still wash it shit gets nasty yo you could say that bath towels never need to be washed because they only ever touch a clean body but we all know thats not true either
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you dont use paper towels for washing dishes though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ofof course you wash them both
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no i use a sponge and scrubbie i dont use cloth towels for proper washing either i might use an handiwipe to rinse but most likely just use my hand drying is on a rack unless i need it right away in which case id use the aforementioned terrycloth dish towel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the switch on the side is making me think it is some kind of power failure lighting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more info and overview pic this is in croatia i can reach the switch but i dont want to flip it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why dont you call the front desk and just ask
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like how you use bananas as a measuring device haha to me it looks like a very modern light of some sort does it light up could also be burnt out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a towel warmer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it smell like anything whats between the sheets of aluminumcolored plastic does the clear plastic go all the way though which room is it in is it plugged into a power source which country is it in and most importantly what happens when you flip that switch fwiw ive tried reverse image searching paired with the following tags extinguisher repeater femtocell emergency dehumidifier freshener heater and light no bueno
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youre right about it being a light but im not sure about it being emergency if so it would probably have a push buttonspring test thing instead of a toggle im guessing this is right over the little coffeestation area in most decent rooms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why the hell not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not sure why this was downvoted but this the easiest way to get to the bottom of this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does not light up there is a normal light just besides it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpknowyourmemecommemesbananaforscale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope
whatisthisthing,not_removed,too far to sniff there is more plastic between the shiny parts its just by the entrance i did not flip the switch its in croatia edit nothing seems connected but the wiring may be in the wall
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe it is just the angle of the photo but appears to be a bit too close to the ceiling for a coffee station light op can you reach the switch easily
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its by the entrance near the ceiling no coffee there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it may sound an alarm if its some sort of smoke detector or worse cut off my wifi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cuz it is a logical answer and reddit doesnt like it when you point out that op could answer their own question

whatisthisthing,not_removed,if i may ask why have you been living out of hotels for years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well that was anticlimactic httpiimgurcomljlyejwjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op likes riddles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well i will put it like this you can its one of those words that is misused so often your point is still made clearly but the s is extra and not necessary also what is your native language if you dont mind me asking i am a polyglot and enjoy learning new languages and helping people learn english edit going by your name may i guess german lothar was my german name in high school inspired by your question i did more research and i have found httplearnersdictionarycomqadifferencebetweenbesideandbesidesprepositionadverb helpful guide i am one of those people that just knows when to use a word but this website will explain in detail the difference between beside and besides and when to use one or the other what a great question i learned something because of you thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,most appropriate misspelling ever
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a light ud keep on at night with kids
whatisthisthing,not_removed,old job i traveled sitetosite to do installs theyd usually put us up in extended stay places but depending on the area those werent always available so wed stay at whatever was there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i lived in a hotel for three years once at wk it was cheaper than an apartment and came with maid service okay it wasnt a great hotel but i had a large room with a fridge coffee maker microwave cable tv and free local calls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hilarious
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so its a light but you may well have killed the entire hotels wifi and sent off a silent alarm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the anticipation was probably sweet though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well now whats that thing underneath of it on the wall
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the tips my native language is polish and my english is mostly self taught started with undubbed cartoon network and expanded through computers and later the internet now im learning norwegian much harder to do because all norwegians speak perfect english

whatisthisthing,not_removed,almost definitely heres some
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes this is most likely it thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what do you use it for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a mouth harp to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont see how that would work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,twas my thought as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seriously
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its supposed to be mounted on a long pole at night you take a lantern and your eel spear and set out in a boat to hunt for eel when you see an eel you spear it with your spear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,spearing eels
whatisthisthing,not_removed,anything can castrate you if you try hard enough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for a giant maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh i see eel spear eel spears not very sportsmanlike
whatisthisthing,not_removed,friends mom told us a story of a friend she had got into an accident and flew out the windshield hood ornament tore his package on the way out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more like mm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well its not really made for sport its made for getting something to eat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,u can always try noodling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats unsportsmanlike about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nomnivores know this kind of thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the eel doesnt get a spear too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im imagining that being said like hobbbes talking about tigers and its made my day good start to the new year
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know if youre very seen an eel kill something but its scary also they dont taste good dont eat eels
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they creep me out i aint getting anywhere near them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the fact that some of them are living stun guns really creeps me out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre there to make the lines visible to taller boats and landing aircraft pontoon planes for example commonly seen around smaller airports edit available from httpsprtechcomproductcategorypowerlinemarkers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sometimes they are weighted as well in exceptionally windy areas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are these the ones right next to dover bay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are radar reflectors also
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and helipads especially in rural areas with smaller less visible lines source we have of them extending along lines near our helipad
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the speedy answer everyone the boat was trying to figure it out solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats an interesting fact we kinda assumed the opposite and that they had the capability of floating to make repairs easier i did have my doubts though berceuse getting closer i was almost positive they were made from steel it was hard to tell because theyre actually much higher than they look in this photo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no the things you linked to are threecorner reflectors which are hoisted in the rigging of yachts and are much larger these balls are simply to enable light planes float planes to see and avoid the wires no planes with suitable radar would be flying that low except maybe miltary jets on training runs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope there would be no use for them there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really kinda figured that out as a child
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they probably arent solid because i would think that would be too much weight but im just speculating they might float but i doubt it plus you dont want live wires in the water im pretty sure theyre just weights that let the lines sway in high winds rather than whipping around where theres a greater chance they would snap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,on second view the first link might be wrong but the second one is definitely correct also ships bigger boats also have radars thats why my first guess was radar reflectors hence the lake in that case the reflectors are placed in front of unlit obstacles to prevent accidents
whatisthisthing,not_removed,our thought was that it would float the line if it broke because it was only over the water and the lines are waaaayyy too high for any boat in this lake to hit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,granted it would be neat to put radar reflectors inside these balls trouble is they are too small to have much radar crosssection for safety reasons lowslung powerlines rarely cross waters where big ships can go and small ships and helicopters etc just dont have the right kind of radar to detect small reflectors source retired marine radar surveyor who also did a lot of work with power companies fixing their radio interference problems
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and how drunk were you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not at all i dont drink and drive in absolutely any vehicle why so hostile is this not the exact purpose of this sub the genuinely difficult to figure out is what goes viral but i dont care about that i was just seeking an answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well it has been covered in this sub more than once
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes and im not a frequenter of this sub so i would not have known that had another thread but been linked how exactly aside from your complaining is this post negatively affecting your experience you could have just scrolled right past it but instead opted to needlessly incite conflict over it it was marked solved long before you showed up and went absolutely nowhere karma wise please take your bitterness somewhere else because its certainly not needed nor appreciated here thanks buddy

whatisthisthing,not_removed,what should i do with this

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a gear i spent some time trying to track down the exact type of gear and the closest i can find is called a httpsenwikipediaorgwikicycloidaldrive by wikipedia theres a gif that shows how it rotates in your example youve got a gear with teeth rotating inside a hole that has teeth there are videos at youtube about cycloidal gears but i didnt see one that exactly matches what youve got

whatisthisthing,not_removed,heres a link to that exact one wow aliexpress links are enormous
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a puzzle box solved i think there is a puzzlers subreddit actually
whatisthisthing,not_removed,puzzle boxes are usually well boxes you finally open them up and there is room for something inside was this one hollow inside if not then it really looks like a burr puzzle with rounded edges
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reverse image search brings up now how to solve it i have no idea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you start by pushing inward toward the center of the piece on the two small rectangular pieces in the center of one of the faces you will have to determine which one only on one of the sides will they move inward then pull out the opposite side then it will be loose and all the other can be worked out its harder to put back together so take photos i got a cubic one in on an elementary school field trip to the united nations and still have it but i remember it took me about years to figure out how to put it back together
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah the taking apart was no problem its the assembly someone else took it apart and handed me the pieces
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would it be better to post there for the solution portion you think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not hollow it was basically a solid block when put together taken apart by a friend with no idea how to reassemble
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oil and vinegar container
whatisthisthing,not_removed,put redwine or balsamic vinegar into the smaller chamber olive oil into the larger chamber
whatisthisthing,not_removed,may i ask why is this does the vinegar get any property from being surrounded by oil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks fancy one liquid suspended in another one of a different color
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its just a serving container for salad dressing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well reddit gave up on this pretty easily wtf is that thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it was not so wobbly i would say it looks almost like plastic slag or some such thing grossing me out though that is for sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,literally the only thing i can come up with is possibly a bryozoan or moss animal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be a fungus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mutinus elegans not sure if they come in green but it looks close to this and can be found in that part of the country
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be a broken piece of fishing lure they can get kinda gooey as they break down and start to fall apart
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where i found it is nowhere close to a body of water
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this looks promising except the strange thing was found away from standing water besides rain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be but i havent found anything in searches that look close
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am pretty certain that its organic but i could be wrong im going to try to have it sent to a lab on monday
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you figure it out i cant sleep at night
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my girlfriend bought these for me from sweden they appear to be brass with a pale blue enamel it is the strange pin back which i cant seem to find anywhere when searching for it im not sure how to describe it when put into a shirt they slip through the button hole and bind the cuff together quite well the marking on the pin says pat april jewel were just curious about them

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a whole house water filter it is usually hooked into the incoming water supply i dont know why someone would only filter water going to a shower
whatisthisthing,not_removed,easy way to tell is to turn on several faucets then close that valve
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe it just appears to go only to the shower but actually goes somewhere else inside the wall righto you may have it all figured out already by now but for those who may wonder about their own setup the filter body has an arrow on top showing flow direction right next to that red push button the red button releases air when a new filter is installed the water is turned back on push it down until water flows steady out of it and do have a small bucket to catch it hah closet as seen in your photo is the input feed side where the shutonshutoff ball valve is output side of the filter shows the piping leading back into the wall on your hot water tank the feed line for water coming in to be heated is usually on the right side where you see the copper coil pipe then the heated water exits on the left side to your sinks shower tub your filter may tee off somewhere and also feed the hot water heater or may not anyhow find the namemodel of your filter and can likely find a manual online and sizetypes of filters it takes if same size types can be interchangeable between brands i like whirlpool when to change it has variables how much you use how much sediments in the water feeding into your house it filters the quality of your filter im on shallow well water great stuff tastes so good compared to city water yet has more sediments which a similar filter does very good at catching so though a quality filter can last six months to quote the manufacturer i usually change in that time hope this rambling helps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks like a size x to me i like to keep an o ring for the housing on hand when i change i havent needed it yet but i dont want to need to go out and buy one filters are specified by flow rate and what stuff they filter and tend to be or if they havent left you a you may wish to get that at the same time as your first filter often outside faucets for hosegarden are before the filter so you could run an outside faucet full for a minute and then fill a glass to see what taste and odor issues they might have been dealing with you can see what sort of flow rate you want for a replacement by httpwwwpurewaterproductscomarticlesserviceflowratesforwholehousefiltersizing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ywelcome
whatisthisthing,not_removed,drton good info also i guess op ulockhopper will get this even as you replied to my reply also to have use with each filter change is food grade silicone for the filter body threads the gasket either wipeon grease or spray on the grease ive seen sold in same dept as the filters gaskets by the filter companies at least at lowes home depot and theyre little bitty tubes i think is an expensive joke so the spray can i bought at ace hardware and goes years futher having used both i also like the spray to really saturate even using either type silicon the body may get really stuck tight when comes time to unscrew it so make sure the plastic wrench is up at the top of the filter body and with your other hand bracing opposite on the piping even then ive heard these plastic wrenches do break but i just use a rigid pipestrap wrench from my old steam boiler days hah that sucker wont break

whatisthisthing,not_removed,capsicum corer was my first thought
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in diameter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know what to tell you i checked the frequently asked things and the wiki did a reverse lookup search and nothing came up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im just amazed thats its reached so many different people who also find this subreddit and none of us can figure it out well get it one day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this one was found in a kitchen drawer in australia by a facebook friend of a friend who then asked her friends list i thought id try here and see i kind of expected id find it in the faq to be honest oh well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its been posted about times in the past week
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its been reposted a couple times already each time zoomed and cropped a little more than the last i had to scroll back four days in the feed to find it so its not like you could have searched for it anyway we dont know what to call it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so wheres everyone getting the exact same picture so bizarre
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry to bother you it wasnt on the first few pages the wiki or the frequently asked things list when i posted i see its been stickied now so that will probably help

whatisthisthing,not_removed,you guys going to drink it now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it comes in handy all the time often to the extent that i forget that other people cannot do it the problem is that there are similarities to greek and i naturally assume everybody knows the greek alphabet because of standard mathematical notation and such but that is false also

whatisthisthing,not_removed,you could try rchemistry or rchemhelp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,first off i dont know what this compound is scifinder a database for chemists doesnt seem to know either the fact that its a tattoo makes me wonder if the client intended for this specific molecule to go on their bodythere are a lot of incorrect chemical structures that people have tattooed on themselves out there this may supposed to be a glycine and an incorrectly drawn phenylalanine residue attached to something else glycine and phenylalaine are two amino acids two of the protein building blocks in our bodies the amino acids have single letter codes to identify them ex glycine is g and phenylaline is f so sometimes what people do for fun is put together a the gylcine and the potential phenylalaine arent attached to another amino acid the bit theyre attached to could be some quinoline derivative but im not sure again im skeptical that this tattoo was drawn properly to begin with a lot of quinoline derivatives are used as pharmaceuticals and some as recreational drugs but that might not have anything to do with the tattoo assuming this compound is actually drawn correctly that its not a botched amino acid code message andor some sort of drug reference it could just be something that somebody was working on in their researchjob alternatively somebody just thought it looked cool and wanted a chemistry tattoo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where did you find it looks similar to something ive seen in the last few days reading about medicinal chem

whatisthisthing,not_removed,id love to unfortunately my friend who took the photo i posted no longer has access to whatever the hell it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this and the sister injector tester have this infuriating feature along with non replaceable batteries i have to keep them separate from all my other tools because every damn time you slam a drawer on your toolbox shut they turn on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,context then where did he find it what was it with etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i could not get close enough to see what the writing on the back window says i think that it was only a twodoor possibly had a halfdoor on each side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you looks like they were made in a city close to where i saw it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think so they were built in norway and that picture looks like it was taken in north america
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in november they began manufacturing them in elkhart indiana and i was close to elkhart when i took this picture there are more details on this in the wikipedia article linked by uwidelegger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh i see i feel sorry for elkhart p
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre there to remove the dust from shoes and wheels theres a bunch of layers the numbers are so you know youre only removing one at a time and to let you know when youre running out httpwwwamericanfloormatscomcleanroomstickymats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we use these in construction once the finished flooring is installed to keep from ruining the new carpet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is situated such that its difficult to get on or off of the elevator without walking on it any shoe soles or wheels passing over it leave distinct dust prints it is replaced daily with a new or number on the white square in the corner i initially thought it was a way of cleaning off peoples feet when entering the building but the changing number in the corner makes me think theyre keeping track of traffic or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this reminds me of the blue goo from portal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,again i know what it is but someone beat me to the punch p can confirm theyre used to remove dust and particulates from your shoes i work in a clean room and we must use these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you da man thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope we use these in the lab and the number is so you know how many sheets are left before you need to repace the mat depending on traffic the layers could be removed once a day or as needed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its for use with the corkscrew you brace it against the top of the bottle to give leverage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its literally just a noveltyambient light sold on aliexpresscom it is a heat sink but theyve mounted the light inside it to create an interesting novelty multi use light the factory that makes it makes a lot of stuff made from parts originally intended for use in other products source i have the exact same one bought from stated supplier with a brighter white led in it on the wall in my hallway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like some sort of glowing heatsink there was only one in the room its about inches in diameter looks very cool i have no idea what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cpu heatsink with blue led
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i wonder why they didnt have more it stood out like crazy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you by chance have a link to this seller i want to see what other contraptions they have come up with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its literally just a noveltyambient light sold on aliexpresscom could it also figuratively be a noveltyambient light
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aliexpresscom found after a bit of digging
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you tried too hard and it doesnt work im embarrassed for you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you literally tried too hard and it figuratively doesnt work im literally embarrased for you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen similar things sold as picnicbeach cupholders you plant it in the grasssand and it holds your cup or bottle upright
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for context i work in a cell phone repair shop and we just got a large order of these i have no idea what they are
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre called beach spikesbeach spikers httpwwwspikercompanycom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yard coaster or beach cup thingy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what a time to be alive back in my day we had to cut down a tree to get a log so we could set our beer on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was going to be my guess as well it certainly appears that it is something to be stuck into the ground
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe your shop is going to sell them as an accessory people can use to keep their cell phones handy dry and sand free on the beach
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the log not the stump
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pfft you were lucky back in my day we had to catch and train a pterodactyl to sit perfectly still so we could rest our rockbeer on its bill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen them used for that before the first time i saw them i thought they were a ridiculous accessory then my beer spilled in the sand it was a sad daythen i bought my one of these suckers and its great for drinks keys phones shades anything you want to keep from getting covered in sand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats better than anything i can think of im going to ask some questions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh a pterodactyl you had it it easy my entire family of kids had to round up enough protozoa to form a ring then wed pour the beer into the ring my dad had to lean all the way down to the primordial ooze and slurp the beer before the protozoa died wed have loved to have a pterodactyl
whatisthisthing,not_removed,willlllmaaaaa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,first time ive ever laughed out loud on reddit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at this point it could go to pretty much any brand of laptop they make the httpwwwworldstandardseuelectricityplugsandsockets easily removable for easy swapping or replacement it also makes it easier to make one ac adapter and then throw in the socket required for that country
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dell tablet charger
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lots of stuff uses the which is what that is but yeah its most likely for a smaller dell laptop edited for link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpiimgurcomfedtyvujpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it does say dell ac adapter on it so is probably correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think we figured it out as a rama temple coin

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a picture taken in a ski cabin there are other hand tools hanging on the wall plane saw etc there is a blade at the end and a spring that you cant quite see in the picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whatever the answer is comment here with a link providing proof and ill sticky it the original thread
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant provide a link but can confirm as i did on one of the previous posts its a clothes peg these were sold as such in south africa where i lived for a few years i guess the logic behind it is that you can just take one out of a bag any which way and snap it over the clothes and line without having to orient it first or press a spring mechanism my wife has also confirmed that she remembers these from the midlate as cropping up in laundry baskets at her moms house we both remember them as being shitty they were prone to breaking as they couldnt stretch wide enough to go over thick fabric and clotheslines and their brief popularity was probably the result of some shortterm advertisingpricedrop campaign to offload them ive spent a few minutes googling but could not find a link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think that it is for cable management
whatisthisthing,not_removed,itt everyone has a different answer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a cell phone stand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a bell pepper deseeder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it go in the middle of a record with the larger hole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok my brother is in africa i have him on the look out for these wish me luck i requested he either take pictures of them in use on a clothes line or a picture of them for sale in a store in their packaging
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any chance it is inside out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my coworker who knits alot said she used to have a yarn separator that looked like to this she said that it was a very old piece of equipment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for carrying plastic bags
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like you can wrap some kind of cloth or paper around its edges making a long flower shape the clips on the inside keep the cloth or paper from slipping out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,reminds me of the sock clip my grandmother uses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what are the chances that someone just printed this on a printer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i once used something very much like this to align fins while assembling a toy rocket in school
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a chip clip so if you have multiple ones you can stack the bags you want folded up and give yourself space while keeping everything fresh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it a banana cutter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im about sure this is a rug braiding tool though i dont know what its called or how to find it the holes appear absolutely perfectly designed for this purpose the center areas make a running fold on three long strips of fabric you would feed the strips in and the device folds and holds the three strips close together to be conveniently braided before the fabric has a chance to unfold or fray i have never seen one but if this item was not designed specifically for this purpose i would be very surprised
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sigh i bet it would still get posted a few times a day i guess we could put it in the fat it is frequently asked not that anyone seems to read the fat either
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this post is locked you wont be able to comment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you been getting a ton of posts asking what this is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its ironic that i never saw it until it was stickied now its always at the top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a sturdier version of this would be awesome i really like the design not having to try and orient it and it seems like it would be good for disabled or elderly who might have less fine motor skills
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id be down with this if the center prongs whereby present they add a complexity to the design that suggests a more specific purpose in my mind
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pending someone finding an actual link im going with the clothes pin theory multiheaded clothes pins are a thing patents and and as noted by utotalinvisibility below those inner prongs are part of a known though currently uncommon clothes pin design see the link below also from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,googled different clothes pins and found httpwwwhellotradecomningbosunwerindustrialclothespegsplasticclothespinshtml it says they are from south africa and they do look similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwweklipsellccomeklipsellcadvantageshtml although not threesided and without the flimsy bits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but can i prop up my cell phone with it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thatsthejokegif
whatisthisthing,not_removed,combination cell phone stand and earbud cable keeper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,close httpswwwaliexpresscomcheapcheapgrocerybagcarrierhtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i want to look more into this because the thing looks overengineered to be designed as a clothespin but knowing about rug braiding i wouldnt know where to start maybe its a failed product that was rebranded and sold in africa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the same answer i gave last time glad to know im not the only one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats why the instructions said to post here in this thread like you already have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was popping up almost every hour yesterday haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mean theyre functionally no harder to injection mould than these
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive asked friends still in south africa to find some proof but so far none of them remember ever seeing these the inner prongs were too flimsy and broke quickly and while i remember having dozens of the bloody things in a variety of colours their weakness could have caused them to go off the market really quickly i distinctly remember regular annoyance at taking one out of the bag and having to rotate it round and round looking for prongs that were still stiffwhole enough to work and throwing out ones where all three had broken this must have been over a prediod of a year or more and i think many years later there were still a handful of survivors mixed in with more traditional pegs in the peg bag hanging from the back of the kitchens outside door will report back if i hear anything but can honestly confirm with certainty that at some point about years ago these things were sold as clotheslaundry pegs in south africa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im fairly sure this thing was found in australia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry knee jerk is when someone says here and posts link i think they mean there sorry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a zurna similar to an oboe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shehnai
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i reckon its a httpsenwikipediaorgwikishawm originally a medieval european instrument they are still used in military bands in middle eastern countries particularly turkey they come in different sizes and slight regional variations this looks like a soprano or sopranino size here is a httpwwwdudyeushawmsgasopraninophp made by a present day manufacturer they are pretty loud and would normally used for outdoor performances must admit though that bottom hole actually on the flare does look strange and i havent seen that on a shawm zurna or shehnai perhaps its a fake just a decorative piece that cant be played
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mizmar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a bombard or vombard to me used in traditional breton music
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks an awful lot like an irish instrument called a httpsenwikipediaorgwikipracticechanter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this seems similar but all the images of the zurna i found seemed to fewer holes than this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a stainless clampstyle end cap is a type of stainless steel is a link to a similar product
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it kind of looks like a blind flange for a quick clamp sanitary tubing connection like if you look at this picture you can use a blank flange in place of the second pipe to the right the groove in the ops pic would be where a gasket is seated
whatisthisthing,not_removed,triclamp end cap as others have said often used in brewing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe the back of a watch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it does look quite a lot like that but it seems fairly big and heavy to wear on your wrist supposedly the person who bought this found it in a hardware store
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a glass break detector for the security system i install them myself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lowprofile smoke detector
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ultrasonic glass break sensor for the security system tap on a desk with a pen or coin near it and youll see the light blink at each tap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a ceiling rose of some kind could be an occupancy censor for the security system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the dot on the right occasionally lights up red no idea how often or for how long though as its on the ceiling every time i see it it immediately turns off i imagine thats because it just blinks for a second but doesnt stop my idiot brain from telling me im being watched
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly a wifi repeater or a mesh wifi network
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this was my first thought as well had one in my bedroom as a kid and if i made loud noises it would flash a little green led i guess it was showing that it was working or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its either a co monitoring device a fire detector a light sensing device for turning on lights or a motion sensor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i think you nailed it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,co or fire detector makes sense discovered there is also one in the kitchen probably not light sensor as those are on the switches in every room thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,next time op is near it he can clap once and if it reacts thats almost certainly it however mine was old and this one may be new so its possible this one is much more properly tuned to whatever breaking glass sounds like bit its worth a shot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,powder from chips and spices gets stuck and builds up in parts of the machine in theory they shut them down to clean frequently but every once in a while youll end up with a chunk of that food stuff getting knocked loose and in a bag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a piece of the chip material that was never formed into a broad triangle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so have you licked it yet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be for doing tracings is the top translucent or transparent to light
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hmmm i cant think of what else it could be but those movable wooden levers give the mirrorillusion away dont they
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some kind of camera obscura httpsenwikipediaorgwikicameraobscura
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think so one of the pieces mentions orientation with respect to the screen if this was a magician trick i would think the screen would be to let some light in so that the audience could see better but the mirror is angled wrong for that i would learn more towards either a lighting tool or maybe something for a projectionist will link up with some people in stagecraft
whatisthisthing,not_removed,almost looks like a traveling shoe box with a tilting mirror so you can check out your digs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this a second attempt op we had an item that looked quite a lot like this a month or two ago but i dont think we got a firm id on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like this idea but it seems like it would be easier to just put a light in the box instead of rigging mirrors and such
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes this time with more pictures from more angles with it put together
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be a heat issue specially if its from the days of incandescent bulbs could also be for tracing slides from a projector if the top is translucenttransparent ill bet this is it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably the httpwwwtheappliancecliniccomelectricrangeblockedventhtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,part left over after a new one installed like the pipe near fan
whatisthisthing,not_removed,motorcycle spark arrestor prob not

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oops title should read travels all the way to the top of the tree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for running audio over ethernet cables
whatisthisthing,not_removed,actually that is an adapter for cisco voip phones
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could you elaborate like if you have a stereo somewhere the amplifier someplace else and you need to connect them via an ethernet cable for some reason and wouldnt you need the female jack slot for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you get two of these one on each end of an ethernet cable itll run the signal a lot farther than a regular cable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you put two of these on either end of an ethernet cable youd get a really long aux cable and probably a lot of hum because ethernet is unshielded
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and wouldnt you need the female jack slot for that not necessarily male to male cables are common
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cat are available in foil and braidshielded formats just fyi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,typically youd never do this for audio as the unshielded cable would pick up noise badly instead we use httpmuxlabcomproductstereoaudiobalun small transformer boxes that adapter the signal from unbalanced to balanced and back this looks more like a straight adapter which could be used for getting ethernet or other signals into a device like an old tablet or similar ive also used similar pigtails for hooking up to old security cameras
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cat are available in foil and braidshielded formats just fyi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure but the shield wont be grounded through this adapter as its not a shielded port they also dont shield the individual pairs from each other until you get to really high specoddball cat cat is not a specification its a marketing term so you get bleed between channels
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more importantly is this safe to eat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes your mushrooms are rotting the ones in plastic packages presliced are prone to doing this would not suggest eating them buy bulk mushrooms store in paper bag in a cool dry place and slice as you need them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope thats mold if you can get a mycologist to positively identify it and tell you whether or not its toxic then it could be fine to eat itll probably be a lot cheaper to just buy a new pack of mushrooms get whole mushrooms next time theyre easy to slice and they keep longer

whatisthisthing,not_removed,orange striped emperor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe a little over a foot long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,striping similar to some tetra photos ive seen cant remember what the commercial was but these fish were jumping up a river similar to how salmon do maybe it was a salmon but i dont think it was

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont want to sound whiny and i dont regret posting this at all but can someone tell me why i got downvotes for future etiquette reference was it not interesting or detailed enough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solvedthanks i was looking up shark teeth and fish teeth but narrowing the search down to rays didnt even cross my mind even though arent they related to sharks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why i got downvotes you did fine with describing what you knew gave its size where was found and the photos of course bases covered without then these are the usual reasons for complaints ha this is reddit after all so consider the source its about that downvoter not you for some will complain just because they can or its sunday not friday night whatever now watch me get downvoted for this hahaha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i didnt say much because i couldnt quite tell i was pretty sure it was organic but even that was in question since it does have a plastic kind of feel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe i would need to look at the back side of it for a label
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if theres no label or markings it would be impossible to tell theres probably a name on the sound board but that is sometimes different that the piano maker at one time every furniture shop used to make their own they would buy the soundboard and components from a handful of companies and then build the piano locally heres an incomplete list of makers httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofpianobrandnames
whatisthisthing,not_removed,look on the back side one of the upper corners should have a label if its not there open the top and look in the center also close the key cover and look for a brand its an oak upright but there were so many brands its no one can guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in the absence of all labels open up the front and the brand and serial should be cast stamped into the lyre frame
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a garnish spear a quick google search turned up plenty of hits heres an example page to illustrate its use httpshomebargirlcomtagelemakuletikibitters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant tell if this is a meme now or what the deal is these have been posted times now in the past days on this subreddit and it has been solved every time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just got these in the mail as a freebie for being in the titos taster club but im not sure what they are theyre metal copper and about inches long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for spearing olives and whatnot in drinks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks guess i was googling the wrong thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh oops i havent seen any of those posts didnt realize i was repeating yeah it was a promo so i think they all just got sent out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup awhile back you could sign up with them to receive free promotional stuff i was hoping for something better than garnish spears buy they are pretty nice so whatever
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i bet youre right i didnt even think of that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is craftsman some might consider it transitional to art deco but i think the motifs are a little earlier in any case pretty building
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we call them brownstones in mpls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this minneapolis
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks an imitation of the or at least the ornamentation in the brick how old is the building or its probably not a single design style just a mix of whatever was popular at the time and whatever the builder knew how to do as far as brick accents definitely has some art decoish flair to it too although its definitely not the fanciest of examples i dont see how its craftsman style at all unless youre just looking at the porch roof which doesnt look original to the building
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op where is this id love to see a straighton view the proportionsguidelines on this are really nice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its got elements of art deco and also classicism also its pretty awful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this in queens
whatisthisthing,not_removed,art deco
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it favors colonial style much more than craftsman just google for pics of each
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely a conglomeration art deco vertical brick designs prairie style bricks greek revival fluted columns i know love and own craftsman and i would not have labelled it craftsman op go with prairie style for more points
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i needed this for work and im rolling with that solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry i cant say
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for your insight i believe you are correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey thanks for saying that particularly coming back after all that time to say it you make reddit a better place
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jeepers thank you double quite a nice thing to do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a firing pin for a rifle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,second this i own an and first thing i learned to do was take it out and clean it actually real simple
whatisthisthing,not_removed,likely some kind of document holder could be that workers place things there for others to pick up the wires just keep the caps from getting lost
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the contents of the documents would probably tell you a lot but i cant imagine what possible purpose something with lots of rolled papers and wired up with alligator clips could have im going with crazy person project
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpimgurcomazwdct maybe a homemade spotlight is that a filament in the top i didnt see any motors to move it thats a lot of wires just for a bulb im hoping to see the owner and ask
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks an awful lot like a light but if there were a bundle of wires going to it maybe an antenna i knew guys who drove a chase vehicle for high altitude weather balloons and they would rig up custom stuff like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,about ten inches tall i guess it had a bundle of wires going into a back window i looked inside but the van was so full of trash i couldnt see anything useful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does not look like any antenna ive seen before its not cb or amateur radio or public service no need for multiple wires for typical mobile antenna it does not look like a direction finding rig which would be the only case i could think of for multiple wires for a mobile antenna
whatisthisthing,not_removed,at first glance i thought it was a radar thing like self driving cars have but im almost positive that isnt it unless its some sort of homemade version of one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id also like to know maybe it holds something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,telematics device without its exterior cover probably a company vehicle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe a custom war driving setup omnidirectional maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be an expensive viper
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id say it almost looks like some kind of transmitter with that little rod on top of the cylinder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a lamp with a reflector backing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct it is a spotlight this one to be exact its remotely controlled the bunch of wires are for controlling the pan and tilt looks like the van owner just made their own wiring harness
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it resembles an antenna at first glance but there are some differences the bracket base and mounting hardware is dont look like antenna parts i agree it looks like a light it seems recently installed the black is nice and dark maybe something like a microphonespeaker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is the word youre looking for but yeah this isnt one my first thought too though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought speaker or air horn too but those almost always have an outward curving shape maybe a microphone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it comes with down winter coats on the tags to show whats in it i keep mine in the inside pocket for good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill buy it for shmeckles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this one doesnt look like down to me probably polyester
whatisthisthing,not_removed,halfcabs its a small non articulated hauler that can haul long things ie long pieces of steel can stack along the sides beside the cab getting them into tighter spaces that a full semi might not be able to do theyre not super common obviously their utility advantage is pretty minimal imo you can get the same thing done with other trucks but what do i know i dont know anything about the types of companies that would choose to use these maybe it makes total sense edit link fixed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a version of what we used to call a city truck which are generally used in warehouses shiprail yards etc because they spend a lot of time moving trailers and can turn sharper due to their shape which is a big help in backing trailers constantly and maneuvering in tight spaces you can also see better from them just a guess though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was going to say its a yarder they are used to move trailers around in the storage yard and need good visability
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are called pipe trucks its for the best view possible for very specialized cargo here is a really weird one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks very much this makes a lot of sense
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i work for a steel distributor we have one of these trucks im sure its useful but i have a good feeling it was fairly expensive and its kind of meh in my eyes it may be able to pay for itself eventually due to having less axles and a lower registered weight vs a normal truck and trailer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would it also increase fuel economy by decreasing cab weight and crosssectional area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive always heard those called yard trucks or just yarders
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah those a yard trucks they have a single seat and the cab is far to the drivers side with an easy walkway to get to the gladhands
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im sure there is but i dont know if its a particularly advantageous amount its still a regular width medium duty truck at the chassis and engine level i wasnt able to find specific specs to compare so take that with a grain of salt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep youre right couldnt really remember what they called them but now that you remind me thats it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no wheel so not a shunt truck jim b
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wasnt suggesting that the op was a yarder just that id never heard the term city truck the ops truck is a halfcab flatbed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok got it jim b
whatisthisthing,not_removed,medical questions are not permitted in rwhatisthisthing try raskdocs or consult a local doctor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it may be agatized coral
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a mammal tooth hard to tell without multiple angles and something for scale youd get a better chance of id on rfossilid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the term is vented helps with fogging air flow etc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you know the brand and model my initial guess is to prevent then from fogging up
whatisthisthing,not_removed,speed holes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep thats it i didnt notice when i bought them in a hurry and its somewhat distracting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a cheap set looks like images eyewear might be the brand i guess that makes sense to keep them from fogging but theres a lot of light that gets through and it seems kind of counterintuitive could just be a well meant but poor design though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ucoppercaptive shared a link that seems to confirm this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks underripe except for the darkest grapes in the cluster i used to grow a variety called frontenac that would ripen unevenly like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,unripe any grape variety that doesnt get enough warmth or sun in its ripening season will be like this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like wine grapes to me but i cant identify the varietytry barbera
whatisthisthing,not_removed,concord i believe

whatisthisthing,not_removed,secondgerman city been there mark it solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a hat pin from oberammergau in southern germany
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it might be a fractional distillation column for an industrial plant someone said something about a natural gas plant i think theyre used there to clean the gas i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be part of a chemical plant waiting for install if the site theyre installing it in to isnt ready for it yet and they need to close down the road to transport it t might just be sitting there parked up waiting for installation what sort of industries are around there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also see the semi truck behind the witt for scale it is big
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these folks think it may be some kind of power pole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this seems to go along with the refinery theme ive gotten from people on imgur too thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i live in central kentucky not really coal country thats more of the eastern part of the state one of the bigger industries in the area is manufacturing particularly the toyota factory in georgetown ky however that is a good minute drive from this rest area where i live is mostly agriculture i do remember something last year about a proposed natural gas pipeline somewhere in the area perhaps it could be tied to something like that however i am not sure anything like like is happening near where i work and live i could be wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting its funny the windmill or turbine theory has popped up a lot in town as a possible explanation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no they dont one comment said power pole and had no upvotes the comment that it was something from a refinery or other industrial process had four upvotes it is not a power pole or wind turbine support i think it is a httpsenwikipediaorgwikifractionatingcolumn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,judging by all the pipes protruding out of it at various levels it really does look like a fractional distillation column maybe the installation site isnt ready to receive it yet or they are waiting for over size load permits to come through
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be something for dairy processing or is it grain crops in kentucky
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would love to find a pic online of another fractional distillation column just to prove it because it sounds like the correct answer of course im sure there are different styles of them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was a lot of tobacco and horses i dont know if you know this but we kinda have a horse fetish in this state we love those bastards there is a dairy nearby in the town i live in that supplies multiple grocery stores including kroger and savealot stores

whatisthisthing,not_removed,from what i read roaches frequently look like this after molting when they shed the exoskeleton most of their pigment can go with it probably no big dealno different than others that are brown but probably wont have the same satisfying pop if stepped on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks just learned something new
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh thank god i was here thinking i had a hivemindlike colony of roaches and just pissed them off by killing the queen or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe its a cutting board the pattern would keep something like a chicken breast from sliding around while youre trying to cut it the channel that runs around the pattern collects the juices
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how big is it given the tiles below it doesnt look that big not big enough for a chicken breast i think this is actually a ginger grater you rub raw ginger on it and it separates the pulp from the fibres i dont know if the wood points are sharp enough though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,meat tenderizing cutting board edit example
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wouldnt it be absorbing all the meat juices and salmonella and stuff i thought it felt like a tenderiser and then said no because wood huh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the tiles are pretty big about it would be a smaller cutting board about the size of the ones you make a sandwich or chop a few veggies on or a really big ginger grater the points feel about as sharp as the ones on my metal meat tenderiser or meat hammer as my little brother dubbed it many years ago so i can see either use
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im with you on the ginger grater given the size is correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,surprisingly wood can be more sanitary than other materials if properly taken care of just one article i found about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the is a model patek phillipe started selling in the however none of them used this arrangement for the secondary dials in fact no patek phillippe to my knowledge uses the layout with the three dials to the left when they have three secondary dials theirs are always oriented to the bottom of the face without more information id be inclined to think its a knockoff the was a very expensive watch when it was new and genuine ones sell for over today its quite likely there were knockoffs made
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im pretty sure that is a replica
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looked through some vintage watch catalogs and couldnt find anything hard to even place and approximate date on it the numbers listed bring up a different style maybe a vintage counterfeit id say email patek and see if they can help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey folks had this floating around for years but never really paid much attention to it i know pateks are held in high regard but i cant seem to find anything on this one in particular the back of the case isnt very interesting its brushed stainless and its stamped with the following patek philippe geneve swiss made any ideas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved not very exciting sadly but i think the consensus is that its an erm interpretation of a patek philippe so to speak thanks for the replies nonetheless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its some sort of electrolytic cell those two terminal posts connect to the anode and cathode and the vial would be filled with an electrolyte solution not certain what it would be for though its definitely not a hps bulb as its meant to be opened rather than being a sealed tube
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it potentially has acid mercury and several other chemicals so treat it as at least potentially toxic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some type of speciality light bulb possibly a type of highpressue sodium hps bulb
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i think you are on to something there thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,let me clarify toxic as in dont break it dont drink it dont spill it wash your hands after handling and dont throw in the regular trash not run from the room screaming toxic probably no more dangerous than a car battery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good guess but i dont think that is it there would be a lot missing for it to work as a lamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,found it its a wiki link httpsenwikipediaorgwikichromicacidcell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i said bulb not complete lamp the contacts on it might just be posneggrd
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just dont get what it is used for sorry not an english speaker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,opbe cautious the inside of that item may contain hazardous substances however it is a great example of old technology
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lamp is actually the correct word for what you refer to as a bulb technically the bulb is just the outer envelope the lamp is the whole assembly decent
whatisthisthing,not_removed,according to the link given by uhmchuckles it looks to be the battery when filled with the correct acids for the telegraph machine that the hospital used to use
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as unanananabatman said its an old type of battery possibly used as a power source for a telegraph medical devices or a phonograph and your english is rather good for a nonnative speaker
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah we havent touched it because at first we thought that maybe it was radioactive or something along those lines i will be sure to mark it down as potentially hazardous thank you for the warning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for the clarification
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you for your compliment and your help i think we can consider this one solved thank you again

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was captured somewhere and send to new mexico to be used as a range target testing weapons on enemy vehicles is far more efficient than using your own often obsolete vehicles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok couldnt get too much from my grandfather who is a mason hes and tired the viking ship is associated with knights templar a masonic body basically just a way to identify yourself as a mason
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know that has masonic origins ethiopia has also been offered up as a possible origin to the pin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a generic viking ship
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there really should be an ask a mason subreddit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,while it seems to depict a bireme the vikings never used those kind of ships its of greek origin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well considering that theyre not supposed to write anything down it might not be very revealing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from the thumbnail i thought it looked like httpswwwgooglecomsearchqalligatoreyetbmisch maybe from a toy or something
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my aunt found this thing on the beach in galveston i have done reverse image searches googled the description of it looked for input on facebook etc no luck the picture and her description are all i have she said its hollow on the other side hard and not slimy like you might expect i thought it might be something related to the shipping industry thats heavy in the area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we thought eye at first too but you wouldnt expect an eye to be hard or notslimy also i thought the slit was a little too jagged to be an eye
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it organic or something like plastic or other manmade material first thought was a sea beandrift seed but now not so sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe the false eye from a taxidermied alligator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not really sure the info above is all i have she just said its kind of hard hollow on the other side and not slimy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it an egg case for some kind of animal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it might be thats why i reverse image searched it but it yielded no results i assumed if it was some type of egg it would be easily identified by a reverse image search
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like httpsenmwikipediaorgwikivelella to me ive seen dark blue ones and also clear ones like that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,must have been a migration or something in your region several people have posted asking the same thing over the last couple days
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these were scattered all up and down zuma beach at the tide line the upright sail is paper thin the lower area is almost corrugated with concentric ridges on the bottom side they are fairly firm and very clear some had a blue tint on the corrugated part they shrivel and turn white when dry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah its a desiccated velella velella without the blue part
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is exactly what it is thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool the wikipedia says spring often finds large strandings on beaches of the west usa starting up north and working down southward i tried looking for other posts about these but this sub moves fast
whatisthisthing,not_removed,indeed it does ive found them for years but never bothered to look them up very cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,removed see link provided below
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was in a local news article found on a beach by a lakelake is not near an ocean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah whoops my bad i mixed up two tabs its should have been to a different thread a bit earlier today with the same question changed it should be working now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think its an opium pipe i collect those whatever it is dont try to polish it or you could end up erasing the very nice patterning
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more pics httpiimgurcomomyljkejpg tip of inside tube note that my granddad had inside httpiimgurcomomyljkejpg it says nai keim bee prince siam about
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is that pen hollow maybe its for snuff or something else snortable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im betting thats a case for a single cigar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely wont ive watched too much antiques roadshow to kill the patina do you have any pics of your collection
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this antique dealer believes that its a cigar case yet note that the url calls it a scroll case since this would likely have been part of a set with the same pattern on all parts its possible that the slender tube doesnt even belong inside you could try contacting these people to see if they have any ideas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes it is the end is partially crushed bent down and it looks like it was meant to hold something

whatisthisthing,not_removed,nice try russia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,starting charge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats how freedom looks my friend
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had never before even thought about how jet engines start up i read the first section of that article and now have enough wiki tabs open to last me the day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely the apu worked on in af and its almost the same
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was a pretty neat video
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they use compressed air to spin up the compressorturbine to a critical speed then start adding fuel and the engine is running most airliners have an apu auxiliary power unit which is essentially a miniature jet engine small enough to be started with an electric motor the apu then provides compressed air to start one of the main engines at this point the apu can be shut down and compressed air from the running engine is used to start the others
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had a basic idea but now ive also got all the tabs open wikiwonderment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not just that they can supply electrical power air for the air con packs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i did respond to a comment linking to the wikipedia page about the apu which i read and expressed wonder about oh in fact thats the comment you responded to huh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes and other people may be wondering the same thing but not have the time or inclination to read through dozens of webpages
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah sorry i missed the implied for anyone else who might be wondering

whatisthisthing,not_removed,underside of a marine worm from the family polynoidae also known as the antarctic scale worm this was one of a number of deep sea specimens bought back from the antarctic as part of a biodiversity study they crawl along the bottom on those fine golden spines which are about as stiff as tooth brush bristles and connect to the ends of their many legs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is that an actual creature or weird art context would be helpful where did you find it how large is it can you flip it over and take a picture of the other side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its about inches long and one side is flat there is a hole in the tapered end that passes all the way through the pin i have a kenmore washing machine if that makes a difference
whatisthisthing,not_removed,did you find it on the washing machine behind the washing machine under the washing machine or in your jeans pocket when they came out of the washing machine does your washing machine have a model that might help in finding a parts diagram with
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some washers come with an immobilizing pin to lock the drum during transport and installation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bird eggs what kind need to know exactly how big they are but dont touch were they on the ground could be california quail if they are small inches long inch wide
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op were they on the ground or in a tree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ooh eek snake oooh its a snaaake
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i remember looking for this type of small speckled egg about a month ago and it turns out there are literally hundreds of similar looking eggs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is more clue to point to quail elevation may tell if california the state bird or mountain quail
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like the little plastic clips that were used to keep folded clothing folded you see little twisted metal doohickeys used for this more often nowadays
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre all numbered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,stitch markers perhaps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like clips for christmas lights and i can see why numbering them would be useful i cant find the exact ones though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre only numbered and by the looks of things like part numbers maybe edit i am a moron
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well they all seem to be the same except the numbers so i would say they are for tagging something while counting them you might try taking a generic photo of one and doing a reverse image search
whatisthisthing,not_removed,color size which country three different buttons does it have a barrel lights does it look like the purpose is to produce some sort of sound does it have sights or a scope or some sort im thinking some sort of signal thing either light or sound but could be a detector or please can you give more details
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could you post pictures
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it might be a radar gun or rather a kids toy version of one easiest way to test that is to go out and aim it at a car driving down the street or toss a ball and point it that way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a remote control for a rc device of some sort if it was at the beach probably a boat similar to something like

whatisthisthing,not_removed,based on this picture it looks like it might be a signal strength detector for wireless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you gave me a link which has no content and is thus both invisible and unclickable i had to inspect element to confirm that your comment was not just empty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like some sort of handheld wireless scanner but i dont recognize it and the pic you posted does not seem to have any obvious identifying features what does the front end look like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no company name or anything there is a switch which toggles the light and what looks like a microusb cable port

whatisthisthing,not_removed,so it was always a necklace edit come on it looks basically the same as
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are traditionally made of bone but sometimes cheaper ones are made of plastic use the hot needle test to verify
whatisthisthing,not_removed,never ever use the hot needle test are there short linelike markings that look darker than the rest of the piece or any pattern at all like crossed lines no matter how faint
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bone plastic no idea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was always a pendant the necklace is the part that goes around your neck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there arent any markings or pattern that i can see with my untrained eye
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like bone or ivory its nicely made but i imagine it wasnt buried too long because its so white it is a hook but hooks are used for lots of things do you have a museum near you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no we dont have a museum close that i can think other than a childrens science center in the area we do live close to a state university though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,see if they have an anthropology department
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe were looking at a hand cranked scroll saw similar to this pintrest has an almost identical example but theyre hard to link to
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yea saw this on goodwill auction site hand cranked jig saw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree the return spring for the arm looks like its broken
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh which one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibombusternarius to get rid of them youd call a beekeeper or pest control
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an for getting rid of them there are a few httpwwwdoyourownpestcontrolcombumblebeeshtm if nothing else call an exterminator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are invading my home i got home from vacation and theyre all over my house
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where in your home just flying around could also be a httpsenwikipediaorgwikicarpenterbee which would be bad call an exterminator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive knocked at least out of my windows i cant find where theyre getting in or where their hive is and i cant get any exterminators to return my calls yet its been frustrating
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is a hard drive from the days of yore i would estimate it is something like mb in capacity edit it may be one of the httpsxxlcloudcomenblogtheevolutionofstoragedevices
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like you found the e drive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,check out this tested video where adam savage talks about his collection of archaic storage technologies httpsyoutubehqwcikoqxwg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,big heavy disk drive probably
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought that looked like the rrit lab on the second floor why dont you just ask the professor or someone in the lab cage its an ancient ibm hard drive
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well now i feel old i even know that it would be called a mass storage device
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it also doubles as a boat anchor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,arcane technology archaic maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,storm drain inlet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you ever watched lost my guess would be a drain grate that has either been dumped or maybe some part of a vent stack for a septic tankother drainage system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post seek professional medical advice if you must ask on the internet raskdocs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a photo of the actual object would help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well the link you provided states that the llama is a vase so thats probably why it has a hole
whatisthisthing,not_removed,noisemaker does it make a clacking sound
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you get a clear shot of the japanese characters on the base the visible ones just say expo more or less id say its some sort of expoexhibition mascot edit looks like it was the mascot for the rather creatively named
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no idea but happy cake day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats it sorry i would have posted more pictures but im not too familiar with reddit on the iphone and couldnt figure out how to upload the rest again thank you so much it had been driving a friend crazy edit solved

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a pendant that was given to lds youth for completing a program called gospel in action back when i was about or years ago the program has since been revamped and updated a few times and has a new name of which im not aware heres a that a quick google search returned
whatisthisthing,not_removed,was he a mormon reminds me of the pendants they gave to youth for completing programs if not im still fairly sure those books are scripture the two columns of text on each page is very typical of christian scripture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he was a morman i bet thats it thanks

whatisthisthing,not_removed,neither random nor pointy nor a triangle for three
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is it a splash guard of some sorts sir why not just close the curtain they tried sir but it just wasnt enough after that young brat timmys accident what does a rampaging tortoise mopping timmy in the balls have to do with this i meant the automobile accident sir the one that took dear old timmy to the auto repair shop that dropped the tortoise of at his house in the first place its just a triangle isnt it yes it is sir
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not random its quite intended
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres honestly little to tell you from that picture as many pictures of as high quality of as many parts of it as possible will be key in giving you any sort of information jewelry is often times the hardest thing to identify from photos even more so from poor quality photos
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im gonna guess it has a religious theme because some of those beads look like doves edit im looking at rosaries and chaplets and this could be something similar edit two the imagery of the beads and the number of chains between the beads makes me think this is a very old httpwwwrosaryandchapletscomchapletsfivewoundsprayerhtml the beginning prayer beads and chain may have broken off at some point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the feedback ill ask my coworker for better pictures
whatisthisthing,not_removed,zanjir for religious selfflagellation scroll down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess would be for beating a rug to get dust out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if something is found in an old cottage rental does that mean it can never be a bdsm related item everything that happens happens in a place including bdsm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we thought it was a rug beater at first then we also thought it could be to beat wheat or beans in their raw state no idea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i vaguely remember something like this from my childhoodit was a tool for removing chaff from grain i thinknot positivegood luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chainmail cast iron pan scrubber edit link to vintage scrubber
whatisthisthing,not_removed,woah thanks for looking into this solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is exactly right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks pretty conclusive nicely done
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you we thought it was a rug beater but we can only find completely looking different floggers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was my thought too but arent the action ends of httpsenmwikipediaorgwikicarpetbeater usually rigid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,beating a rug with metal would shorten the life span of the rug very much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,freaky deaky dutch the people renting it to us are dutch haha still no idea or confirmation its got a wooden handle so i dont know if its bdsm related
whatisthisthing,not_removed,threshing flails are usually one stick chained to another one think nunchaku so i doubt its that also it wouldnt be much use for beating a rug you want something firmer and longer for that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,on this page a httpcrossbonesleathercomcataloghtml scroll down a little to see it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fair enough i mean its pretty cool if they sport that on here haha i just feel like its more tooloriented for some sort kf cottage life but i know im being biased
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would say its far more likely that this is some kind of a tool such as a rug beater or similar the links of chain look way to big and possibly to be safely used for that sort of thing without risking serious injury to a person
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no question it could be a tool for some other purpose i was pointing out that the cottage thing in the question was a pretty big preconception maybe an out of context issue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would be helpful to see what those two plates on the upright tube say
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe it is a weight loss belt machine httpwwwunmotivatingcomthestrangeworldofvintageexerciseequipment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was only passing by and i got caught up on the tag when i asked the movers about it before they loaded it rookie mistake i only took the one photo i zoomed in and i can make out ek health builder and manipulator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that did the trick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,still not entirely sure how one uses it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,check out the newspaper ad image here sorry it is an amazon page but the picture is exactly this item so basically one of those old belt massage units
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks dave i didnt think about zooming into the name badge lessons learned solved guess its missing a canvas waist belt and motor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are called the brushes they should all be replaced at the same time typically
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is correct

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is about x inches and appears to be ceramic of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is an element of an old gas heater
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id guess the clear part is to keep it clean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eyeglass cleaners the clear part stops crud from getting into the pads you slip the lens between the pads and pinch them together while scrubbing to get dirt and debris off your glasses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,on the lid of your object are of the buddhist treasures chakra flaming wheel is the wheel of life signifying infinite change the endless knot is a symbol of eternity longevity and abundance the lotus flower symbolizes purity and fertility the double fish symbolizes happiness in marriage i assume the other four treasures are on the bottom half of the object
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiashtamangala a common buddhist decorative theme the fishes lotus endless knot and wheel ill bet the four other symbols are on the body of the pot this is or was the lid to also that knot is hilariously wonky

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a boiler
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not in the us is a huge place can you narrow it down at all looks like something steam powered though thats the innards of the boiler that you can see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,boiler of a possibly stationary steam engine you can see the firebox steam dome heating tubes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a steam boiler looks like either a steam tractor or truckcar of some sort could also just have been mounted on a cart that could be pulled around by horses or draft animals in which case it probably had a flywheel that ran external machinery
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the remains of a steam tractor the rear axle and final drive is gone all i see in your very nice photos are the boiler engine and front axle httpsenwikipediaorgwikisteamtractor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a friend down in mexico snapped these pictures and shared them with me he said he thought it was some kind of cannon or gun from the revolution era but then again it is found in or near farmland any ideas of how it could have been used does it have any value besides scrap metal should he recover it are there any pictures of a similar item maybe complete anywhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can also see the wheels and axlesit was definitely mobile

whatisthisthing,not_removed,japanese sen coin sens are no longer in circulation when they were sen yen and pretty much every shot is upside down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what exactly about the coin is weird can you be more specific
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks alot im sorry they were upside down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i shouldnt of used the word weird its just foreign
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heres your coin showa era year which means
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah in that case it might not even be foreign it just uses written language you do not understand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,doesnt that mean foreign
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no httpwwwdictionarycombrowseforeign first we do do not know which country op is in or from in the matter of establishing a nonforeign baseline second an artifact might be constructed in ops country wherever their nonforeign baseline is that contains language that op cannot recognize or understand what we can infer is that op does not understand that language on the coin they might be born in and sitting in japan unlikely without speaking japanese in which case the coin is not foreign to op at all each language did come from some place and they are often associated with such places but many places have multiple languages and many languages have multiple places where they are important there are many problems with conflating the fact that you do not understand a language with it being foreign this is related to the problem with labelling languages with country flags foreign refers to countries or other specific regional entities
whatisthisthing,not_removed,strange or unfamiliar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im from the us it is a japanese sen which means the coin would be foreign
whatisthisthing,not_removed,all of which was unknown at the time of query by me the second part by you also
whatisthisthing,not_removed,true if i included i was from the us we wouldnt be having this problem
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no problem precise questions are more likely to get the right answer than vague questions i was trying to home in on the actual question so as to ensure the right answer for you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for trying to find it i appreciate it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,google actually finds it pretty easily but i only just checked for that google image search for shows it after a page or so of hits when i first saw it i thought it might be a coin from japan but got distracted with other witt posts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your post has been removed as it does not contain an image or description please try reposting and including a link to an image or a description of what you are asking about

whatisthisthing,not_removed,goofy as a greek athlete goophyseus this page is in italian and german sorry disney comic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not sure if its visible but the first word appears to be goophysseuss if im reading that right under that it says gooh where the word gooh or gooph is in cursive and underlined then there are numbers and underneath that and then theres just a zigzag line
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the metal thingy is called a tremolo block these are usually better finished andor forged this one looks like a billet tone block that someone either bought aftermarket or hand made chances are it was sitting on a desk for some time and someone was bored and started scratching the name of some failed band heshe was in at the time on it really dont feel its of any significance that tremolo block should have better tone than most you will find though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its called a sustain block its mass makes up for the strings not being attached to the body of the guitar when you have a tremolowhammy bar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats interesting i think i read that one particular comic albeit in serbian language when i was a kid i guess that was a persons nickname or something im marking it as solved because theres not much we can find out from just a couple of lines of words and numbers thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can tell you that if that block of wood was just wedged between the bridge and the body of the guitar its not really a part of the guitar and just a piece of scrap wood a previous owner used to make it a fixed bridge guitar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,til thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not wooden its made out of a metallic alloy because the object is quite heavy and the letters are etched in it somebody this person who calls themselves goofy probably scratched it with a screw or something in i guess the object is connected to the bridge and there are strings attached to it httpsiimgurcomzxqpfyhjpg is how the underside of the guitar looks like with the thingy and the strings inside the body of the guitar a closeup of the metal thingy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dual axis slewing drives are generally used on satellite dishes and for solar panel tracking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mayhaps ask the seller on ebay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i may be wrong but that looks like part of a rack and pinion system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i put it on ebay for the link since i dont have a hosting acct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats hilarious i think this is the first time ive seen anyone use ebay as an image host but reddit now lets you upload pics through the site directly so you should do that next time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not a frog expert but when we caught these as kids we were told they were leopard frogs possibly httpsenwikipediaorgwikinorthernleopardfrog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep i have owned these little guys for years i was coming here to say this exact thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks we were told he was a leopard frog but couldnt tell what kind were torn between lowland plains and southern leopard frogs at the moment anyone know of a way to discern further
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he looks like the ones we have here ours are northern leopard frogs i am in alberta canada
whatisthisthing,not_removed,such fabulous words russet dorsolateral ridges thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,antique candle snuffer scissors found pic similar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is right i had an argument over one of these with my grade history teacher
whatisthisthing,not_removed,story time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no thats kindergarten
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post for translations please try rtranslator or rtranslation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it similar to brick but much less dense to me it looks like a fire brick like theyd use to line the walls of a kiln or support something large inside a kiln
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this looks like a ceramic packing for separation or absorption columns in chemical or petrochemical industry the columns are filled with a large number of these they enhance and expand the surface of contact between a fluid and a gas packings comes in many different styles and sizes ceramic ones are often used when the fluid or the gas is chemically agressive like an acid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks almost like some kind of filter media exceptbig
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some kind of ceramic insulator like these httpwwwsrishticeramicscomceramicinsulatorbeadshtm
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like kiln furniture that a glass artist would use to elevate or slump a piece of glass in an electric kiln they can be blocks or columns in a variety of sizes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a type of possibly from a septic tank certainly an object designed to maximise surface area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,plausible it was my first thought too but httpwwwaxnercomkilnpostsandhardbricksoapsaspx are usually simpler in shape im leaning toward texaspops answer of this looks like a ceramic packing for separation or absorption columns in chemical or petrochemical industry they enhance and expand the surface of contact between a fluid and a gas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can confirm i worked with packed bed absorption columns and the ceramic packing looked very similar to this source engineer working in the oil and gas industry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so the box is a fiberglass hand hole theyre used as underground access points for everything from water to fiber optic cables the rest looks like lp regulators which means theres an underground lp tank below it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,green thing looks like a pressure regulator gas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im going to toss my hat in the its the top of a buried propane tank ring im guessing the field is near a building you might be able to see the piping coming up and heading into the building
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is there a water tank nearby
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres a propane tank underground the piece on the bottom is a gas regulator to adjust pressure the part on top has two pieces yellow caps to connect gas lines to and the part with the black cap is for someone to refill the tank the red piece with the wire going to it is a gas meter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is indeed an underground propane tank red regulator is stage green is second stage to take to of pressure the green one really shouldnt be installed in the dome like that it should be up by the house
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok a little more in depth big yellow cap is where gas is put into tank small yellow cap is used when the tank has to be evacuated of its gas called vapor return black cap on the cluster valve is the relief valve do not put your face over it middle is the gauge to tell you how much gas is in the tank red regulator takes pressure from over psi down to psi green to inc of water column which is about half pound of pressure i do see a dielectric union after the green regulator so that means they have cathodic protection on the tank which is good thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mark it solved it is indeed an underground propane or butane tank
whatisthisthing,not_removed,til thanks for the knowledge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe is some kind of water pump you said it is in a field so maybe it has something to do with the irrigation system
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i had one of these on a property i stayed on see that little metal piece under water to the left the green thing you would use a long metal pole to turn it to turn water on to the property looks like an access point turn water to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the red regulator is your first stage lp regulator the green is your second stage lp regulator there is also a gauge in between the yellow caps so the propane provider can check tank percentage and thus know when to stop filling propane providers often bury tanks where it is extremely cold in the winter to keep the gas from freezing as most propane isnt pure but a blend of other gases as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be natural gas well that pumps into a storage tank to wait for pickup
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre correct propane regulators
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes it is near a building but i am not sure where or if it goes into the building
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also know that you should have that after dinner cigar elsewherefar elsewhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah those are gas thingies not water thingies source used to work with water thingies stayed the hell away from gas thingies and electric thingies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree it looks like a smaller version of my sprinkler system main box
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we dont depend on the gauge when filling we use the bleeder valve that you see sticking from the side just under that bigger yellow cap when it spits liquid we stop filling you can only fill to and propane will not completely freeze over unless the temps get below degrees that is propanes boiling point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not that the propane freezes but that its vapor pressure goes low doesnt take too much pressure loss before it wont flow through the regulators
whatisthisthing,not_removed,natural gas doesnt work that way
whatisthisthing,not_removed,natural gas takes too much pressure to compress like propane so it needs massive storage facilities such as httpsenwikipediaorgwikigasholder to hold it in gaseous form anything with relatively small tanks and high pressure regulators is going to be propane
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is not s sprinkler valve box
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that green thing is a gas regulator source do cng fueling for a living
whatisthisthing,not_removed,regular hank hill here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup depends on the load put on the tank and vaporization rate of the tank
whatisthisthing,not_removed,instead of spouting off contradictory information with no backgroind you should consider offering an explanation so the ones who read your comment get more informed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup for years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dang i guess i pushed your button natural gas is methane which boils at degrees centigrade roughly to keep that a liquid at all that temperatures you have to have tanks that are strong enough to survive to atmospheres of pressure and from the experiment that we are doing earlier thats going to involve about tonnes of pressure on every square metre of that tank so its going to have to be made up incredibly strong steel its going to be very heavy it just makes it expensive and impractical to carry around httpswwwthenakedscientistscomarticlesquestionswhystorepropanenotnaturalgas natural gas has to be stored either in huge volume spaces like salt caverns or liquefied and stored in super insulated thermos bottle type tanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,used in the century to help clean grain

whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay so the few things i know about this paddle is that my father had it since he was a teen so it at least has to be from the its from butterfly and the signature on the back is that of a famous player back in the day but what i want to know is the exact model and such if they recorded those things back in the day is it vintage sought after thanks in advance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your post has been removed because you know what the thing is please try rhelpmefind if you want to find more of the item or rwhatsthisworth if you are looking for the value you might also try rtabletennis good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah thats what i could find as well i want to know more though like if it was mass produced or like i said vintage and that sort thanks anyway though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah yours is definately in better shape than this i mean you could try making a post on that forum to try and get their opinion as they are collectorsbest of luck but someone on that forum mentioned one in mint condition could fetch dollars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heh i have no intention of selling it but ill give it a shot thanks

whatisthisthing,not_removed,in outlets they use plastic or fiber washers which are pressed on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bless you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks like a cross standard pen refill note that the refill standard specifies the shape of the refill the way it writes depends upon the ink type and roller manufacturer the overall weight and heft of the pen should be unchanged
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the coupler ring or slip nut usually comes with the trap it should thread onto the adjoining pipe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its called a slip nut there is also a slip nut washer that goes on inexpensive part bring the old to the hardware store with you good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hey guys broke this plumbing piece looks like a coupler between the trap of my sink and the outgoing pipe but i cant find it not sure if i have the name right its inches in diameter inch in height the outgoing pipe has male threads that this one fit onto and it seemed to just slide or click onto the trap pipe any help is greatly appreciated thanks in advance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks so much

whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it the sound at the beginning of if so its a pretty common industrial music technique it could be a synth or it could just be a lifted sample from something else
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do those sounds have specific names
whatisthisthing,not_removed,regarding synthesizers no they do not synth sounds are a collection of settings for various oscillator envelope cutoffs and complicated math stuff regarding samples yes they often do but that whole world is huge and beyond my realm of knowledge long story short those sort of sounds are decades old if you listen to stuff like nin pretty hate machine youll hear very similar themes that get reinforced through their entire catalog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for shame it seems like i have to figure out how to make it myself with a synthesizer then
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mean to point you in the right direction start with something like a sawwave then send it through overdrive and distortion filters maybe beef it up with some chorus and reverb alternatively you can start with an electric guitar and send it through a multieffects pedalamp doing similar stuff

whatisthisthing,not_removed,a bit of plastic off of some machinery on the production line contact the manufacturer with the lot number printed on the packaging theyll want to know companies take food contaminants seriously and if there is a broken machine shedding bits they want to know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a couple ideas glue used in the container it might have built upover time on the nozzle of the machine or whatever and finally fell off into the container you happened to buy plausible i think maybe its sugar not plastic if you dont add butter to melted sugar it turns rock hard and takes on a golden hue similar to whats in the picture if its sugar itll melt fairly quickly and spread out like syrup i think this is a also plausible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,plus youll probably get some coupons for free ice cream
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i called them and theyll be sending an envelope for the contaminant
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i came here to say this they will absolutely value that information they would also give out a compensatory voucher or several in all likelyhood
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it hasnt melted yet i ran it under hot water and nothing it scared me since i didnt expect to bite down on something hard also it has a shape to it like it has been melted and put into a mold

whatisthisthing,not_removed,the crater is south east of dexter nm it looks to be about feet across all i can figure is an underground explosion happened at one time link with all photos because im a noob at this lol httpimgurcomayuqde
whatisthisthing,not_removed,check out the strange shaped feature in google satellite view about miles west of sitka alaska seems to be a depression with a raised center in the alluvial sediment flow easy to see in the bathometric image looks like a an astroid impact with the sea surface and the shock wave going straight thru the ocean formed it imagine the size of the splash from the entry imagine the size of the surface waves imagine the size of the sub sea tsunami spreading from the column of water being pushed down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe from when they tested the nuclear bombs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just a guess here but i have seen on tv where a lake will suddenly disappear down into a sinkhole when an underground cave collapses theres one in africa that is called the bottomless lake i saw it on expedition unknown on the travel channel

whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks that seems most likely to be it solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would be the piece in the middle of the belt buckle known as the prong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it almost looks like a hinge spring has broke apart do the pieces fit together near the looped end
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is what it looks like but thats an odd thing to find of in a washing machine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i believe this is correct however keep in mind those buckles arent just found on belts could be from a purse harness jacket or some other item that had six of them and wasnt machine washable or someone works at a belt factory and had them in their pants pocket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,perhaps someone owns a bustier or other garment with lots of buckles it isnt machine washable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,other post with picture of other side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rwhatsthisworth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im not asking if it a coin i want to know the maker and if it is worth anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you mention printer related which brings to mind things like a httpswwwgooglecomsearchqvelobindremovaltool although it has a larger handle and a more defined channel for following the binding it does look like its meant to scrape off anything projecting from a flat surface
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess is its some kind of inexpensive finger plane
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its about long wide and has an wide blade
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like for some sort of hand planer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when moved across a surface does the blade contact the surface and remove material it looks like the blade is set up from the feet a bit if it doesnt remove material its not a plane although it definitely looks like one it also definitely looks like its meant to be a hand tool what makes you think its printer related
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like it may be a part of a pill cutter but most look more like so probably not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think you are on the right track the shape does fit nicely in between my fingers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hard to tell from the photos but the blade looks very shallow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the blade rides about above the bottom surface however it will shave material off if its running within the groove between those feet just a hunch on the printer relation could be totally wrong here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rwhatsthisbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwhxcircuitscomabouthtml is the company that made the board they made it for which is a japanese beauty company why they made it i have no freaken clue edit whx was started in so the board has to be quite new
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if this board is just one sided and the other side does not have pads then this is a very very badly designed led driver board if there are pads on the backside it is a just badly designed led driver board top left is a switching constant current supply controller buck topology for whatever reason the inductor is on the bottom left the entire right side is a string of leds in series
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a board for a quack medical device or a uv fingernail polish hardener the pads on the right are most likely for leds their site has something about light therapy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a printed circuit board without the components ie a part off of the manufacturing line that never got finished when finished there would be parts stuck to the little gold pads maybe there was a problem with the boards or parts left over at the end of a production run and they got thrown away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the board is preuse so the only way you could have come across this is if the boards were traveling and literally fell off a truck or if maybe one was lost and found its way into the packaging of another product one your parents bought most electronics are made in china these days and this board was made in shenzen so it makes sense so what the heck does it do here is my thought the board layout shows a dc port spot so it was meant to be plugged in the big square on the bottom is probably some sort of cpu or logic chip the identical spots probably go to identical sensors or motors of some kind i bet that the board goes to something like it plugs in and probably has or so sensors for the photon sensors the secondary board might even be for those leds in the head what a journey we have been on tonight ukingpaixo enjoy your someassemblyrequired facehealing wand
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the big square on the bottom is probably some sort of cpu or logic chip yeah a twopin cpu in a spot marked its an inductor the identical spots probably go to identical sensors or motors of some kind leds each marked with a d the board is a led driver for leds minus all the components
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like you can we be friends

whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a stamp for make up powders makes the pallet look like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a tool for for repressing powder makeup into the container maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its steel with a rounded bottom with a hard black piece attached to it the bottom of the black piece resembles a meat tenderizer the black piece cannot be detached from the steel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this might be it we sell a cheap barware set that comes with a drink muddler which would make sense why their were no brand markings on it the muddler may have come loose from the set and tossed in their box by accident i will investigate tomorrow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,something similar was posted a few days ago and that seems to be the consensus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this makes sense i just cant find a similar image on google anywhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a powder packer for when its still damp from rubbing alcohol used to rebind powder makeup after its began to break apart crumble
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im pretty certain that it is i bought my boyfriend a similar one last year
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks kinda like a shotgun reloading press for rebuilding diy ammo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be a vintage draw press to make cans you start with a flat disk and keep working it around the press to make the walls thinner and longer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its for brass shotgun shells its missing parts sadly its only good as an antique as the metal is pitted basically for ramming the wad home
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my guess is that its a pill press but thats only a guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my assumptions handle is used for pressing with a big force numbers on the side and pictures hint to holes of different sizes in the bottom disc the bottom disc can turn i assume this because there is a screw to lock this disc it shold be mounted on a work bench spaces for screws in the bottom plate different discs can be placed in the press the three things should probably be used to lock in the two plates in correct position in the press i dont know if the holes in the bottom disc go all the way true so i dont know whether it is the goal to push through the hole of press something in the hole a guess is that you should pick a size of hole to use instead of using them all at once
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like my dads ring resizer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,every plughole has a different size and the crank is used for pressing with a big force i assume
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you put a sheet of metal between the press i think it would press with all or some pins instead of just one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,video is awesome but it doesnt show the press
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it seems unlikely such a big heavy crank is that the right word for a single pill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,each hole would be for a different gauge shot gun shell if you can measure the diameter of the holes it would help to my theory
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree i just mean you would slide a small disk under pin the move to the next one after then the next and so on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats true
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was going to say some kind of casing reloader but this is probably right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they appear to be screw together elements of a tuned dipole antenna for the stoddart receiver there is a picture of the radio and its accessories on httponlinesfsueduhlsrchtml page its near the bottom of the page in a line art drawing but it fits what you have in your case each setup starts with the two short elements that have the jack style ends then the colored groups are screwed together and attached to this ends to give a dipole antenna for whatever the wavelengths are specified
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some extra pictures below it has a sticker on the box labelled stoddart aircraft co httpimgurcomkzhjowc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the guys over in ramateurradio might find that interesting and may be interested in buying it if you wanted to sell just a guess though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the symbol makes me think of a propane or natural gas company i didnt see any with initials ie but i didnt look too hard might want to check local phone book
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this could be promising e could stand for energy pretty common in gas company names

whatisthisthing,not_removed,how can they enforce a law that is illegal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they simply issue tickets to mainly tourists and hope they pay instead of taking it to court
whatisthisthing,not_removed,removed as a duplicate post of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a sauce spoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as mentioned its a sauce spoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have found two possibilities worth considering the first is that it could be used for serving saucescreams etc the second is that it is intended for a child to use removing the need to turn the spoon to face you they dont seem very common at all but a few antique pages have them for sale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just asked my godmother who actually owns the spoon and she said it was a baby spoon im really not sure but it looks a little too small to be a sauce spoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it would hold an egg perfectly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably used for scooping sugar or other things of that nature
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the baby spoon idea is it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is no spoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,please respond to suggestions made and if appropriate mark the post solved httpwwwredditcomrwhatisthisthingwikimarkapostnocss if you have any bother doing so reply to me and ill mark the post solved for you also please do not delete your post as other people might find it useful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is no spoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be a sauce spoon you stand on the side of the baby and pour it into the mouth its a weird description but im pretty sure this is right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no depending on the year sugar spoons are either very small or tongs for cubed sugar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a hydroponic marajuana grow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely to grow something my guess like caskey is marijuana or possibly mushrooms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i thought but its way too out in the open for that there was a sign saying what company it was with but i checked that last night and dont remember but ill get a picture of the company it was like dynamic defense holdings inc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,see my reply to the other guy i dont think its a grow op based on how obvious it is and its location
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah mushrooms are grown in the dark
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dynamic defense holdings is this in a fairly vacant mall is it possible someone is renting this out to use as a set for a low budget tv show or indie film maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah while led grow lights give off purple hue thats not a growop setup youd want a more controlled environment than that plus those weird cylinders arent large enough for a plant to grow reasonably
whatisthisthing,not_removed,some mushrooms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes and these might be lamps that dont disturb the fungus or for workers to inspect and pick them without causing much damage
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive taken some more pictures that ill upload to an album soon for more context i could see that but it would be verrryy low budget
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well the blue and purple lights are what are used to grow plants in hydro they emit pinpoint spots on the uv spectrum dont think that would work for shrooms
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are crinoid stem fossils
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep these are crinoidal fossils maybe in limestone i havnt studied geology in a while but yes definitely crinoids heres an image with loads in it basically the crinoids die fall to the surface of the ocean and become fossilised
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its segmentsossicles of httpwwwucmpberkeleyeduechinodermatacrinoideahtml stems in a httpsenwikipediaorgwikidunhamclassificationdunhamclasses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is one beautiful rock i love crinoid fossils
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i love how it is just a few bold colours away from being a cool print
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know this is a rock but are those fossils in it it seems odd that they have such jagged edges and theres so many it makes me question if this may be something manmade httpimgurcomjwbzzjn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oooh thats a beauty multiple crinoid stems in a limestone matrix want
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fossil crinoids i have a couple of those theyre so pretty the ones i have are pentacrinites dichotomus i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is one of the coolest things ive ever seen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like they sell anywhere from up to dollars on ebay at a quick glance but the average seems to be dollars value on average
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a nice one how big is it do you have a nana for scale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know this has been answered but rfossilid is a good place for these specific inquiries
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure is beautiful i wonder how it would look after a polish job

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its clearly an ancient bagel
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they look like really large httpsenwikipediaorgwikidiatom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how far inland did you find this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it almost looks manmade as the lighter colored facets seems to be sections of a part that was threaded the way a bolt has threads this is a strange one id like a proper explanation from a geologist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a stone maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,til what a crinoid is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,basically the crinoids die fall to the surface of the ocean the surface that is at the bottom though not the one at the top
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved looks like everyone agrees that these are crinoid stem fossils thank you everyone for your help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks like fossilized headcheese
whatisthisthing,not_removed,minerals marie
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the jagged edges are the sides of the lumenaxial canal of the animal which carried nerves along the length of the stem the reason they appear jagged is that the stem is made up of many stacked plates ossicles the edges are the facets where the plates are in contact edit to add these things were echinoderms related to sea stars urchins and such echinoderm exoskeletons are comprised of many hundredsthousands of small plates often entire limestones will be composed of the disarticulated remains of crinoids but finding complete specimens is very rare and prized by collectors and researchers as the ligaments that hold the plates together decay after death with the plates scattering about the seafloor hence what we have here edit ll see linked image for a really nice polished slab showing stem and other skeletal segments edit lll a few nearly complete ordovician crinoid specimens that i have found juvenile and adult httpimgurcomzyfebmu
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a rock mainly made up of crinoid stems see
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i know this is solved but may i ask for the area that you found this i mean geographic region
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ha this went over my head i thought a grandma for scale thats weird then i though hmmm a measurement i am unfamiliar with specific to rocks very possible then i got it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a quarter for scale httpmimgurcomjwbzzjn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i found it on a hiking trail in eastern kentucky

whatisthisthing,not_removed,til what a crinoid is httpsenwikipediaorgwikicrinoid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,til theyre not extinct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you ever played gen of pokemon theres thats how i first learned about extinct crinoids
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so not the water surface but the surface of the sea floor i guess it would be weird if they fell to the surface of the water or fell below the surface of the sea floor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pro tips only found in reddit comments
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes the ocean floor i should have said
whatisthisthing,not_removed,finding fossils is one of the most exciting things congrats on the find
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think you are pretty lucky thats an amazing stone with nice natural crosssections congrats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mmm brains
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where does one find these things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might know this many years ago i was viewing the collection of a fossil dealer he also did anthro stuff probably got it from graverobbers in central america so i have little doubt the fossils were possibly illegally collected as well and he had a crinoid the likes of which i have never seen since specifically the segments were tetrahedrons i was told they were presumably from particularly highenergy environments and would articulate more readily than the discsegmented ones ever seen one of these were they a specific genus of crinoid or was it polyphyletic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,echinoderm exoskeletons googled this and inadvertantly found out that starfish has gonads
whatisthisthing,not_removed,defining what is or isnt a fossil is subjective but any object made by man would be an artifact not fossil
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my grandfather was not a monkey oh yeah then why did he fall in love with a nana checkmate creationists
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are not the same as the fossils but certainly related here is a as a complete crinoid is very very rare
whatisthisthing,not_removed,heres a stalked crinoid walking httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvczcombnnkxg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my cat would love to meet that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes lileep my favorite fossil i just thought it was based on sea anemones
whatisthisthing,not_removed,make sure to give them to your local owl
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i found while hiking on a trail in kentucky but ive never found another like it so i dont know if that helps much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres large swaths of the coast ranges in california that have these kinds of rocks exposed everywhere the limestone is made almost entirely of conglomerated shellfish remains since most of the west coast was under the ocean for millions of years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a lot of luck but one needs to understand the lithology of the rock unit to determine the depositional environment and paleoecology in which the animals lived and a lot of luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,stream beds in middle tennessee
whatisthisthing,not_removed,segments were tetrahedrons similar to this httpwwwordovicianatlasorgatlasechinodermatacrinoideamonobathridaglyptocrinidaepycnocrinus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what about a human body found million years from now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,of course its not the same those species are long since extinct but the feather star is still a crinoid there are also today which are much closer in appearance to those in the fossil but those mostly live in very deep waters and there arent nearly as impressive videos of them

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like the style part but this doesnt sound correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lake cumberland or somewhere in the southern part of the state the ones i linked above are from central kentucky
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty awesome to think the area you hiked was once deep underwater
whatisthisthing,not_removed,always makes you wonder how it or others got there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats pretty cool to think about thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the response
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess the running water exposes them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres homo sapiens fossils out there already and would presumably be a fair few more in million years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you people are the exact reason i spend too much damn time on this website
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i remember when i learned that these still exist i might as well have been told that they found a triceratops living in madagascar all the books i read as a kid said that crinoids were long extinct im not sure if this is a case of numerous science books repeating and publishing bad science information or if living crinoids are a relatively new discovery like the coelocanth or if they merely realized that these other animals they already knew about were the same as the fossil crinoids or what either way it makes me hope that some day well find trilobites on the deep sea floor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is that shop called looks like a fun one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,jesus christ marie theyre minerals
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a rock shop til this exists
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpswwwfreeonlinemirrorcomimgmirrorjpg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,buoyancy is just water falling better than the buoyant object is falling
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably around red river gorge in eastern kentucky i dont remember exactly where but thats where we go the most
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it would be because that part of north america was under an ocean at the time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,right it makes for interesting hikes there are a lot of them that are separate and not in an amalgam like op found i always pick up a few
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive been looking for a half hour now and simply cant find a source but i recall reading once that the first living crinoids were discovered in the not long after deepwater trawling became possible its possible though that like you said they were believed to be something else at the time most likely some sort of starfish since the stalkless species are still commonly known as feather stars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,correct me if i am wrong but i believe this is the shop located inside pike place on the very bottom floor right next door to pipe palace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn it hank theyre fossils
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt see my reflection am i a vampire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sigh i dont know why i clicked this take my upvote
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking that it looked pretty typical of the ft payne formation mississippianlower carboniferous that is found throughout southern ky but other mississippian units borden fm and newman fm deposited contemporaneously with the ft payne are found in the lower elevations of the gorge along the streams and river and at the base of the cliffs pretty sure that is what you have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,interesting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,growing up in kansas we would go out and hunt for arrowheads and shark teethwild huh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you mean one fossil per rock
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exactly cant remember the name of it though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah okay will have to check it out youre probably right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i can see your reflection it looks like are you a vampire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,used to see them all the time back home i grew up in the suburbs of kansas city saw them on the ks and mo side
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are separate from any other rocks independent as it were so when you look at the stream bed or the embankment the gravel is light colored pick up a handful and start sorting through and you find those little guys cylinders about one to two cm long
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gem heaven i always visit when i go to pike place now i know the name httpsmyelpcombizgemheavenseattle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,til im a vampire
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that would be really cool makes you wonder how long they have been sitting there thanks for the input and enjoy your hikes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a chop mark check the fat here httpswwwredditcomrwhatisthisthingwikifatwikichopmarks or this post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it worth anything
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just a stamp on a bill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,aw man thanks for the info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think hes wearing a titanium necklace baseball players are weird httpwwwphitenusacomnecklaces more this model httpwwwphitenusacommirrortitaniumnecklace
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cant tell from the gif but its probably a phiten we use to wear them all the time very popular for baseball players
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really hard to tell but love me some muni what a great guy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can confirm played baseball in college and wore a phiten necklace it wasnt so much that i thought it did anything it was just that i and all the other players were so superstitious that if i took it off i knew id to badly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah this and power balance bands are probably too of the most gimmicky things that a lot of my buddies just had to have to improve their game
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you got addicted to the superstition haha
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no idea i think this company has the stranglehold on the titanium necklace market japanese made though edit heres a cheaper version
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wien is vienna in german scwhanhausser may be a company based in vienna what are the objects dimensions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like the door for a woodburning stove perhaps a radiatorheatingoven
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that could help httpfrankenwikideindexphpschwanstabilo its german though but i dont have the time to translate it right now sorry maybe someone else will
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try googling union suit short sleeve underwear also called combinations or short johns
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks ive tried several different combos of underwearboxershirt now i got a name actually call it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is an early chain drive speedster no real idea on the manufacturer though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is getting close at least but a few details dont look right to me american lafrance speedster
whatisthisthing,not_removed,many cars way back then were coach built meaning that the manufacturer supplied a rolling chassis and engine and the body work was custom built to the buyers specifications by a separate company i think the body work here is likely to be a oneoff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why doesnt the solved flair have an exclamation mark
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you its a start
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats pretty close and as i understand it early autos were very customizable the automakers would often just sell a platform and different coach makers would then supply the body and those would often be further modified by the owner im not marking it yet as id like some more input but this is some good work
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was thinking much the same thing but entertained the possibility that this might be a known maker there were so many coach makers in that era and a few of them were historically significant i thought id see if this one rang any bells
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just looked through solved posts and i think it puts an exclamation point if you simply comment solved to change the flair i actually used the flair button so i think that was the difference
whatisthisthing,not_removed,details on the wheels are one difference that i think may be very important that is something that probably would not have been customized in those days there are at least as many differences as there are similarities when you closely examine both but yeah its a start good luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is called httpsenwikipediaorgwikibindle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,always thought its called a knapsack but apparently im wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i call them hobo bags but apparently that name is for another bag that got its name from a bindle on a stick aka hobo bag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the stick is called a stick the bindle is called a bindle together they are a stick and bindle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,baluchon nvm brain was set in wrong language
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it was called a knapsack but apparently a hobo bag is just a bindles knapsack and definitely isnt the hobo bags backpack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,who put beans in my bindle edit bundle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a runaway sack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a swag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what an interesting question
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my life savings
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a bindle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a bindle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a related concept shows up in the popular australian song the protagonist a wandering swagman carries around all of his possessions wrapped up in a blanket his swag he lovingly names his swag matilda whence the songs title
whatisthisthing,not_removed,which is when a hobo homeless person ties his belongings up in a cloth and ties it to a stick for transportation
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i only know this because of portal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i always thought it was a bindlestiff but apparently thats another term for a hobo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow ive probably seen that thing in a thousand cartoons but never placed a name to it til
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought knapsack was synonymous with backpack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought a knapsack is when its just the fabric part and not the stick but apparently it actually is just another word for backpack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwiktionaryorgwikiknapzaklowgerman
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i couldve sworn it was a knapsack only recently found out i was wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it was a rucksack never heard of bindle before
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the dutch word for it is knapzak i didnt know the translation to english but i like it better than bindle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like hobo bag better anyway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we said hobo stick in louisiana
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hobo sack in my area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bindlestaff and bindle in a pinch you could toss the bindle and use the bindlestaff to defend yourself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in mexico we used to call them tambaches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont worry im not a stabbin hobo im a singin hobo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so pengu has swag for days
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that really sheds some light on tom trauberts blues by tom waits
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he lovingly names his swag matilda whence the songs title um no the phrase waltzing matilda was a slang expression which originated from german immigrants waltzing came from walz gehen which literally means go rolling or to travel or roam matilda came from mathilda which was a slangterm that german journeymen would use to refer to their toolroll when he sings wholl come a waltzing matilda with me hes asking who will accompany him in his wanderings with only a swag for possessions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,andy and the other swagmen didnt carry it on a stick though it was strapped to their backs or over the shoulders
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i was always told i was waltzing matilda because you couldnt move your arms and legs very well when in the old irons they used to make and the hobbling resembled the limited movement of a waltz the song has a totally different meaning when waltzing is a swag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also mentioned in the irish folk song rocky road to dublin in dublin next arrived i thought it such a pity to be soon deprived a view of that fine city so then i took a stroll all among the quality me bundle it was stole all in a neat locality something crossed me mind when i looked behind no bundle could i find upon me stick a wobblin enquiring for the rogue they said me connaught brogue wasnt much in vogue on the rocky road to dublin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,though hobo isnt quite synonymous with homeless
whatisthisthing,not_removed,exactly always been my favorite way to transport my possessions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,simpsons for me man that tramps got the energy of a hobo yeah he never stops punching except to check out his
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a bindlestiff is a thief ie someone who would steal a bindle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know if we are wrong maybe its a regional thing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,texan here seconding you sentiments perhaps it regional
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i am texan and i thought a rucksack didnt have a stick like santa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah from douwe dabbert
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a hobo sack definitely definitely a hobo sack
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nothing beats the hobo life stabbing folks with my hobo knife
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is also the train of thought that in reference tom trauberts blues the waltzing matilda is a reference to heroin addiction though tom himself say that waltzing matilda is when youre on the road youre not with your girlfriend youre on the bum edittoms quote
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tom trauberts blues its the same song as waltzing matilda
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre correct of course the term waltzing matilda antedates the song the historys a bit diluted but the best i can do is on the history of the song which was still almost years old at that point the author asserts that its a qld regional term for humpin the bluey meaning the same
whatisthisthing,not_removed,iirc the stick is called a bindlestiff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because waltzing matilda was swagman slang for drifting brought he outback
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a bush ballad not a waltz
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought that was the stick the bindles carried by
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its absolutely a knapsack knapzak where im from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes thats how i think most dutch people know that word or read it in the donald duck magazine its just the kind of word they use
whatisthisthing,not_removed,swiggity swooty comin for that booty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,noop noop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not the same song it borrows the tune and the term but thats about where the parallels end
whatisthisthing,not_removed,whats your bean situation like
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no that is a bindlestaff
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i read that in a bill cosby voice and now feel dirty
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpnootnootnet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah youre right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,more like a ding
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah til
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is another semiformed egg you won the egg lottery edit just pick out the extra shell and enjoy the extra protein
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you should crosspost to rweirdeggs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,egg in an egg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chicken lay weird eggs from time to time as others said this was a malformed egg that ended up inside another egg shell thats really benign compared to the eggs you can find if you have live chickens if you get a lash egg youll swear off eggs for weeks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a soft shell caught inside also very stale
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there really is a subreddit for everything i am always amazed when i find those
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a bit scared to ask butlash eggs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just google lash egg gag
whatisthisthing,not_removed,really not the place
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rofcoursethatsathing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eggceptional every review
whatisthisthing,not_removed,eggs come from the chicken ovarysometimes chickens oviduct internal infections bad flesh and pus can end up in a shell sometimes the shells look close to normal sometimes the look like lumps of liver mixed with cheese if you buy store eggs youll never see them but if your great grandfather thought it was a good idea to have backyard chickens you may run into them from time to time and once you find one youll never crack an egg directly into a cake mix again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if the chicken gets inflammation in the oviduct they can occur its basically a lump of left over egg material puss etc not pleasant but nothing you would mistake for a normal egg and plan to eat
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if by puss you mean the yellow smelly infection liquid thats pus puss is something else entirely
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes i meant pus typo on my part
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an atheist symbol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the httpsenwikipediaorgwikianarchistsymbolism
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so i was watching the australian abcs documentary on the panama papers scandal and this is the tattoo on the arm of the guy under whose name mossac fonseca is registered
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its the symbol for atheism
whatisthisthing,not_removed,antifa
whatisthisthing,not_removed,isnt that the symbol for anarchists httpsenwikipediaorgwikianarchistsymbolism
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep you can see the curved leg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are callouses what line of work are you in they develop from gripping things repeatedly some people can develop them more easily and the cause may just be every day wear its just a thickening of the skin to prevent injury
whatisthisthing,not_removed,to add if you didnt get it from work i develop these from swinging on vinesropes or hanging on bars
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this explains it is there any way to prevent them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,stop swinging on vinesropes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,speaking from experience go slowly and dont try to remove the entire callus at once
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i do pull ups
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres gloves for pull ups apparently that could help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,chart recorder the red thing is a pen that draws a line on the paper my guess is it is being used to either record temperature or humidity the spool of paper will turn very slowly and the pen will leave a line based on the position of the arm it is mounted to there will be some type of indicator on the paper for datetime data type recorded
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also called a hygrothermograph when i worked in museums id frequently overhear patrons considering them like they were intentional art pieces people were always asking after the artists name or the date of the piece i never had the inclination to lie because the truth and further info about the fragility of old oil paintingscanvases was more interesting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably both looks like a dual pen recorder
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely this i just visited the chicago art institute and they had these spread out in various rooms i thought it was for earthquakes but when i asked the the security about it and she said it was to detect atmospheric changes that could affect the art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre right i didnt even notice the black one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what does the fitting look like is it for a coaxial cable could be for a movable bed like in a hospital
whatisthisthing,not_removed,time to bring out the screwdriver op
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought was that it might be a very basic coax mappertester numbered remote terminators would connect to the other end of your cables which youd connect to and press the button corresponding to the number at the other end of the cable under test leds would illuminate depending on whether you had continuity or an open this is a guess though i cant find an image of this particular one and given that it has no branding its hard to say
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the round can labeled is a mhz oscillator that frequency is used for lots of unlicensed remote controls this is probably used with an external antenna
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it looks like a mini coax connection
whatisthisthing,not_removed,added pics of the inside i tried googling the s but that got me nowhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a die mark to indicate when that batch of drip trays was created yours was created on the of june
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes but the left side is likely for the year so june
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a different form of httpswwwredditcomrwhatisthisthingwikifatwikiplasticmoldproductioncodes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah that makes more sense than day of the month good point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nice thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,shuttle for making hooked rugs out of yarn on a bulap or osnaburg base earliest ones date to but your design has been around since the early to the present
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you

whatisthisthing,not_removed,lamp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its a wall mount lamp missing the glass piece the inputs are likely the passageway to pass wires through for the bulb socket
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wall lamp missing its wiring
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks everyone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems to have audio inputs on two sides and a mount maybe some sort of phone thing never seen anything like it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its just a broken wall sconce lamp i believe what appear to be trs jacks are just a pipe conduit for the cord if you look at the bottom of most table lamps youd see something similar with a cord running out of it the keyhole shaped part on the bottom pic is where it would hang on a nail heres a similar sconce
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cheers thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive removed your post try rwhatsthisbug
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that link does not exist im afraid can you link a photo from elsewhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a figure from the garbage pail kids
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like he is holding a squirrel or maybe a basket with an animal in it theres also something around his neck and he is holding on to it i found this under a rock at the lake and it really intrigues me for some reason i know its probably a long shot but i was hoping someone might recognize it theres no writing on it anywhere
whatisthisthing,not_removed,x post to rstatuegropers i like the is this isthmus auto correct unless of course you know for a fact that the status is located on a httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofisthmuses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the style of clothing the statue is wearing makes me think that it is of a man from the probably a writer looks sort of similar to joseph smith founder of mormonism but i couldnt find a matching statue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its for a tivo to control your satellite or cable box the ir blasters would mount in front of your cable box edit it could be for something other than a tivo but thats just what i recognized it from could be for any pvr or slingbox type device to control another receiver
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these ir blasters are usually used when you want to mount all of your various equipment in a cabinet that may be in another room or simply out of sight youll have some sort of receiver that these plug into and is visible you mount these in front of your other equipment and they relay the signal from your one universal remote
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a penatrometer you would place a material sample under the pin and measure the time it takes to penetrate a set distance the heavier mass would be for tougher materials
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are there any graduated or measuring marks on shafts with the balls the ballsshaft remind me of hyrdrometer of sorts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does it spin almost looks like a broken solar system model
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op this is a pretty highly compressed image a lot of detail is lost could you raise the quality settings or find a better camera and take additional photos i presume there are not markings on the bottom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so the museum was able to get more information and its a van de graaf generator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,which parts can move can the main arm rotate on the central shaft it looks like the two balls on shafts can move up and down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this looks like it may some sort of bundling device like something to wind and compress wire or string onto a spindle assuming it rotates and the upper arm can be removed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is actually the right answer similar to a durometer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its hard to tell because of shadow but the heavier mass appears to have much less travel than i am used to seeing on a penetrometer further there do not appear to be any measurements or any place to attach missing pieces a penetrometer needs a mechanism to precisely measure the distance traveled im under the impression that you measure the time needed when measuring properties of fluids not when measuring any physical properties of solids that i can think of
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think thats unlikely as a large central sphere for the sun would have to be in the middle doesnt look like even a fixing for anything is there currently
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first though was lunar not solar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that wouldnt work though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant fathom what those balls would have to do with wrapping protrusions like that would fuck up tension pretty quick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think the dials are missing we used them to measure the strength of clay soils and asphalt mixtures
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i could only find an image but its a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you have to handle a lot of glassware and dont want to leave smudges i can sortof see where this might be useful sortof
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if youre inside the store why didnt you just ask an employee
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks like one of the most useless kitchen gadgets ever its a bit of silicone you can hold your lime with so you can squeeze it exactly the same as you always do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it to me solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good deduction that seems like what it is
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bizarre i guess if you have a lot of paper cuts this will protect your hands from stinging juice
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rtranslator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and also what does it say found outside my dorm room
whatisthisthing,not_removed,god now i really freely old nissan zx circa mid to late
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in all seriousnesslooks like a delorean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty sure this is from back when nissan was called datsun
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just bought a anniversary edition and im d
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in what way does a look at all like a delorean seriously i mean it has a black sunshade thing across the back window and it has wheels and looks somewhat sporty thats about the totality of the resemblance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think op has seen bttf enough times
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah right they were transitioning so they labeled many as
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont forget to get off our lawn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt say you are too young i said i felt old because that car was popular when i was in my formative teen years and now there are people who dont recognize it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i get that if you dont know you dont know the reaction youre getting is due to the fact that both the and the delorean are each iconic cars in their own right i wouldnt consider myself a car guy but it doesnt matter with either of these cars its not necessarily you they are reacting to but the fact this happens with all knowledge and its a shock when you realize the frame of reference you grew up with is now locked in time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a does not look like a delorean
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess while you claim to know shit about cars you obviously are not totally uninterested so httpsenwikipediaorgwikicarclassification is a nice wikipedia article to get you started it seems to me that to you any coupe built after the looks like a delorean well thats because its a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess youre right but the datsun is all about curves while the delorean is all about straight lines and corners
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just thought id let you know those things you called fanblades are called louvers for future reference
whatisthisthing,not_removed,try rskateboarding
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like what i had during the late early
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the extra holes someone drilled makes me think its an older deck someone tried to use modern trucks on but with the contestant barrage of retro stuff coming out i cant be sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good idea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe a damaged cannonball
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it would be pretty bad ass if it was a canon ball but just one that had been fired against something hard
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gate weight would have had a loop on flatter side hooked to a chain and the weight would close the gate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looked pretty closely and no mark indicating that there may have been a hook or anything attached looks pretty clear to me that the flat side is there for a reason not sure why maybe just designed to be the doorstop it is destined to be
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possible from a rock crusher mill
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks so much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might want to mark this as solved now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a book for the youth of germany at the time it shows songs and traditions for the seasons there are a bunch on google books you can use google translate to learn a bit more once you find the exact one that you have
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i googled a bit for buch sonnenlauf ii and the few results i got indicate that its just a collection of german songs it isnt anything particularly nazi and wasnt issued by the naziparty nsdap although being german folk songs some of the songs may have been sung in the nazi youth organizations fun fact the text written in a circle is httpsenwikipediaorgwikilowgerman a language spoken colloquially in northern germany
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this book is rare
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the lowgerman text transaltes to the wheel it rolls the wheel it rolls the life goes on but that is just the literal translation it rather means that the circle of seasons in a year rollsrepeats itself again and again therefore life goes its way that meaning goes hand in hand with the title of the book and its contents teaching kids seasons and traditions associated with those seasons

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a payroll check for william percy middleton he worked as a coal passer for that company for many years while he lived in williamsville before that hed been a farmer and a miller he was born in canada in and served in wwi he was moved to got married that year he died in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an old check and its already been paid in as to its worth as an artifact i couldnt say i doubt much
whatisthisthing,not_removed,seems like the ink should have run if it was found floating in a river and it is years old also the colors are very vibrant maybe its a reproduction of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the local historical society may like it for their archives
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that was a large amount of money for a payroll check in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats really awesome buffalo is my hometown so its even more awesome i wonder if he has relatives in the area
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres a little bit of a market for old checks its probably worth a buck or two
whatisthisthing,not_removed,may i ask where you found that information very interesting
whatisthisthing,not_removed,might be worth a lot to the descendants of w p middleton
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in is equivalent to today thats equal to per hour if its a biweekly paycheck and thats after deductions
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be anything not just a payroll check
whatisthisthing,not_removed,censuses city directories border crossing records military records edit id link but its behind a pay wall and a little annoying edit ah i linked a couple
whatisthisthing,not_removed,weekly check
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you color blind per chance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre pleasingly thorough
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how do you know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep i missed it still there is always someone in the company making the top pay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youre thoroughly pleasing

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a fish bone specifically one of the opercular gill plate bones likely from a carp
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like a scapula from a small animal but i cant seem to find any that look anywhere close to it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,view of the other side

whatisthisthing,not_removed,heres an example of

whatisthisthing,not_removed,polaris slingshot httpwwwpolariscomenusslingshot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,top tip if you search for what you are looking for you you might find it for example i thought about it for a few milliseconds and decided to use the google and search for images with the keywords the answer was literally first hit a clearly identified polaris slingshot the more you know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry i am new how do i mark solved on iphone with reddit app cant seems to find it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but if op googled instead of asking here i wouldnt have had the opportunity to learn what a polaris slingshot is the more you learn
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its ok i was passing and have marked it solved for you a single top level comment solved will do or you can use the flair link
whatisthisthing,not_removed,everybody who needs to know what a polaris slingshot is already does
whatisthisthing,not_removed,leather upper portion of the shoe leather lower portion and a rubber sole the top two symbols on the right are cow hides the bottom appears to be either a rubber or plastic maybe synthetic sheet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just to add to the above the other symbol used but not depicted here is for textile its a rough grid showing the weave
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the diamond just mean synthetic material but yeah its an indicator of materials
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep i realized that and was editing my original post while you posted that seems correct especially if you look at the actual sole looks synthetic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be a jackal maybe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how big was it location
whatisthisthing,not_removed,size and location would help
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably a lynx or more likely a bobcat mountain lions are only seen in the far north of wisconsin and rarely at that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the face is too stout for a racoon im thinking feline did you happen to get a photo of its other teeth theyd be more identifiable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a badger skull to me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure a dead one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mountain lion edit going on how wide the skull is compared to the face
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh wow i think youre right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont know what kind of animal it is but it looks like it spent time in darth vaders melted helmet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it was in wisconsin thought maybe a dog but the teeth are confusing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,kinda central wisconsin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and i didnt take it with me to measure but it was like a medium sized dog thought domestic cause it was found in an abandoned farmhouse
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely a feline im with franticbeans that more likely lynx seems too big for bobcat too gracile for mtn lion
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ye gods i hope so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is a top comment so who were you talking about
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fox maybe it looks similar to a gray fox skull edit on second thought to me it really looks more like a httpnaturalhistorysiedulewisandclarkimagesfsraccoonfrontjpg

whatisthisthing,not_removed,your post has been removed you want rwhatsthisbug

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it might be maratha from northern india but i couldnt find a close match
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have made two observations that may help your quest to decipher this coin the greek character psi is written in a calligraphic form and a few of the characters appear to be arabic so my bet is on cypriot arabic demotic or a form of coptic good luck

whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow that was fast thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like regular old copper to me id be careful sometimes cleaning things like this can destroy the value
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay guys i cleaned it up a bit and i love how it looks heres a before and after album
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you really do want it shiny again heres what i do for copper and brass that i want shiny mix cup of vinegar tsp salt and enough flour to make a paste then slather it all over the object wait a couple of minutes and its like new
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think that might be a sand embosser for public ash trays not an ashtray itself
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also should i be worried about the value its part of a vintage ashtray but i got it for just and i will be actually using it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how so
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah for copper a quick soak in a vinegar salt solution will do the trick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i want the rim and the monogram to be shiny but the background to be the same could i make the paste thick enough so it stays in those parts and it still be effective also does it matter what type of flour salt and vinegar i have apple cider vinegar all purpose flour and table salt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it would make the letter backwards if it was
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its part of the ashtray httpsimgurcomaoanzq
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would maybe show it to a local antiques dealer for an expert opinion on it but definitely dont attempt to clean it before you do just to be safe
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its harder to put old patina back on than it is to clean it off generally more people would like them with original patina than clean you can also damage the metal if its plated or just treated roughly if youre using it for yourself it doesnt much matter its also monogrammed and doesnt look of any particularly special make so you should be fine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its something ive heard about watching the antiques roadshow on daytime tv to be honest its to do with aging if you buy a bronze statue thats years old you dont want it to look brand new
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont want all of it shiny could i just wet a qtip with the solution and rub it on there a lot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,use some good masking tape to cover or mask thats where the name comes from the areas you dont want to clean instead of trying to mix a custom solution of vinegar and salt just use ketchupcatsup same chemicals
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the flour is so it stays where you want it to so if youre careful you could do it yes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the parts you want shiny are flat id suggest just sanding it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the letter is backwards the heavy bit in the bottom left of the letter as seen here is the top left of the d then the pen curls down around the arc of the d tothe curilcue which appears here in the upper left but is the bottom of the letter edit ok looking at the pic of the ashtray its less clearly so but i still think were looking at an invertedmirrored letter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ahhhh an ash tray wink wink nudge nudge
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well this is just from the i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah that would probably work find a few old dirty pennies to test on
whatisthisthing,not_removed,masking tape wont work very well in those tight spaces try a thick layer of vaseline instead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i actually dont have ketchup so ill be making the custom solution haha getting the tape in the more intricate areas might be difficult but ill definitely try it in the larger areas thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just put some on ill report back after minutes im not sure how long to keep it there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i did it a couple times to get the right consistency i think it looks good httpsimgurcomamsvde
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i didnt even think of that i dont have anything to sand it with but if this vinegar solution doesnt work ill try that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its possible it could be a ca httpsimgurcomamsvde
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mean its still ash just not cigarette ash lol and actually i was out of weed but wanted a joint in the pic to i could post it to rtrees so i made it with italian seasoning 😂😂
whatisthisthing,not_removed,still its an antique and its usually a universal rule that you dont clean things if you dont know that youre suppose to clean it ultimately this is assuming you want to sell is at some point if thats not the case then do whatever youd like best if youre unsure or care about its resale value as more of a idk status thing then dont mess with it until you talk to someone in that field edit i just saw the comment photos and personally i think it looks beautiful how it is now as a current smoker im jealous
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,glad i could help it looks great
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or just a c i see it now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your secret is safe with me
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i absolutely love it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you might post this at rhelpmefind as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,judging by the absence of any warningsafety signs i would say its a water reserve for firemen hence the fire hydrants but it could be a very poorly secured gas tank though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,underground water tank source i work for the water department in my city
whatisthisthing,not_removed,holy shit i immediately knew that was the corner of prince william parkway and smoketown rd if you make that left and see the high school on the left hand side that was my high school ive always seen technicians of some sort parked there investigating something every now and then the police sometimes linger around that location too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like an underground water storage tank or possibly a lift station definitely something to do with watersewer utility
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think so theres an air intake and air exhaust in the picture edit also that transformer is sized for a small building
whatisthisthing,not_removed,location probably an underground utility station water sewer gas or electric
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres a small artificial pond nearby it could be a water pumping station but thats just a guess also its close to the fire department so

whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for the answers i didnt know that different countries used different phone outlets
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those look like finnishnorwaydenmark phone jack converters any family travel for businessholiday in scandinavia and obviously these arent meant to be plugged into mains power they are adapters to convert their phone socket to use with your own equipment

whatisthisthing,not_removed,for cutting the top of the shell off a softboiled egg
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what is this called are they still available i would like to get one i eat a lot of eggs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i bought one of those it never did what it was supposed to do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,does anyone know if there is a sub for oddly specific mechanical devices
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive seen people eat eggs like this in old movies seems very inefficient way to eat a boiled egg eating it out of the shell with a spoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,first review includes a video that guy uses a horn spoon because metal taints the taste of the yolk that is some intense eggeating
whatisthisthing,not_removed,softboiled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not sure why youre being downvoted seems like we see this every few months but due to the nature of this sub users cannot really search for already found things very well unless its in the faq
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rspecializedtools
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rmechanicalgifs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,generally done when you leave the yolk runny
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how do you suggest eating soft boiled eggs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats really cool hats off to you for bothering to read the reviews
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he didnt say hardboiled but thanks for making sure we all know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we have very descriptive names for things you know that cute critter that sticks his food into water first raccoon thats a washing bear platypus beak animal sloth lazy animal

whatisthisthing,not_removed,gefahrennudel sadly snakes have no cool name but cucumbers are called snake cucumberpicklegherkin all cats know german thats why you can scare them with cucumbers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if snakes had no cool name then how did you know i was referring to a snake
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what else would that be snake is schlange in german and whats funny to me is that our igel is your hedge hog hah sounds like shrubbery pig to us
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be some type of removebeforeflightremovebeforeuse plugs we used similar contraptions in aviation of various sizes and shapes to plug openings in sensitive equipment when not in use to keep critters and debris out
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its plugs the go into an intake port for when youre moving an outboard motor
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just tried getting it to hold a roll and it couldnt so if it is that it really sucks at its job
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think those are plastic clips that are used for holding hooks to a pegboard that you would hang tools on they prevent the hook from coming off the pegboard while removing what is hanging on it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pegboard clips it is got lots of pegboard hooks too thanks where do i mark solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep pegboard hook clips
whatisthisthing,not_removed,got a whole drawer full of them slightly flexible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the round part is a pressure regulator it reduces the pressure to inbuilding levels im not certain why the flex tubes are there but id guess they are there because the pipe in the rgound is moving relative to the building it could be because the building it settling or the ground is settling or somethign else it would also decouple the building from the pipe in the ground if there was vibration say if a subway were nearby
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the name is flexible expansion loop of some vee shaped ones looks like the vee shape is so multiple lines can nest which is not possible with other shapes flexible expansion loops are used in earthquake prone areas this is the input gas line to the building the side coming up from the ground connects to the gas main the round thing is a pressure regulator it contains a big round diaphragm connected to a valve that opens or closes to regulate gas pressure the meter is inside the building and nowadays probably read via radio
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what treereme said thats the natural gas line going to the kitchen they put flex in the line so that the joints dont break open during earthquakes and cause gas explosions all over the city
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it would also decouple the building from the pipe in the ground if there was vibration say if a subway were nearby or an earthquake
whatisthisthing,not_removed,right it is an earthquake isolator that was properly installed

whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a maggot i dont think its a parasite
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it moves more like a maggot unless the stuff on the plate isnt letting it use its legs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not a fly maggot fly maggots have more of a writhing motion this ones gait was pretty uniform with a little hitch at the end of each push forward which is more typical of caterpillars its just a caterpillar that came in with the greens which is very common
whatisthisthing,not_removed,great case for washing veggies
whatisthisthing,not_removed,judging by the marks on the felt it held a set of calipersverniers the box is pretty typical for storing precision inspection equipment
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe a rifle case

whatisthisthing,not_removed,its roughly long by wide by high and lined with felt it looks like there used to be a handle on top which is odd because youd expect it to be on the side like a briefcase its quite heavy and has reinforced corners coke can for scale any ideas
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are those outside or inside dimensions id have an idea if the dimensions were about wide by high
whatisthisthing,not_removed,outside

whatisthisthing,not_removed,the drive bands were made out of copper a lot of soldiers would die when attempting to hammer the drive band off of an unexploded shell somebody in ops family had just the right combination of balls and luck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in all quiet on the western front there is an account of soldiers collecting driving bands that were loose on the battlefield
whatisthisthing,not_removed,why would they want to do this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pretty good considering that the title implies that op thought of this because of the anniversary
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly for resale to one of the locals a little extra pocket cash to spend on luxuries may have been worth it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikidrivingband
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it appears to me that you do not understand the difference between unfired and unexploded a shell that has been fired has obviously as the name says been fired and therefore of course has the rifling marks in the drive band an unexploded shell has also been fired but for whatever reason it did not explode be it a faulty time fuse or an impact fuse that hit soft mud it simply didnt explode but it was fired and because of that also has rifling marks on the drive band and finding a complete drive band amongst the shrapnell of an exploded shell is rare so this one was most likely hammered off of an unexploded but fired shell which was very dangerous
whatisthisthing,not_removed,after surviving somme i bet he was hard core

whatisthisthing,not_removed,went to mow the lawn i thought something had fallen out of the tree the broken branches were actually chewed off and smaller sticks were striped as we found some pieces of bark that had been pealed saw a nest going in the top of the tree far too high to get a decent pic wondering what makes a nest like this and if its a nuisance bird or not and we should get rid of before it ruins the tree
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yup thats probably it weve been seeing a lot more squirrels lately now that the trees are maturing thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there is no way to tell from a photo im going to shut the thread down because any answer is going to be meaningless sorry you need to get it tested id ask in one of the diyhome improvement subs if you need advice on where sometimes this is the sort of thing a govt dept will do for free

whatisthisthing,not_removed,isnt there somebody with their flair set to doorbell transformer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah it looks like an old door bell transformer one thing the small diameter wires give it away
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for that to be the case then it is in a very strange location not that it rules anything out as i mentioned the designers of my house were chock full of blow the actual chimes for my doorbell are between the doorbell button and the closet where the transformer so figure feettransformer in a line going deeper into my house could that be a reasonable way for that to be installed by crackheads if so then i expect you are right ive been digging around and the only other thing i could imagine it being associated with is the adt alarm system im not sure if it would even have a external transformer though ill do some testing thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure is can you confirm is this a doorbell transformer
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is in a very strange location seen doorbell transformers inside attached garages before far away from the front door the ringer and the elect panel who knows why
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i have a doorbell transformer just like that in my garage feet from the doorbell and feet from the button no idea why they put them in such weird places
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my old house in arvada had it attached to the disconnect for the furnace which was in the rafters above the downstairs bathroom
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes alarm systems generally do have a transformer as well and like the doorbell it tends to be somewhere with easy access to power rather than close to what it feeds the adt alarm panel in my house had the transformer in a nearby bedroom and it was but theres no reason to believe that they didnt make a version as well disconnect one of those low voltage wires for a moment to see whether the doorbell or the alarm panel fails its probably the doorbell
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they tend to stuff them somewhere out of sight out of the way and where its convenient to attach to an electrical circuit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a doorbell transformer all right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,part of it is you want to be able to get at them if they need to be replaced you dont really want them in a closet they get covered with clothes and stuff and get hot basement might get drop ceiling and then the transformer is hidden it also depends on the local electrical inspectors mood when the house is being built running the low voltage wire for the doorbell is trivial also dont forget it may run to a back door and a front door
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can i eat dis
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like mushroom mycelium i would assume the mushroom has gone soft and unapetizing if this is happening check with rmycology for more info
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its fine wont even taste funny if it worries you break off the stalk if in future you have lots of mushrooms you cant eat in time then finely chop them and gently cook off in either butter or a little oil splash of wine wont hurt if you have some needs using up put in bags and press out into a thin slab to freeze break bits off to and as required to soups and sauces gravies and casseroles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it looks like mold im not an expert on mold on mushrooms but i do grow mold on mushrooms for the purpose of artistic expression not an allusion to mind altering substances of but not limited to any sort probably wont kill you so scrape it off wash it and eat the goddamned mushroom dont come crying to me if you die though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like normal fluff i dont think theres a fungus on your fungus
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that is exactly what it is

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont eat that much of the stems anyway cut it off flush with the bottom of the cap imo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,imma eat it and ill let you know if i die
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do it when you first cook off i do a kind of madeira thingy really cook them down and sherry or port or anything and cook right down again superb flavour tops beef wellington a treat as well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its been a half hourare you ok
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks for that i love them to bits not a fan of wines ports in my food at all though and am the only one in my immediate family who does so while i have no problems just eating the lot in one go itd be nice to be able to use them as a sort of condiment when possible
whatisthisthing,not_removed,an hour now almost he dead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,am dead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sorry for your loss
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a pincushion from вднх for storing pins or needles and maybe using one of the halves as a thimble httpsenwikipediaorgwikipincushion httpsenwikipediaorgwikithimble httpsenwikipediaorgwikivdnkhrussia
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i notice its already been answered but i thought i would add that that nut and bolt on the top were almost certainly added at a later date i would guess a loop for attaching to a chain broke off at some point and someone added that nut and bolt
whatisthisthing,not_removed,good news its a suppository
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the bolt is quite ugly and makes me think that it shouldnt be visible given that the rest is so ornate my guess is that it was used to mount this on something some more info googling it seems that bdhx is a place in moscow i think a park where each part of the ussr had a pavilion to showcase its achievements so perhaps this is a souvenir from there not sure what the contents is maybe it actually is rosin
whatisthisthing,not_removed,prayer bead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it possible its an incense burner for orthodox mass
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be black musk its a popular perfume in moroccoor uses to be my mom brought some back after her time in the peace corps there years ago and it still smells every time we open the container
whatisthisthing,not_removed,antique bottle pendant for smelling salts the pine bead is likely something that was once soaked in ammonia menthol or some other inhalant sometimes these were just filled with fragrant purfume oils for dealing with unpleasant smells the part on top with the nut and bolt probably had some kind of ornamental bead attached or a small chain
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the thing inside could be just a type of wax wax is used by seamstresses sewerspeople who sew to stiffen thread rubbing the thread on a piece of wax and then rolling the thread between your fingers makes it easier to thread a needle my mother kept a disk of beeswax in her sewing kit for this purpose
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved at least i think so i cant read cyrillic so i will have to take your word for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thin ustanpol and upatnet are onto something i venture that its a needlecase repurposed to contain bow rosin for a violinist or other bowed instrumentalist
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i read that as professor farnsworth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like this was definitively answered whilst i was writing my comment wonder what the contents is though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,huh
whatisthisthing,not_removed,opium has a flowery sweet smellor so im told
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when op mentioned the pine smell my thoughts went to hash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,black tar is used to describe heroin not opium i can think of a thousand reasons why theres no way this is an opium stash but the best reason is that no serious user is going to forget about that much dope also opium qua opium is rather rare these days because its very difficult to prepare and smoke efficiently sure you can put a little opium on yr weed but you are going to lose most of the high why bother when heroin is cheap and plentiful and can easily be adulterated with anything from corn starch to fentanyl
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the wax also helps prevent tangles and knots when hand sewing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the thing inside is metal i think it honestly feels kinda like lead
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the top part says moskva or how you say moscow in russian the bottom part isnt bdhx but vdnha its the name of a parkoutdoorindoor exhibition area in moscow
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not sure im good with that bow rosin has a different look and feel than what you are seeing here
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or just dark hash
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah cocaine has a unique smell too so ive smelled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because its very difficult to prepare it is dead simple to make opium opium is simply and quite literally the dried sap or gum of the opium poppy the gum is attained by simply cutting the seed pod several times and it will seep out and collect as a large sticky blob the only preparation required is to boil the opium gum in water filter out the plant materials and other contaminates and then evaporate the water back off again or so ive heard note this is in no way meant to be an instructional manual on the use or production of what is a controlled substance and this information is provided for educational uses only
whatisthisthing,not_removed,are you familiar with rosin ive had very heavy rosin that i would compare to a lead fishing weight in feel try rubbing it on some cloth and see if it leaves a residue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive smelled poop
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but its just a plant and the whole process doesnt sound all that more damning than making coffee
whatisthisthing,not_removed,have you ever rolled a pill thought not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,awesome ill try that and get back to you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,both of your comments are correct
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its way more fun than coffee
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a ratchet strap tightener was the sign a fabric sheet of some sort
whatisthisthing,not_removed,someone probably dropped their ratchet strap tensioner and someone hung it on a sign so they would find it or someone carelessly hung it on a sign and forgot about it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its missing the other half that fits in there and gets wound up to make it actually strap something down
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no it was a private parking spot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also called a come along
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no shit that might be why i said it was the tightener and not the strap
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a ratchet strap as op stated its for tying things down or securing loads
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably fell out of someones truck
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not at all a come along is a httpsenwikipediaorgwikicomealong used for moving heavy objects this is merely used to tighten up a load strap to keep items in place during hauling using this item to pull heavy loads would be difficult and possibly dangerous
whatisthisthing,not_removed,not so fast on the solve that is a and the wheel controls the raising and lowering of the cooking grate look close and you can see the cables

whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any idea if it has a specific name
whatisthisthing,not_removed,mark it solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its definitely a theodolite it could be used as a sextant if you were sighting on anything but the sun and yeah some sextants do have plumbbobs to read the angle from the arc
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it might be the stalk from a brussels sprout plant with all the sprouts removed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it was supposed to be broccoli or brussels sprouts or something in that family but either didnt develop properly or got eaten by critters
whatisthisthing,not_removed,hi that does seems like the most probable answer thanks solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i should have posted this earlier
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a set of httpwwwanybumpercomcabinetdoorbumpersphp im quite convinced yours came with a corner cabinet from ikea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it isnt its kind of rubbery plastic the back is straight and then you have those two rounded parts all plasticesque it was in a toolkit so i would expect that it has some handyman type of use its not smth you open if u think its full of aspirin or smth its not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ok i just checked it it actually has a sticker in the back so yeah it must be some furniture thing for stick to back or down for protection
whatisthisthing,not_removed,likely solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a blister pack for medicine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that seems right or theyre little rubber feet for something though if they were id expect them in groups of so i think its likely this
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is late but i never shopped at ikea though and it was in a toolkit like i said
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably a cushion for the parts during shipping kinda like the triangle thing in pizza boxes you could possibly use it as breast implants for your lego guys too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nothing likely about it those are definitely furniture bumpers here are before they are cut out of the larger sheet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yep definitely solved put some on these on a wardrobe myself not two days ago

whatisthisthing,not_removed,the larger black things are the smaller black things to the left of them are httpwwwbodybuildingcomstoresckpowerliftinghookshtml the chains have clamps on them for barbells httpwwwebaycombhpweightliftingchains
whatisthisthing,not_removed,edit apparently its a thing to just clamp chains on other things to make them heavier and more dynamic weight lifting chains provide a progressive increase of resistance that will build explosive strength by stimulating muscle contractions throughout an entire lift how big is it arm sized cuffs or leg sized what does the label say
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the black things look like gravity boots for hanging upside down no idea what the chains are for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,leg sized the label just has a brand i think youre on the right trackill double check the label and possibly have to mark this as solved chains for chains sake and gravity clips for legs

whatisthisthing,not_removed,near college park i have been here for years and never seen one
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they basically occupy the eastern half of the usa into canada you can buy eggs and cocoons depending on how involved your friend wants to be httpwwwsilkmothsbizlandcomactiaslunarearinghtm i have raised cecropia moths from eggs before
whatisthisthing,not_removed,he knows all about ordering one he just really wants to catch one himself hes into framing and mounting insects
whatisthisthing,not_removed,figured as much i did entomology in and several years there after honestly felt guilty about pining insects that i only see once every couple years since the only ones worth pinning hadnt even been able the reproduce yet weeks ago i caught a female polyhemus right before a big storm and cold spell brought her inside let her lay her eggs then put them on a tree of the correct species once it warmed up i expect ill be seeing a few extra around in a couple months
whatisthisthing,not_removed,tell him to make friends with someone who does swimming pool maintenance i used to find them all of the time
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats awesome this guy does that with mantises i think he has a polyphemus in his collection the only that i have are a cicada and a hercules beetle that i found on a job site that he mounted for me im more into animal skulls
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if its nahuatl therere a couple words it could be beloved is one possibility and makes sense in the context of the sentence you translated from romanian the other is that its tlaxotec which would be derived from tlaxotecatl meaning an inhabitant of tlaxotlan tlaxotlan is a city mentioned in the original nahuatl version though with a different translation the name might mean something like and according to spanishlanguage paper it was located northwest of tlatlelolco in whats now mexico city
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when i saw it i thought of a indigenous mexican place name i was just researching one in mexico city from the the thing with them is they have very fluid spellings my guess is a place name associated with this group tlaxcaltec
whatisthisthing,not_removed,youve got a better view than we do but are you sure that first letter isnt a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,from romanian to my belovedlong dreamed of i cant figure out if this tlaxohtec is a place or a god or what ill do my best to convey what the letters aremight be the first one is clearly a t the second one could be an e or an l the third one is most definetly a the fourth one is either an x or a z the fifth one is o the sixth one is most likely an h but could be lilr or l some letter the seventh is either lower t or capital f but less likely the eighth is an e and the ninth is a c so we have taoec the probable candidate the closest related thing i could find was tlazolteotl but thats a bit different than what is written
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes his js are elongated at the bottom and this one looks pretty much like his other ts
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i dont think the second letter in the place name is an i this person seems to consistently dot their lower case i more likely an e i see teaxohtec no idea what it could mean though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it was an e at first too but its bigger than the a and about the same height as the h and t so i guess its a lower case l

whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i knew there was a name but couldnt for the life of me remember not my field just an adjacent one ive seen a lot of over the years
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it has to do with where trucks are allowed to go httpwwwdotcagovtrafficopstrucksquickguidehtml
whatisthisthing,not_removed,quick summary for the lazy the ssigns are service access signs showing where staa trucks may exit the interstate onto a local road for one mile only for food fuel lodging or repair and the tsigns are trailblazer signs showing terminal access routes where staa trucks may exit off the interstate and travel onto state and local routes these tsigns are also posted on the state and local terminal access routes at decision points if the tsign is not posted a staa truck may not travel there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the in and out is a must stop in those trips
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i always stop at the in n out and then head west on the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this just a ca thing i work for maine state dot and we dont post any of those signs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what does staa stand for i know the class includes semis but ive never been able to find what the acronym means
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but the flies wtf
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but runs northsouth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,west
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah according to the above article its because california state code cvc limits the overall length of a vehicle below that of other federal standards exceptions to the state law however exist for the federal interstate highway system and other terminalaccess routes as marked by the above signs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i havent noticed one of these signs anywhere else but i also never wondered about the s and t sign before this post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,staa stands for surface transportation assistance act the point of the act was to as i understand it establish a route for staa trucks trucks that are larger than legal in california to operate on the interstate and stay compliant with ca laws httpwwwsacdotcompagestruckroutesstaaaspx edit clarification when i say larger i mean longer not heavier in this case
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the surface transportation assistance act of allows large trucks referred to as staa trucks to operate on routes that are part of the national network the federal highway administration fhwa provides standards for staa trucks based on the code of federal regulations title part these standards designate the minimum truck sizes that all states must allow on the national network
whatisthisthing,not_removed,true it sort of runs northeastsouthwest though so i see where hes coming from
whatisthisthing,not_removed,because they started out here before they were given numbers they just had names the pasadena freeway the hollywood freeway later when they were given numbers we kept the the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats not all ca im from the bay area and i always say or no the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,partially because we have so many it feels really awkward in speech to say that your daily commute takes you on to then to to but adding the makes it feel much less awkward
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the road does get salted by the tears of students making the commute
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yea heading south towards the james dean junction it heads a bit west just nitpicking since this is the first time ive seen the area ive lived most of my life show up on a nonlocal subreddit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its largely a socal thing stemming mostly from the laoc areas san diego does it too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,partially because we have so many there are just as many numbered interstates and other highways on the east coast and it doesnt happen here that cant be the reason
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats called a bridge law in ca the center of the rear axle can be no farther than ft from the kingpin of the trailer some other states also have bridge laws but ca and ut which is also ft have the shortest the per axle weight is the same as the rest of the country but keeping your tandems under lbs with them so far forward can be tricky with a heavy load
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah we do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im british so none of this is relevant to me but this conversation reminds me of the snl californians sketches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when i drive to work in the morning i get on at then i go miles and get off at are and referring to roads or the time or both
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you have a simple answer for why it would be different from state to state why does that particular measurement matter
whatisthisthing,not_removed,petition to rename the south to the san diego parking lot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as a trucker the short answer is revenue long answer would be some nonsense about pressure on roadway
whatisthisthing,not_removed,same thing going north lately
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nope wrong again
whatisthisthing,not_removed,you can do what id do and just try different things until it worked or you can take my word that its an ear wax removal thingy
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ear cleaner maybe most look more like a tiny spoon
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ear cleaning stick
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for the love of god remember this isnt soft like a q tip dont just jam it in
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is this thing as ineffective as a qtip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you isnt this a tad dangerous to be shoving into your ear canal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the most risky ear cleaner ive ever seen
whatisthisthing,not_removed,technical term is a curette
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont just jam in a qtip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no its for breaking up hard dried up earwax that typically happens in the outer part of the ear canal or scraping the lobes the kind that really bonds with the skin a qtip gets out gooey earwax that happens in the inter canal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes and i wonder if thats why it wasnt labelled in your kit you cant sue them if they never said to put it in your ear
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe so but seems to be the intended purpose google image shows that and some crazy whisk type as well as spoons edit mobile bs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cheers i did not know that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,current leak does it have a dimmer switch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think it has to do with how the power supply is design likely a small short or a design defect raskelectronics might give an explanation if you really want to know what kind of circuit can do that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the answer on bill clives youtube channel when he tears down led lamps he points out the common flaw that causes led lamps to remain dimly lit when off if it has it i cant recall exactly what it is but fixing the problem requires a couple passive components and many lamps dont bother in their drivers in the past three months several of his lamp teardowns have had this flaw
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its httpswwwyoutubecomuserbigclivedotcom if anyone is searching for it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,indeed personally whilst i love my taotronics lamp i believe there are flaws caused by them cheaping out finicky dc jack power supply hums at high brightness settings

whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it could be a wax seal stamp not sure about the origin though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah its a seal fob the b is just a generic monogram as was common it looks to be gold filled and from the late to early looks like its gotten a bit squished down also weird stone it looks like banded agate which a good deal of them are but no clue with the quartzy crystals in the center
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the quartz crystals in the middle are just the center of the geode agates are just a form of quartz that fills in a void in the rock the larger crystals formed in the last bit of void cool seal fob

whatisthisthing,not_removed,vinegar goes in the grape shape oil in the larger vessel surrounding it it looks sorta interesting when filled

whatisthisthing,not_removed,wine aerator looks like the glass is even blown into grapes on the inside
whatisthisthing,not_removed,fairly sure that is a wine decanter you can put ice or cold water in the inner vessel to keep it cool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so how does it work does it mix the two somehow or is it just to keep them both in the same bottle
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those are grapes cause vinegar is made from wine
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh that does make more sense thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like a shower curtain clip
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if it pulls apart at one end then id say this is definitely right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it says given by hrh the duke of sussex to prince leopold of saxecoburg afterwards king leopold i of belgium
whatisthisthing,not_removed,snuff box or patch box i would be wary of believing the note thoughthere are quite a few snuff boxes that once bore the label patronised by the duke of sussex and prince leopold and its very possible that someone read a disintegrating label as presented when it actually said patronised
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so heres the story with these two pieces i found them while going through my grandfathers house and inside i found a note saying that these were a gift from the duke of sussex to prince leopold of saxe coburg then theres something about king leopold of belgium that i cant quite make out now my family are most certainly long term hoarders and we have tons of old english stuff that we dragged over to america with us in the but to my knowledge we were landed gentry with a little bit of noble blood mixed in although the highest i have been able to find is a baroness so my questions are a what are these and b how could they have possibly gotten into the hands of landed gentry
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,in case you didnt get this far httpsenwikipediaorgwikidukeofsussex and the title expired when he did in leopold was married to the princess of wales her father was goerge iv and sussex was georges brother and thus her and by marriage his uncle she died after only a year and a half of marriage had she lived shed have ended up queen and leopold would have been king of england
whatisthisthing,not_removed,except it doesnt say presented it says given
whatisthisthing,not_removed,antique heirlooms have not always been highly regarded by generations that follow its not unheard of that important items get lost in the shuffle of accumulated and dispersed property they are passed down to surviving family members taken from struggling or decluttering estates passed to museumssalesservants etc even if they remain in the family sometimes heirs lose track of the importance of every single possession over time i believe your patch boxes are c miniature portraits they were given as keepsakes between families friends and spouses
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it does but perhaps it was paraphrased it just seems rather a basic although very pretty example to be given to a member of the royal family of the timethe snuff boxes of the aristocracy tended towards enamel and were often bejewelled
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we dont know that the note is original
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i definitely agree my family is very lucky we have paintings of every single one of my direct ancestors bearing my last name all the way back to my great great great great great grandfather in the sadly however i seem to be the only person in the family who has any interest in them whatsoever
whatisthisthing,not_removed,and perhaps it wasnt what makes you think it was i mean what evidence makes you think it was as opposed to an inference from an assumption as for being a basic gift it was the century and as actually came up in a discussion in my family recently gifts between royalty tend to be either very small a memento a miniature portrait or very large a dukedom or a navy this strikes me as the sort of thing sussexwho was remember the sixth son and ninth child of george iii well down the line of succession and inheritance sure he had money and property and influence but he wasnt rolling in itmight have had lying around unused and passed on to the fianceenew husband of a favorite niece as a token of affection or maybe it was his favorite snuff box and little princess charlotte played with it as a child and he gave it to her husband when she grew up or any number of explanations
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no we dont but that doesnt mean we have to assume that the original said presented doesnt even mean there was an original
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats a shamegood on you for preserving your family history it would be a shame were it all forgotten
whatisthisthing,not_removed,quite possibly indeedi merely posted as a theory because as i mentioned this is commonly found label on snuff boxes and i was struck by the fact it was those particular names again it would be very exciting for the owner if a connection could be established i appreciate the pratchett quote im a fan
whatisthisthing,not_removed,
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my family all laughed at this commercial because we have the thera cane at home and absolutely love it everyone who uses it makes some sort of semiorgasmic groan when they discover how perfectly this contraption hits those sore spots on the back and neck seriously its right next to my homecoming drop zone and it gets used everyday looks goofy works great
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ill never forget going to comedy traffic school for a red light violation and expecting that i might both laugh and learn a little bit but i was greeted by a very angry man holding one of these hed had a back injury and was in a lot of pain and for eight goddamned hours he screamed at us jokes on me i guess but ill always remember what that tool is for
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks
whatisthisthing,not_removed,where are these now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that looks to me like material used to cover the sharp edges of a hole in sheet metal so that wires passing through the hole dont get cut

whatisthisthing,not_removed,gromit strip uk electrician and thats what we call it
whatisthisthing,not_removed,gromit strip and i agree it looks just like that is a dog
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sounds right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,technically gromit isnt a dog hes a lump of modelling clay and wire if were being picky
whatisthisthing,not_removed,op this is the right answer you should tag it solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,no hes really a dog opthat strip is for the hole the power cord comes through on the rear top of the unit source ive a similar oven
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like it could be an epo emergency power off switch but more likely as you are in a chem building it could be the emergency gas cutoff if they are running propane to the lab benches
whatisthisthing,not_removed,do you press firealarms for no reason too what if someone is running an experiment they took a long time to set up and suddenly the gas cuts off because someone hit the emergency shutoff if it was an emergency theyd understand if you hit it for no reason they might be mad
whatisthisthing,not_removed,never hit an epo button unless you have good reason to fire gas leak etc or are instructed to by someone who knows what they are doing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre called staple pliers to remove stuck staples with ease
whatisthisthing,not_removed,for a little more background we got this staple remover from a medical rep it also has a letter opener on it but no one in the office seems to know what these two prongs are on the side i guessed it might be to remove the staple if you were to straighten the prongs from behind but that seems to be a stretch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,id say this is solved

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this subreddit has unbelievable response time amazing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are at least a dozen of these things right off the side of the highway at various distances and elevations off of the road
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i want to say they are weather stations but i could be wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could be utility access
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there are pillboxes and bunkers on the coast left over from the world wars but they are usually at the entrance to bays or harbors some of them still have their guns
whatisthisthing,not_removed,if you track these they lead in a line from on the east side to on the west side which is the polonio pass water treatment plantpumping station some information about this the polonio pass water treatment plant is an unusual project in that it was built by the central coast water authority in conjunction with the coastal branch aqueduct a california department of water resources project to bring water to the central coast which brings water from the california aqueduct to san luis obispo and santa barbara counties httpwwwwatercagovswpfacilitiescoastalbranchcfm is a link with a map from california department of water resources those structures pretty much follow the route of the pipeline described above so i assume they are some sort of access structures that allow monitoring and maintenance of the water pipeline below better map of the project httpwwwwatercagovrecreationbrochurespdfcoastalbranchbrochurepdf and edit is where the pipeline connects to the california aqueduct and where these structures start from on the east side is a section of the pipeline going above ground and is the last structure before that point and the next one after
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my ex used to work for the state water project in lost hills for a year and i lived in paso at the time so we both did a lot of back and forth driving he said they were vents for the underground water piping this was literally almost years ago btw so i cant exactly go ask him now edit fixed typo
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe seismic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they are both access points and vents
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thanks for finding all of these references
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved i was wondering what the openings were for ventilation makes sense especially with the resources that uylph provided
whatisthisthing,not_removed,any idea what specific utilities might be under there
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would guess sewer but honestly have no idea i dont know the area so please take my post above as a guess
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well i just looked at the other comments and realized it was solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its an interactive response thing teachers used them for quizzes and such trying to find that exact one they all use apps now
whatisthisthing,not_removed,your submission has been flagged and remove as an branding question of a known item rhelpmefind would be a more appropriate subreddit for your question

whatisthisthing,not_removed,the pictures im seeing of cigar piercers have hollow points like needles while this one is a solid point are these things ever solid point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,then why post
whatisthisthing,not_removed,cigar punch cores out a hole add opposed to poking one in i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solid thanks will mark as solved

whatisthisthing,not_removed,holy crap that sounds like some game of thrones shit
whatisthisthing,not_removed,need the boiler model looks like it might be a high pressure cutoff switch which would keep the boiler from building up too much pressure not something you want to have happen please note im assuming you mean a boiler for household heat and not a hot water heater tank
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we just spent a lot on a new thermostat and now this has happened to our boiler which were worried that we wont be able to afford identified the brass valve to be leaking and would like to find out what this is exactly so we can try save some costs any help would greatly be appreciated by us and thank you in advance
whatisthisthing,not_removed,possibly a bypass valve but im not sure
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes looks like the pressure transducer and the body that couples it the rag underneath makes it hard to tell if it is just a simple coupling or part of a larger manifold
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its a hornworm possibly manduca sexta and of course its not actually a worm but an insect im not sure what you mean when you ask if its dangerous if youre a plant it might be or possibly if you eat it but it isnt going to pull a knife on you
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved thank you guys this is a very rare sight in dryhot morocco

whatisthisthing,not_removed,a tomato bug when i was little i used to get paid a penny for each one i killed with my bb gun
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my brother found this in his vegetables garden
whatisthisthing,not_removed,usually when someone asks is it dangerous they mean is it venomous
whatisthisthing,not_removed,dont you call these caterpillar
whatisthisthing,not_removed,on the ground its getting ready to pupate its a tobacco hornworm and it will turn into a beautiful
whatisthisthing,not_removed,as a side note never feed a reptile a hornworm you found outside tomato and tobacco plants the most common food plant for us hornworms are full of chemicals that are toxic to most reptiles
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats not very good pay
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a big one can take down an entire tomato plant in a day kill it if you dont want a repeat next year yes i know its neat looking but it eats your food without permission
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or can it bite the shit out of me and cause harm to my person
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes you do
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or a very efficient method of killing them
whatisthisthing,not_removed,is it near a window it could be an anchor for rescuers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwrotrexonsitecoukfallprotectioneyeboltsandpushlocks rotrex anchors for rescue operations source ive used them before
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is an anchor for something might not be safe might be reserved might be a legal requirement for osha or some such agency depending on location that requires all features or devices be labeled as do not use to cover against injury for unauthorized use
whatisthisthing,not_removed,we have these near all the windows in our office building periodically a bloke come by and checks if they are loose he said they were for rescue equipment so presumably the fire brigade would attach some sort of harness to it to lower people out of the window
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yes its by a window why would rescuers need an internal anchor point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats the one thanks everyone
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so the do not use if to keep it clear and reserved for the operator
whatisthisthing,not_removed,they can tie a rope to it and lower people or stuff out the window
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it is a little difficult to imagine that the anchor point is parallel to the window so any line hanging from it out the window would be rubbing against two wall edges
whatisthisthing,not_removed,may not be for rescue its just a general fall protection anchor point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it could be still though perhaps more for fire crew evacuation than for evacuating multiple victims being near the window would make it much easier to find and hook up to in the event of high smokelow visibility and i see to recall the local fd getting a grant or something for some form of evacuation rope gear to be added to the uniform in case of getting trapped by fire on an upper floor

whatisthisthing,not_removed,a key to or something canned similarly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,that used to be used to open canned hams coffee cans spam shortening and a number of other canned goods left behind a sharp edge that would cut the heck out of you sometimes the little strip would break off and leave you unable to open the can or youd lose the key sardine can keys were similar but longer with the slot in the middle i wonder what if anything is still sold with an opener key like this anyone know
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can opening was only its initial use in our house they were saved for cornonthecob use later
whatisthisthing,not_removed,looks like the key to open a can of sardines
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cannot believe this thread it goes to show as you get older what seemed natural to you soon becomes ancient i still buy tinned ham and tinned corn beef here in ancient england with these keys attached i have some in my fridge now and before someone says what the bloody hell are you doing with tinned food in the fridge well it cuts better when you open it and it does not freeze🙏

whatisthisthing,not_removed,cant believe i watched the whole thing that man is excited and passionate about canned meats
whatisthisthing,not_removed,corned beef i think
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those will necessarily have an open end so the plug is left in the tire when you remove the tool
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thanks i guess i forgot
whatisthisthing,not_removed,nah they make them both ways the closed eye type will come with longer strings since you have to pull the loop all the way back out and cut it to get the tool off
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats nearly impossible to id specifically it could be roofing tile old clay drain pipe piece of pottery ect
whatisthisthing,not_removed,can you post more than one picture with different angles please the layers make it look like pottery but i need to see the other sides i can compare it to the pieces in my collection

whatisthisthing,not_removed,it appears that you have some gauge signal flares included the metal item in the last image appears to be a flare launcher it looks like the cap unscrews from the body to insert a flare the knob would be the striking mechanism
whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the only image or listing i can find on the net for a similar kit you have a rare set keep it together you can email them and ask what they will give you for it httpwwwbellsaviationmuseumorg scroll down for flares and the distress signal
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzeqoemexvqi
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a google search revealed the mirror but not the rest of the kit maybe theyre not supposed to be together perhaps its some sort of a flare kit im also wondering if its military or civilian issue
whatisthisthing,not_removed,oh wow that is what it would be for certainly not going to test that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,solved
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it says department of aeronautics us navy on one of the pouches

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this is the sequins are prestitched onto a backing then the backing is stitched onto the object usually a costume of some kind the sequins are made of thin plastic and come in many colors available by the yard at most fabric stores

whatisthisthing,not_removed,son of a professional seamstress can confirm each disk is a httpsenwikipediaorgwikisequin i suppose a bunch of them would technically be sequins but no fabric store on the planet would call them that ask for sequin and youre in business

whatisthisthing,not_removed,this post is so sweet genuine grass roots rwhatisthisthing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,what shape
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im a maths teacher and last month had to explain to an excited old girl that we were in fact learning about number sequences and not shiny things
whatisthisthing,not_removed,okay then roxxxy andrews
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i call them flat washers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,how to do you pronounce reeces pieces
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i wont let you be alone in downvote land without a banana and because i make things my first thought was washers too
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i reject this information
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think youre being downvoted because many people including op know that this was only posted to try to trip people up on the spelling of sequins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,thats what i would have said not cool that it was so down voted
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when i was little my mom would let us make christmas ornaments with beads sequins and small pins they were pretty cool ornaments
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ive also seen people think theyre called sequence
whatisthisthing,not_removed,httpwwwderbykisscom yes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,probably there are pillows are target that change color depending on which way you run your hand over the sequins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,those look like washers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lantejoulas in portuguese
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the word lentejuelas comes from the spanish word lentejas and it means little lentils lentils are a legume these resemble in shape and size
whatisthisthing,not_removed,pallíettur in icelandic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,typically round ones depending on who youre speaking with sequin and paillette are interchangeable
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sequins are cuppedfaceted paillettes are flat so these are technically paillettes
whatisthisthing,not_removed,there so shiny like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck scrub the deck and make it look
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i would have been bummed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,when life pulls you down put on a shiny sequence gown
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rices pisces
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i make things too but my things have sequins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,washers can come in all sorts of sizes i dont know how much a banana would have helped i mean center seems most obvious but tiny bolts need washers too i still think theyre washers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,people dont like incorrect guesses that dont even bother to say that they are guessing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,damn i got down voted for a correct answer oh well
whatisthisthing,not_removed,but its wrong
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i remember those we also made a glitter ball using a large styrofoam sphere and party plastic shot glasses place glue on rims of shot glasses and dip in silver or gold glitter affix by placing the bottom of one of the sparkly shot glass on top of the sphere use large pin to punch through bottom and into styrofoam repeat in a circle pattern all the way around and down man i miss being a kid in the
whatisthisthing,not_removed,roxxxy andrews
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the same people who call cuff links cufflings
whatisthisthing,not_removed,im a maths teacher and last month introduced the new topic of sequences by asking the yr olds in front of me what they already knew about them old girl theyre sparkly
whatisthisthing,not_removed,bone apple tea
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i mean thats practically a homophone and honestly most people arent going to see the word sequins spelled out in their daytoday lives
whatisthisthing,not_removed,these people are called ebay sellers
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the person wont usually accept a correction its how they still say it incorrectly as an adult a friend of mine says i just assume stay rather than go when he means id just as soon stay and he says it like this assyume lol
whatisthisthing,not_removed,my first thought was why then i saw roller derby and thought ok contextually thats actually pretty cool then i saw that they were a pair and after thinking about the logistics of washing them and getting them to lay properly whenever you wear them and the fact that you would advertise any time you scratch your butt i went back to not worth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,well yeah but try to cut his hand off right there and see what happens
whatisthisthing,not_removed,lovertjes low where chess in dutch or pailletten
whatisthisthing,not_removed,paljetter in swedish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ah i know lentils makes sense why sequins are called lentejuelas in spanish cool plus lentil soup is amazing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,paljetter in swedish
whatisthisthing,not_removed,technically paillettes is french for sequins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,or a shah
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just cover everything with glitter whether i want to or not
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theyre definitely sequins
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i guess that makes sense they do look like the washers people make armor out of for conventions though
whatisthisthing,not_removed,the majority of comments in this sub are guesses without it being said people are just being pricks maybe op should have included a banana in his pic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its not wrong until its solved

whatisthisthing,not_removed,bone app the teeth
whatisthisthing,not_removed,a rib of deer cheese
whatisthisthing,not_removed,sure but why in the world would the established meaning of sequence also mean these things

whatisthisthing,not_removed,because they lay flat and are sewn into orderly lines to make intricate designs i dont know pulling this out of my ass before reading this string of comments i never even considered that sequins and sequence sound similar that said now im thinking about how sequins is a really weird word disclaimer no im not stoned

whatisthisthing,not_removed,what really
whatisthisthing,not_removed,ترتر terter in arabic
whatisthisthing,not_removed,so once something is solved all incorrect comments must be deleted or maybe it was originally posted with the solved flair since the purpose of the post was not to try to find out what they were called but to see how many people would spell sequins incorrectly has barely begun and people are already being dicks

whatisthisthing,not_removed,i agree with you probably a
whatisthisthing,not_removed,yeah i think you already solved this yourself dinosaur sounds right
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i think its the parasaurolophus in this picture
whatisthisthing,not_removed,agreedthe spiky thing that sort of looks like a spinning top or needle point is just a weird ring shes wearing and her finger is inserted into the puppet
whatisthisthing,not_removed,definitely this i had those as a kid
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i thought it was a lickalotopuss
whatisthisthing,not_removed,wow i though it was part of the puppet cant unsee now

whatisthisthing,not_removed,laminate
whatisthisthing,not_removed,either appliance is leaking fridge condensate catch pan could be overflowing or missing allowing a slow but consistent flow of moisture to seep into your floor and baseboard trim or your hot water heater is leaking allowing a similar situation in either case the moisture absorbing into the floorboards and baseboard trim will cause both to swell feel damp squishy to the touch
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe its just art
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just dont think anyone can convince me that this was done purposely for a functional reason
whatisthisthing,not_removed,its almost certainly a point to tie something see how you can slide a cord or strap in there dog leash maybe occasional barricade for stairs
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i cant think of any purely practical reason for this construction it almost certainly is at least partially done for artistic reasons where exactly are those stairs what do they lead tofrom there are several metal construction companies in bergedorf this doesnt happen to be right in front of one of those advertisement
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i just imagine the poor guy who was drawing the plans for the railing must have sneezed
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe for oldsters to hook their canes to help them up the steps
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe so that a bike or two could be attached there against the railing
whatisthisthing,not_removed,could it be to deter skateboarders
whatisthisthing,not_removed,maybe inspired by the teapot in the old pipes screen saver
whatisthisthing,not_removed,i like to think the job foreman walked over with a length of pipe and told the installer to make it fit assuming it would be cut to length but the installer had other plans that day
whatisthisthing,not_removed,just to spite the red bike rack in the background and to spite people wanting to use the handrail
whatisthisthing,not_removed,would have to be on the top rail for that this would be perfectly functional for skatingbiking
whatisthisthing,not_removed,theres a teapot in that
whatisthisthing,not_removed,rarely
whatisthisthing,not_removed,neat im in the process of converting my ancient laptop into a permanent pipes screensaver that ill frame and put on the wall hopefully ill catch that phenomenon with my own eyes at some point
whatisthisthing,not_removed,it appears to be homemade its painted on what looks to be a piece of plywood and connected to the persons mailbox sorry for the quality of the photo the sign is in the shade of the mailbox
whatisthisthing,not_removed,also this yard has had a bunch of homemade signs in the yard supporting trump and other extreme conservative altright stuff lock her up remove illegals etc which makes me wonder if this is some sort of secret code symbol of the altright
