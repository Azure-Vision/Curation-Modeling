wow,removed,prayforme nobetaforfane feelsbadman
wow,removed,youre such a oust
wow,removed,i just pmd you a free account it should be active until august as i just used it to get an raf mount a week ago you should change the passwords add your contact info and set up authentication enjoy
wow,removed,httpwwwinstantgamingcomigrfatkeee big discount for early access
wow,removed,i like how blizzard thinks that giving my inactive account beta access will make me come back to the soulless husk that is modern wow think again rest in peace nostalrius the only good version of wow
wow,removed,sorry did i pick the ask a question option with a side of sarcastic asshole as first reply sorry my bad and i didnt post it in the beta megathread as its already too old and people dont read it that far down
wow,removed,fuck off retard
wow,removed,true but better luck trying then not p i know everyone probably wants too play the post is mostly fpr if they have multiple accounts and they have multiple invites lol the hype train is just too strong
wow,removed,i am interested in using the account but i cant log in when i try to log into the game on the launch screen i enter the email address and then the password but the password you gave seems to long for the space allow this is what i am using username cindermanechargermountgmailcom password cindermane charger mount ive tried the password without spaces with spaces with and without caps nothing works so far maybe you can give me a tip as to what it is i am doing wrong also what server are you on since there is cross server content i would maybe start on any server and not a pvp one i appreciate all of your time thanks again
wow,removed,i think some people just want some cool stuff but i get what youre saying also youre talking about the community sucking yet youre sitting here complaining about other people complaining which is just as bad chill out
wow,removed,right someone who understands the system wrong someone who doesnt understand the system youre wrong if you think that the prestige system is going to somehow destroy rated pvp because all hardcore rated pvpers are going to be stuck prestiging for honor every season because of the infinite amounts of better rewards get it there is no opinion here just a misunderstanding so lets bring down the haughty selfrighteousness a notch please
wow,removed,can i have your stuff
wow,removed,there you go golfclap
wow,removed,no one cares people die everyday youre no one special
wow,removed,i hope you didnt play a male draenei
wow,removed,youre an idiot take your useless opinion back to the private server sub le lag fucking cancer
wow,removed,at the moment us month tokens are worth and eu is worth from what i hear you might need to offer more if you dont get any takers
wow,removed,i seriously dont get how you people cant understand basic fucking proportions im saying the models themselves will not have a greater absolute ingame size they will be the same size relative to your characters model as they are now therefore by looking at the scale of the character model you can easily estimate how big a boss will appear on the screen irrespective of anything else in the fucking screenshot
wow,removed,rules of socializing especially in wow no politics no religion
wow,removed,thanks for sharing now go back to your basement
wow,removed,it is people attacking a person holy shit can you read if im at hp before a second person hits me how the fuck is that even a im not arguing about global attacks lumped in with abilities i am talking about people attacking a person simultaneously just like this screenshot shows youre not jesus fuck learn to read
wow,removed,hence the you stupid fuck
wow,removed,you can just use an auto clicker which i dont believe is against the rules d just put the card link on a button and autoclick it till youve flipped them all
wow,removed,you tell me
wow,removed,theres so much negativity going on about everyones main being gutted and generally shitty from who nostalcucks running high on the circlejerk all specs of priest and warlock are pretty much universally praised you could be faster pointing out the specs that people are complaining about than otherwise tanks removal of mitigation abilities now has tanks being useless meatwalls at the mercy of healers with little to no control over the fight arms dull and boring and significantly worse than fury outlaw worse combat still not bad just worse combat havoc sparkling bait for years old xxxillidanxxx kids very simple filled with lasers double jumps new animation and particles eyecandy hunters all specs are very simplejust like every other expansion since cataclysm thats about it
wow,removed,
wow,removed,whore
wow,removed,oh a tranny film
wow,removed,that is irrelevant but i guess youre too retarded to see that
wow,removed,youre the one coming onto a website and being a retard then saying that it was all just an act simply because youre too prideful to admit that you were being stupid
wow,removed,go away troll ive provided numbers you havent
wow,removed,maybe get better you fucking scrub no wonder nobody will raid mythic with your bitch ass lmao kys
wow,removed,no you retard the people exploiting spawn a shit ton of mobs that give ore when killed you could be doing the exploit just by tagging any mob that they spawned thinking you could get some free ore from another miners spawn which is legitimate the exploit itself is bugging a single mob that you can infinitely mine to get the other rare basilisks that contain ore to spawn any random person that passed by could tag those without even being in your party and get the ore you could just sit there in the normal questing area and see a lot of the yellow basilisks spawndue to the mob that can be infinitely mined and tag them and youd get banned even people who got less than ore got banned thats like of those mobs
wow,removed,
wow,removed,you must really hate the guy you made that ui for
wow,removed,im saying you are giant baby and cant handle a pvp server even yourself said earlier you are a carebare and dont even do the pvp youre a baby that thnks it should only apply when you want it to apply which is what a pve server is reroll or quit the bitching its a part of the server
wow,removed,kill yourself really
wow,removed,he had mild autismaspergers
wow,removed,does it occur to you that many dont agree with you shut the fuck up already spamming the comments with how bad you think it is suck a dick
wow,removed,grand autismo
wow,removed,lol do you gain anything from making an ass of yourself on the internet
wow,removed,seriously how do you even walk down the street without tripping over
wow,removed,because blizzard needs shekels
wow,removed,undead are perfect as is imo animation is very cool and it fits them nicely trolls need their squatting back just like in and just like voljin does in soo cinematic when they talk with varian
wow,removed,consistent updates year droughts since cata only game paying ingame stores mounts and pets exclusive to the store no other special mounts released server upkeep lliterally every other game does it for free if you guys werent fuccbois and preordered they would have changed their minds when they saw the preorder numbers but know you all gave in instantly
wow,removed,just clicked it my head that thats why we lose tirion on the broken shore he already used his last blessing
wow,removed,picking the aoe talent for the aoe pull and then switching to the single target talent for the st fight is amazing and engaging gameplay bloodwinger years old
wow,removed,right now there is no official way to play wow like it was before however this might change at some point there are private servers if you just google wow private servers youll find some stuff
wow,removed,hang yourself
wow,removed,play a private server so you dont have to pay blizzard to play the game they have these days
wow,removed,kinda of a no brainer the ashbringer was the first shown artifact and the sword allmost allways change hands due to death of the wielder
wow,removed,you could have you know not autoloot see your incoming legendary link it then loot the legendary when i saw my second legendary i just started typing retard stuff in guild chat and then looted it afterward
wow,removed,easy fix if the person who used the keystone is vote kicked then reset the dungeon back to
wow,removed,you are fucking retards you love mythic because you dont spend your key so from everyone whos give you theri keys fuck you
wow,removed,if you demand leader from the types of mongos that do this theyll just hearth and leave the group anyway how about we focus on reporting the people responsible for causing this bad experience and less on red taping the process ive done mythic carries from keys and i can promise you the people who get the best out of us and are offered the loot we get that they can equip are the ones who are chill and mutually gracious to the level we are for the beneficial relationship dont make this a i have the pussy so i make the rules situation when its just going to make you look like an idiot
wow,removed,the ultimate repost
wow,removed,mimiron phase
wow,removed,please stop being so sencetive holy shit
wow,removed,looks like im stuck waiting two weeks before i can get that perk im in the middle of upgrading to the last one thanks blizz for not allowing us to cancel that shit not like id ever get double legendaries let alone one its not like i do multiple mythic pluses every day and daily emmisary quests no
wow,removed,stop being such a fucking baby bahhh he was mean to me bahhhh
wow,removed,why stop being so fucking sencetive and reporting for fucking anything
wow,removed,if anyone stops playing because of something this minor they shouldn´t play a online vido game at all good lost i say
wow,removed,wtf this is literally hate speech delete this h
wow,removed,yeah i thought it was pretty unanimous sjws suck nowadays
wow,removed,wahhhhh people are being mean wahhhhh fuck off please
wow,removed,why do you think days entitles you to a legendary
wow,removed,you spaz you dont even realize this whole post is about not being selfish get a fucking clue
wow,removed,i think greg should firstly kill himself and then stay away from wow forever there was a reason he was let go
wow,removed,did the cats survive the abuse
wow,removed,what a fucking drama queen they will restore your account to you and even restore your characters but the damage is already done someone needs a reality check
wow,removed,you insult me like im a child i have girls and your whole post sounds like my year old when one of her friends breaks a building in minecraft waaaaaaaaaay over the top end of the world whining when the reality is your going to be mildly inconvenienced for a short period of time
wow,removed,
wow,removed,
wow,removed,
wow,removed,
wow,removed,you should go outside and play in traffic instead
wow,removed,it was only a matter of time before you legacy server people came backjust play the game
wow,removed,i approach modern wow as a different game and its great it really helped me to get out of the bitter legacy state of mind i would still love classic servers but for now it is what it is it would be great to see a new game find along that does the old things right again
wow,removed,oh good this again fuck off
wow,removed,thats your brother you fucking retard also no one gives a shit
wow,removed,get lost legacy talk isnt allowed here
wow,removed,lmao is this a joke
wow,removed,go back to
wow,removed,hes not a retard hes a lying sack of shit
wow,removed,no thanks id rather blizzard focus on one product instead of trying to simultaneously manage their current iteration and all previous versions plus people forget how absolutely tedious previous iterations were the roi of legacy servers is basically a rounding error theres no point of sustaining eight or nine game states
wow,removed,
wow,removed,a since ended tshirt based donation drive what does that link have to do with anything
wow,removed,hasnt blizzard said that they never will do this sorry that your private server got shut down but theres no reason you couldnt resurrect the project and just host it overseas
wow,removed,
wow,removed,except they have previously fixed this problem for numerous people you have no clue wtf you are talking about and should just go back to whatever you are doing since you are retarded
wow,removed,it hasnt even been a month yet jesus christ you people are such babies
wow,removed,my my what a pesky little attention whore we got here you wont shut up even if you are off topic are you the topic was that the real catch up mechanic the current tier is the only tier didnt come before wotlk the sloppy implementation of the prototype of that at bc didnt help to get faster in sw that that was the topic now fuck off kthxby
wow,removed,i got mine on my first kill you just have to go to dustwallow marsh and kill the dragon boss there and its around a drop chance i thought everyone who wasnt completely dogshit knew that guess i was right im implying youre dogshit
wow,removed,why do people defend timegated content so much fucking stupid
wow,removed,nope youll still get last
wow,removed,good thing they last days and they will most likely be fixes by then
wow,removed,you should know better than taking statistics and research as the end all be all welcome to my fantasy world kiddo yeah youre just retarded tagged as such and disabling inbox replies
wow,removed,then blizzard should ban people who do that stuff based on griefing
wow,removed,tons of people play at because its better and easier on your eyes
wow,removed,this is correct
wow,removed,good to know
wow,removed,its an mmo not a single player game making everything available now would impact the games player retention ability and hence sub numbers and profits the majority of my friends and myself are letting our subs run out due to timegated bullshit laziness and disregard for pvp and horrible balance apparently their philosophy to retain players isnt going so hot fanboy
wow,removed,even if you dont theres no reason to stay at if your pc can handle more
wow,removed,that is the stupidest comment i have ever seen
wow,removed,if youve never done a m you can get a or from a regular mythic if you have done m the prior week you will get or a whichever is highest
wow,removed,with the problems highlighted in this and being made obvious we might see improvements to prevent such behavior from sellers thats my hope i hate walls i only do them because theyre a necessity to compete on the ancient ah platform the triggered butthurt has been fun to read though my favorite so far is the idiot who will never understand playing the ah at this point in the game while doing exactly that on a regular basis when he just runs over dumps trade mats or whatever at under and grabs the cash from the mail box dudes got some real skill with the ol mental gymastics
wow,removed,because some of them are bugged right now
wow,removed,the walls are always per item cheaper that isnt true at all i specifically laid out how that isnt true you should reread the post
wow,removed,true but those stacks wont be sorted by whats cheapest per each you would need an addon or lots of patience to find that
wow,removed,you can check usable items to show all results on one page ill check this tonight but i highly suspect its incorrect especially when dealing with pages of ore not to mention that such functionality would surely improve the performance of addons
wow,removed,theres more that needs to be done but that is a huge part of it for sure
wow,removed,that isnt true at all
wow,removed,more like i do it because its one of the only ways to compete that is a lot of jerking yourself off i was trying to have some fun sue me p
wow,removed,see thats just mean
wow,removed,who gives a shit how much power their computer is using as for heat newer cpugpus would not be effected by running a little hotter unless you have a cooling problem in which case you should probably fix that there is no reason not to just let it run at whatever fps it wants to
wow,removed,overall every class has a spec that is better than all warlock specs
wow,removed,people who pay their own bills might care if an extra on your energy bill is breaking you reevaluate your situation reducing the life of your hardware again any new gpu could run at and still be fine long enough to be replaced by the next good gpu
wow,removed,every class has a spec that does more damage than all warlock specs
wow,removed,oh man im sorry there are specs that are even with spec of warlock out of how many dps classes yeah warlocks are still shit
wow,removed,to laugh at people as dumb as you keep on fanboying bro im sure one day blizzard will give you blowjobs
wow,removed,til how weekly wing releases work
wow,removed,no
wow,removed,huh youre right
wow,removed,demo and destro are middle of the pack affliction is garbage
wow,removed,this isnt max dps you tool its averaged across all parses for the last week anyone can take any class and make it do insane dps if they play at toptier level but a toptier warlock vs a toptier just about any other class the other class wins
wow,removed,theres no such thing as a obtainable bis list since gear can range from ilvl to
wow,removed,what is causing the damage are you running through rot on your way to drop your rot are you dropping rot at the same location as another player causing you both to take double damage are you popping defensive cooldowns you have so that you take less damage when rot falls off
wow,removed,o shit its jace boys
wow,removed,cant tell if serious
wow,removed,you mean like all the stuff it does to tell you how mechanics work that literally people use
wow,removed,yeah it was confirmed last tuesday
wow,removed,its an addon called shiftj
wow,removed,that is an absolutely horrible way to find out which is best
wow,removed,yes they are for beating on no youre never going to get any amount of useful information from doing so
wow,removed,i refuse to pay to enjoy the game anymore on my dead server i really wish theyd give us free xfers and id consider playing dead characters on other dead realms
wow,removed,easy content just got easier
wow,removed,graduated a virgin too i see
wow,removed,fuckin nerd
wow,removed,
wow,removed,dude i just fought ten waves of giant dildos
wow,removed,in december wrong itemstats you seem like a great dh to ask questions to xd
wow,removed,well yeah but wouldnt grandpa have wanted to help save people with his retard strength had he been aware still
wow,removed,looking at your logs i am talking about it if id think the logs would matter i wouldve posted them weirdly enough i didnt maybe its because i dedicatedly said that i dont raid and those raids were mostly pugged i dont watch trash sorry
wow,removed,equipped dh tank logs progress httpwwwwowprogresscomcharactereudraenoryuberr armory httpeubattlenetwowencharacterdraenoryuberrsimple ps this xepheris guy is talking out his ass dont follow his advice
wow,removed,they implemented that tracking last week
wow,removed,this is not a timer though only partially and the main part is the key level speed runs were obviously irrelevant since you could just do with a grp and do it in mins within the last two weeks everyone noticed this change though and thus competed against it i dont brag i said over and over again that i dont raid and the logs dont matter since its pug anyways but if i raided these would obviously matter since they are the highest ive done yet and for a random group with as i also said wrong talents is not bad measurement for mythic then its not like you suddenly would fall just because its higher difficulty especially on guarm
wow,removed,weakauras httpartifactpowerinfoweakauraxepherisphp addons bartender masque shadowed unit frames gottagofast worldquestgroupfinder world quest tracker keyed keybooster itemlinklevel thats mostly it can upload the wtf folder when im home
wow,removed,gibs me da karma
wow,removed,and fail the timer miserably and still rank which only makes sense since after all you finished it which still has to place you higher than someone who didnt even finish it besides those are greyed out dont get me wrong im not saying its a perfect system or that wowprogress is good in any way but barely anyone wouldve cared about the for example if that system wasnt in place same with artifact power nobody wouldve cared about world ranks on that either if i hadnt found out how to track it since there was no way to compare before nevermind that median in m en rather obvious that i was way worse back then again shitter guild talking it up like thats the metric that clearly shows never said that since i dont raid it clearly isnt the metric that i care about constantly two chesting on the other hand is
wow,removed,you on euw btw lets try this out then
wow,removed,the demon hunter in question that does only mill less than my group is bad aswell though since mill with basically the same gear shouldnt be possible and if both are equally bad then clearly dh rogue as a class in this case
wow,removed,who said i dont have legion i just said its awkward for people to accept gifts who cant necesarry pay them back are you a dummy
wow,removed,then dont
wow,removed,thats neutral argueing
wow,removed,this guy has been trying to prove his theory for the past month on reddit now he doesnt understand simulations are a unrealistic resemblence its like an utopia also he basicly has no experience playingtanking all he relies on are his sims nice to know someone more skilled in the english language could write down my thoughts on this good job
wow,removed,the stream link isnt even his if you check his name on wowprogess i really dont care if you ban me for defending myself against some jealous kids i would simply create a new one none of that circlejerk actually had anything to contribute as others pointed out as well
wow,removed,so this is my account site wide bans are impossible why do you even bother in the first place its absolutely ineffective plus you banned me for absolutely subjective reasons
wow,removed,the wowhead guide is very bad and not up to date and the discord is a cesspool of average players circlejerking they refuse to acknowledge just anything thats beyond their limits
wow,removed,im asking again why do you bother
wow,removed,so where is it your site wide ban why do you speak of it when you know its not possible
wow,removed,did you read the same comment as me legendaries wont get you benched in a serious guild if you have more characters with better legendaries you can switch to roger leveled hunter and got both bis legendaries so he was fine sco leveled warriors and had to switch midway through raid prep because the second one had better legendaries youre an idiot if you think the system is even okay because the top raiding guild levels multiple characters for legendaries
wow,removed,shut up you filthy the guy deserves it and you know it go ban me and abuse your mod powers for the sake of keeping the subreddit opinionfree go join some dictatorship
wow,removed,as ive stated before would a warrior trade ignore pain for last resort theyre not the same warrior is designed around ip dh isnt the value of the talents changes based on the mitigation it offers and soul barriers benefits simply outweigh the benefits of last resort as ive stated before you dont raid mythic content and clearly dont understand the value of a cheat if youre not raiding in an environment where cheats are useful you wouldnt find value in it majority of top vdh are running last resort for a reason fun fact last resort secured that kill as one of only people left standing what you dont see are the attempts where healers were distracted by dispels healing flame licks and let tanks drop the boss wouldnt have died had soul barrier been used
wow,removed,getting her into porn would be easier
wow,removed,lol are you retarded fucking idiot do you think i really think this guy on the tool is serious i found it cool how he mocked all the bitches that want ilvl on every shit and you gtfo
wow,removed,not toning down a shit hate those retards that wanna act cool and smart and be like haha you didnt get the joke and not realising they are stupid as fuck im pissed off but thats not the reason and i am not going to say it because who the fuck cares anyway i wouldnt care too about another fucker raging d
wow,removed,badly balanced trash thats the point everyone is making youre retarded
wow,removed,replace the first r in your name with f and it will fit you perfectly
wow,removed,no one asked and quit trying to pass off shit as your own wowhead made this
wow,removed,seems like someone has an ego problem nice trash website btw my year old sister could do better
wow,removed,this is the same pc bullshit that causes companies like mtg to go out of their way to specify that alesha who smiles at death is trangender it doesnt fucking matter at all stop pushing your stupid fucking head cannon crap on these things why do you care about who koltira is fucking on the weekend it is idiotic for you people to demand characters be specified as gay or trans or bisexual omniqueer cat kin blah blah blah grow the fuck up and stop posting stupid shit like this its bad enough that we have to know the sexual orientation of fictional characters in a fps go join moonguard if you want to talk about this shit
wow,removed,yes cant get it anymore think scarab lord is rarer even
wow,removed,yeah its very rare now to get it you had to have done the attunement quests for black temple and battle for amount hyjal so to have it now you would need to have played since tbc raided during tbc actually beaten a few of the raids in tbc before wotlk came out and since there were no lfrnormalheroics back then and no crossrealm grouping there were very few people actually raiding back then compared to now plus add in the people who started playing after the chance for that title and the people who have stopped playing since its a pretty small fraction of the overall player base still hundreds of times more common than scarab lord probably but rare
wow,removed,delete your folder
wow,removed,yet another case of a developer using highly demanding poorly optimized tech for no actual gains in performance or aesthetics
wow,removed,so you know how every caster class has one spammable filler they use while waiting for the rest of their skills to become relevant fire mages use fireball balance druids use wrath shadow priests use mind flay etc etc affliction uses drain life or traited drain soul or baseline in days drain soul their main filler spell heals them oh and like every other warlock spec they have soul leech which causes of the damage they do to be turned into a health shield that stacks up to of their health traitedbut for affliction its due to an artifact trait so when they spam their filler it heals them and gives them an absorb shield oh and chances are theyve traited siphon life which is a dot that does damage and heals you for of the damage donewhile also of course fueling soul leech beyond that theyve got super cookies where they automatically get healed for a small amount whenever a party member uses their cookie tldr affliction warlocks can basically ignore most mechanics because they heal themselves for a fuck ton and get an absorb shield affliction warlocks with prydaz can probably go to sleep mid fight
wow,removed,in other words no actual gains in performance or aesthetics
wow,removed,translation of your comment me too me too i want to stroke myself off too
wow,removed,no you wanted to stroke yourself off to other peoples approval
wow,removed,by the same note whyre you getting involved
wow,removed,understood but take your curiosity somewhere elsepreferably somewhere that isnt soaked in booze and rwows collective jizz
wow,removed,another thing that looks as if it were made by a two year old
wow,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
wow,removed,thank you for proving me correct and making yourself look like a pseudointellectual retard
wow,removed,lol your is ridiculous some of the classes are designed so badly they took away what was fun about them in hopes that rng would be something everyone likes

wow,removed,agreed mass killing worthless jews is efficiency this is being a jerk
wow,removed,i imagine this is the druid fairly easy to tell since you didnt blur half the name or the realm
wow,removed,dont forget where at the top of the post is a story about you supposedly the only monk who knows what they are doing bragging about clearing an after the timer lmao
wow,removed,is it close enough to make a good pun yes it really isnt you must be autistic or something to be hearing oldyouare in ulduar
wow,removed,fuck your shitty meme post you dont like being declined to other peoples groups quit whining and make your own i didnt mind warlocks before then after their constant whining and bitching i instant decline them regardless of ilvl now
wow,removed,carry groups have been around since vanilla get over it
wow,removed,guilds literally make hundreds of millions of gold and no one complains people do it for free suddenly and now its a problem

wow,removed,how dare you assume the dummys gender
wow,removed,when i say the rng is better or worse i mean that the entire system is less or more punishing respectively in my experience this is a pretty common way to speak of it its not but even if it was just because a majority says or does something does make it right
wow,removed,lesbians just like gays and bisexuals are abominations and thus deserve no rights or consideration at all
wow,removed,conforming the material to meet the expectations of the vast minority is classist
wow,removed,no

wow,removed,nice of you dunno whos gonna get it im not taking it
wow,removed,hopefully my friend who has no interest in wow came along with me and while he said it was ok i understood the next day he said he actually thought it was fucking epic and loved durotan but was sad when he died he still finds it hard to understand that a game can have such a massive lore and story behind everything hopefully a sequel will happen
wow,removed,hes a twisted fucking psychopath
wow,removed,no need to cry over something that didnt even happen
wow,removed,mists dropped from to thats half of what you said you retard learn to read charts
wow,removed,eh can be debated
wow,removed,i bet you masturbate to your characters furry worgen ass freaking furry
wow,removed,youre a fucking inbred retard if you think any of the top blizzcon competitors need an kick bot please dont comment on shit you have no clue about
wow,removed,i forget the horde one but i think its right before they go through the portal i dont know spoiler tags or anything so i apologize right after lothar accepts the mantle of reagent or whatever during king lanes funeral
wow,removed,hopefully a bus pins you
wow,removed,you must be a shitty hunter then ours are usually close to the top still and everybody is pretty much geared the same
wow,removed,youre actually retarded
wow,removed,holy fuck youre stupid
wow,removed,cuck
wow,removed,aare you an idiot
wow,removed,u look dumb
wow,removed,kinda related to op few years ago i caught this black guy outside my house took him in and chained him up next to the other cattle for a few days in my hiphop music farm well thing is this motherfucker got free and im lookin for him again so if u see a chimp called obama or osama or some shit lemme know k
wow,removed,youre just a fucking mongoloid theres no apologizing for that
wow,removed,cuz hunters have to be number one or qq
wow,removed,and judging my your retarded reply you play op fotm classes melee this exp is retarded everyone knows that casters got hit hard with nerfs and melee got to keep most of theirs generally you wanna talk shit go a head you wont be taken seriously trying to defend dh buffs come back when playing a dh takes skill or when you main a caster and have to cast and actually have skill to do anything until then stfu
wow,removed,did you hit that bro oo
wow,removed,lol you think arena takes skill and is balanced god you are thick come back when you know what you are talking about child
wow,removed,meanwhile we also downed mythic helya yesterday and we used hunters while at it d
wow,removed,theyre mana addicts you build and army of withered for them while also investigating suramar theres a tree that can cure the hunger for mana you get the seed and plant it fast forward tree grows you cure important npcs and start the assault on suramar mainly elisande whos the top bitch and needs to get killed story culminates with the partial conquering of suramar where all the bad guys lock themselves into the nighthold in days we go into the nighthold kill elisande then guldan gets rekt by illidan thats it
wow,removed,if you have an nvidia card you can use the geforce experience application that has shadowplay or whatever theyre calling it now which can automatically record the last x secondsminutes of your gameplay and also has manual recording its great quality and very low performance hit theres also alternatives such as dxtory or even twitch streaming software such as open broadcast software which also supports offline recording
wow,removed,sorry to hear that your gm is a retard
wow,removed,its not baseless if its true you are a an entitled whiny bitch youve embarrassed yourself enough in these forums do us all a favor and fuck off
wow,removed,holy shit what a retard
wow,removed,wait did this seriously get posted hr ago lmao dont delete this i want everyone to see
wow,removed,for the last time on behalf of everybody here fuck off
wow,removed,fight me you fuggin nerd
wow,removed,firstly you started it but being a dumbass at me and you are a child nothing more needs to be said about that i play bg because that is a lot more balanced when you have of each class rather then the fotm team crying is different to pointing out obvious bias which again is obvious by what you see and statements from the devs
wow,removed,post nudes plz
wow,removed,this is true i believe anyone whos plays wow is actgually afucking autristnig cnigger retardede
wow,removed,downvote me to hell pls k
wow,removed,i like wow i find enjoyment while logged in though the subs might not be as high as they used to be its still the highest populated mmo by far which kills your theory the game will still be here for a long time but believe what you will
wow,removed,i love wow but a striving mmo needs more potential for a future it is the most played mmo but tbh i really wish a new mmo would just come along and kill it
wow,removed,welp youve convinced me
wow,removed,httplmgtfycomqpatchwerkwow
wow,removed,theres a fixed bejewelled floating around i had one back in wod
wow,removed,play with my nuts
wow,removed,remindme hours
wow,removed,thrallsexual
wow,removed,ha ha ah hha ha ha ha ha funny ha
wow,removed,i dont really get the downvotes the night elves are fierce and will stop at nothing to defend their home but they have no interest in conquering and expanding their borders or blood and glory or any of that shit their main concern is making up for a mistake the vast majority of them had no part in and ensuring the well being of the world while the horde are constantly pushing into their lands harvesting their forests and killing their people they are well within their rights to hate the horde and make them pay when it is necessary because the horde specifically the orcs have almost always been the aggressor i also cant help but feel like if it was a strong orc dude who acted in a similar fashion to tyrande people would love him but because it is a strong matriarch she is a cunt or bitch but thats just my two cents
wow,removed,actually its a no gender person so you know
wow,removed,an illusion or my dick genital cant decide
wow,removed,meh tards are tards go figure they are mad shes a gurrrrrrrrl gamer i dunno all i know is shes pretty much the best soloer on the planet bar none
wow,removed,interesting i didnt know the game had that
wow,removed,are u actually retarded or just braindead
wow,removed,this comment isnt about whats the stringer mitigation tank its about what takes more thought then i realize im talking to paladins who think playing paladin takes thought process to comprehend the topic rofl this reply is as thoughtful as paladin tanks requiring thought
wow,removed,its how it is for every artifact that has two components only the main one gets updatedtruthguard for paladin for example youre healer was a retard
wow,removed,yea the correct term is ape
wow,removed,why do you care what someone else does with an item regardless if they use or sell it you lose a satchel and they gain something its called capitalism you socialist fuck
wow,removed,maybe theyre jewish thats pretty insensitive of you
wow,removed,search for honorbuddy and you will probably find their forum
wow,removed,what utility are you talking about i just listed quite a few utilities that brew has what are these amazing utilities that all the other tanks have as for m theyre represented plenty in high m considering how few people play monks let alone brewmasters try thinking for yourself or playing the class instead of sucking reddits hivemind dick sometime
wow,removed,by living in welfare countries in europe
wow,removed,well sucks to be a retard
wow,removed,i said wasnt please dont change my words and no i was not trying to invalidate your response but since you answered like an ass to a simple comment then yes i now am invalidating your response in my reply i wasnt being passive aggressive i was being aggressive because you were being aggressive to me not being max level makes your answer useless because you dont know what youre talking about i dont ask advice to level i dont ask advice about life to old because they dont know what theyre talking about i wasnt flaming you for not being top level but because you were not max level theres a difference but you obviously thought that i meant you had to be and ilvl because thats the kind of retard you are exagerating the words of another to serve your point even though all you are doing is spewing shit in every direction you can have your opinion about monks and i can have the opinion that i dont give a fuck about the opinion of a level
wow,removed,i went an entire month without getting a single upgrade from mythic dungeons because nothinf was fucking dropping suck it up and get over it
wow,removed,examples of buying accounts method ttpwwwwowprogresscomcharactereutarrenmillsurarxd serenity httpwwwwowprogresscomcharactereutwistingnetherashenpubble memes
wow,removed,this is an awful lot of text to say we got caught cheating
wow,removed,they arent going down to less schedules anymore they have to maintain alts and do wq on all of them
wow,removed,hi bythog remember last night when you pmd me a woman who is actively having a miscarriage right now to tell me to get the fuck over my miscarriage in case you dont remember i have a screenshot of it here httpimgurcomaexbsx i just want to make it clear that you will never post on reddit again without me informing the community about this pm i feel strongly that the community has the right to know what an insensitive monster they are getting advice from this will continue forever enjoy it and if it bothers you i would suggest that you just fucking get over it have a great day
wow,removed,posts like yours are wow general forums trash i would hate to be a wow dev and see comments like yours you should feel bad
wow,removed,what i used to work at blizzard you tard
wow,removed,i really wonder what it is that drives so many females into cosplaying willing to present their bodyparts in several provocative ways d
wow,removed,oooh i can influence the itemlvl laaaadeeedaaa which is shit for at least half the classes because itemlvl means fuck all when sometimes teh secondaries are worth more than the main stat fire mages and shadow priests say hi you get gear so fast you should shut your trap and think for a moment getting gear fast when when youre fresh the last thing you get when you want to do in time is gear that is suited well for that level of performance
wow,removed,rofl did he just say a majority of the player base with no fucking actual proof to back that up we cheated but here is a lot of other things that players dont like to make our cheating not look as bad fucking russians
wow,removed,it may be on par but getting that high of ilv gear is far more difficult then mythic raiding
wow,removed,you should google bell curve
wow,removed,i get it you are a casual so you dont believe every fucking person i know got his first legendaries in about myth runs most sit at around now and still have if it would be person sure rng is fucking rng but its literally every fucking person in top raiding guilds confirming this most i know stopped farming myth and only push for once per week since its completely useless to farm anyways but hey at least they pushed the dropchance for everyones first legendary so nobody feels excluded puke
wow,removed,and you can buy mythic raid carries that still doesnt disprove my statement that getting a is far harder then current mythic raiding
wow,removed,women
wow,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
wow,removed,opposite here i muted all but voices and played forth eorlingas charge of the rohirrim and such stuff
wow,removed,you must be a woman you complained got offered a solution and now youre basically saying nah mate id rather bitch about it and fix it
wow,removed,if the computer meets the system requirements then maybe it should sure let me define potato computer a potato computer does not meet system requirements this is because it is a potato
wow,removed,thats the most retardest answer to come up with hey retard what about alt that you already discoved it from main dumb fuck
wow,removed,the word im thinking of is pussy it usually is but i appreciate your effort
wow,removed,we wouldnt have wow without everquest i know there are some mmos before it but it was the one that started it for me countless hours grinding and brutal corpse runs eq was special wow stole a lot of its thunder upon release and even before really i was a minor player in one of the top eq guilds and we all received early beta invites as a guild and we had issues getting people to log back in to eq raids wow improved on eq in almost every way for the average player it made sense and played really fluidly compared to eq there were no instances early on in eq only one raiding party got to kill the dragon that week my guild was even guilty of killing a dragon permanently and cutting off access to a whole tier of weapons for the rest of the server you could lose all your gear you could lose your levels there was risk and real adventure in eq the quests were great but never user friendly i miss the feeling of accomplishment the epic quests and camping lguk for days granted when you got your mask or sash but i dont actually miss the hours required to do those things it was hard for most classes to even grind exp without a group at high levels and there wasnt a group finder you actually needed to foster relationships and curate your reputation as a good player to get somewhere in the game there were so many cool things in the eq endgame but few players ever got to see some of it and that is where wow experience is different it isnt designed for hardcore mmo gamers it is designed so that all of the content is accessible to a large number of people ie anyone that wanted to experience it that said wow was much more eq like in the vanilla days
wow,removed,lmao avg with a padded scorpion parse is something to show off
wow,removed,for real its and eq is still running and had a lot of new players come back for the recent time locked progression servers i have been playing for the past few years again and the newer servers have pretty strong player bases would be interesting to see him come in and get in some ears about tlp servers for wow given that vanilla wow has been such a hotbutton issue for a bit now
wow,removed,tldr excuses and excuses average numbers dun lie its ok though stay shit with your controller just dont spread the bullshit that it is even close to as useful as a keyboardmouse
wow,removed,oh youre still going on about that rofl as if i would link logs public do you need to see other peoples log to try justify with a controller fucking kek
wow,removed,le is that way good input scrub
wow,removed,that wasnt my point at all i am mainly complaining about the massive difference in time spent for gearing i am not complaining about getting shit on by people with better gear rofl your reading comprehension dipshit
wow,removed,i messaged the moderators also these rules are more like guidelines than actual rules
wow,removed,yet from top comment you downplay the viability of the addon when making videos saying oh its only for casuals and lvling
wow,removed,in what way is tich challenging move occasionally to the other side as dd move occasionally to the other side as tank move occasionally behind the pillars kill adds thats not exactly a challenging fight imo
wow,removed,players want to make anythingincluding gearing for pvp harder and grindier are u fucking delusional
wow,removed,classic wow cinematic lel
wow,removed,now make him suck your dick
wow,removed,kill stealing cuck elf
wow,removed,and you had to post that here because karma
wow,removed,it isnt a bug you moron its a restriction put on the encounter so people cant just tag and go about their business elsewhere in the zone if you die and release and dont make it back to the boss in time you arent contributing are you
wow,removed,by that logic a shitter is competitive as long as the guild carries him the only people who are fine with being ish percentile are shitters
wow,removed,nah bruv a disabled autist trying to arguing for playing on a controller is more entertaining just like why people goto the zoo to laugh at shit eating monkeys lool
wow,removed,co worker implying he has a job and a steady income he mist be a drug addict
wow,removed,not possible on spellblade either
wow,removed,ye normal was pretty much pointless but sadly enough hc took us the longest of the first because people prefer to backpedal
wow,removed,we couldnt afford to have our melees sticking on auriel during the arcane phase and i think during fire neither were going with man or smth like that so we had many many in there performing horribly parses when activity is given i myself am the main tank nighthold is fairly easy honestly only trouble we had is positioning on guldan that said we arent there yet on hc
wow,removed,only thing you proved is that controller players are scrubs thanks
wow,removed,lmao ret paladin one of the strongest classes in nh and you do at holy fuck
wow,removed,it clearly says in your rules section that they are more like guidelines want me to quote it for you
wow,removed,this isnt true top players in the world couldnt solo lich king until around tot except for maybe dks and paladins the average player couldnt solo until they were geared in soo and even then its probably not really the average player
wow,removed,this isnt true top players in the world couldnt solo lich king until around tot except for maybe dks and paladins the average player couldnt solo until they were geared in soo and even then its probably not really the average player
wow,removed,shit post
wow,removed,hey gayz anybody of you wann be gay frendz wif me i watched gay porn today en hc and akktsidentäly pulled lol but i didnt cum but i was no mad d
wow,removed,uhm not a long time ago the general consensus on this sub was along the lines of lpt if you cant find a group that will have you start your own now the top comment in this thread is calling these people morons fuck off alright i mean sure the dude could specify not leading need boost or some shit but fuck off this god damn sub
wow,removed,for mythic this is the case it is not the case for normal or heroic
wow,removed,predictions for how many more of these qq threads pop up in the next week over
wow,removed,yeah probably most of us have a lot of raiding under our belt even tho were quite casual now everyone has been raiding since like tbcwotlk with some vanilla raiders aswell i guess that kinda helps
wow,removed,why does it matter if you have the robes with kjs trinket
wow,removed,so you excuse wod for having the same raiding content for over a year i certainly didnt excuse wod learn to read before calling someone delusional moron
wow,removed,utrollabot citrx
wow,removed,please guys feel bad for me i suck at wow
wow,removed,insect animal cruelty how retarded are you
wow,removed,giving stuff away for free to people that dont deserve it and showing them that they dont have to work to get good shit this socialist garbage is ruining our country and the stranger that did this should be shot as a example
wow,removed,i hope your comment is a joke and you arent actually a socialist pos
wow,removed,raises them from the dead and enslaves them or are you seriously the type of mental midget who thinks people will freely choose to kill all of their friends and family because welp im undead now better join the faction the sought to steal the power of eyir to make more valkyr to make more undead to gain more territory to bring death to the living as the forsaken are so fond of saying not to mention her penchant for using biological wmds
wow,removed,no he was a tard kid i bet i have more exp than he has and with me the group would not wipe
wow,removed,my first tiger was named niqqerslayer ah the memories unleashing ol niqqerslayer onto inferior races in the old av best times of my life
wow,removed,i came to wow from guild wars in vanilla and was blown away by things like fishing and leather working thinking that i could fish up food for my pet and craft my own armor from skinning animals that i killed
wow,removed,everyone hates the old beta login screen blizzard turns the left demon degrees fucking masterpiece stupid fucking wowfags
wow,removed,the comments on this post are an excellent way to point out how fucking stupid the majority of players can really be not even able to handle reading very basic information nor being able to do very basic maths and people somehow think what these people say about class balance and what the game needs etc is totally valid hint its not its just as flawed and idiotic but because you know less about class balance as a reader compared to basic maths it looks more correct im guessing armory glitch but who knows
wow,removed,why does she pretend to be ginger
wow,removed,not to defend botters but with honorbuddy you actually enjoy looking around yourself look at surroundings fight boss and animation and you can look at other players etc lol rotation
wow,removed,has a njtribf for the month of june to see if i can try to get a desktop to play it with you guys and mistyped on your side of the road to get a second car so i can get tbh for you
wow,removed,remember that time you shut the f up me neither ☺
wow,removed,jesus christ how pathetic
wow,removed,there are lots of software hacks and whatnot which can make it so the whole world is rendered and you can see as far as possible obviously its like fps httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnztyvebsghc
wow,removed,nobody cares kills and
wow,removed,giving br opinion on anything is never a good idea brazillians are universally hated in video games almost as much as canadians this is akin to saying that hitler enjoyed the new warcraft movie its like you want people to avoid seeing it
wow,removed,i agree its simply not the same botters in wow are just shortening the time they need to spend actually getting the gear or levels so that they only play at whatever level they want be it gear or otherwise while cheaters in ow are putting themselves above all other players with the use of the cheat it would be like if somebody on wow in pvp had whosyourdaddy on while botters are just taking shortcuts hackers are putting themselves at a level that they couldnt physically get to
wow,removed,if youre a girl act normal and keep it to yourself where possible
wow,removed,l
wow,removed,so just because its hotfixed in doesnt make it any right eg gay marriage is legal but that doesnt make it ok
wow,removed,putins trolls did it

wow,removed,what a tool crybaby man up stop running to authority complaining and bitching if i was that guys gm and you complained to me id tell you tough luck get good and stop asking for carries
wow,removed,what retards are upvoting this rthathappened bullshit
wow,removed,i honestly believe theyve watched too much game of thrones and felt it would be a good idea to copy the white walker theme to dks guess what dks arent really white walkers and the playerbase doesnt want to be one either the rotation changes they did were good both specs are fun to play the lack of movement on the other hand is horrifying
wow,removed,youre retarded tanks are way more viable this expansion than they have been in years if anything they need nerfsor removal that role is a crutch that encourages skilless pvp
wow,removed,do you really describe things as spicy and feel confident about it a u t i s m
wow,removed,a bunch of different reasons which cause some contention in guild but mostly it was to get away from the issues deriving from people having to get carried through a raid and also the inevitable i want to change my class issue the problem is when you get to a certain level people want to be in the raid and to minimize the other issues of players sitting out we had to play with a minimal roster the amount of minmaxing in vanilla was absolutely absurd down to the amount of buffs youd carry to raid learning nights food buffs that you could stack but it was just part of all the giant issues you had back then there are sides to the naxx problem on one side specifically the four hoursemen it was arguably one of the best designed raid encounters on the otherhand the requirements to do the boss werent congruent with how raidsguilds were normally formed it ruined many guilds top guilds would poach the main tanks from lesser guilds and they wouldnt be able to do the encounters without their man tank and those guilds would collapse other top guilds like mine werent able to sustain the turnover to even attempt the horsemen at one point i think we had geared tanks we were horde no paladin tanksnot even sure that was a thing then but that still wasnt enough to satisfy the requirements another huge raiding issue was that horde lacked any httpvanillawowwikiacomwikiblessingofkings but we had windfury for our melee dps the amount of safety you get from to all stats wed joke that alliance players raided with players while the horde had i even went so far as to make a post on the elitist jerks forums outlining how they could fix a lot of raid balance issues by just introducing paladins to the horde side of which i was almost banned from the forums anywayi digress no alts because it just snowballed into other issues horsemen was the only part of wow that this ended up biting us in the ass
wow,removed,idk man you post in raltright about your white male teen victimhood you tell me
wow,removed,lol stop being so fucking stupid americans herp derp i cant scroll for an answer
wow,removed,its a charity in a way for both parties you use your key and they carry you through it because theyre an organized group with good gear both parties get extra chances of loot theyre doing it for the extra chance of loot ap and legendaries
wow,removed,is it only max level i just started and im still deciding where my boost should go and id rather get the stuff on my main in any case im leveling a lock from as ive played the game on and off for years but never had a max level char of my own that i started from new

wow,removed,the vocal minority of the give us legacy people are just like the tumblrina sjws you cant bend over to them theyll never be happy
wow,removed,damn ive seen some dick sucking on this thread but this takes the cake
wow,removed,someone saying they like girls doesnt prove theyre not gay i know its hard to believe but people can feign interest to fit in or put up appearances
wow,removed,fagg
wow,removed,why not
wow,removed,somebody posted on the video update thread it sounds extremely close to what he has on
wow,removed,so i am downloading the alpha legion client httpimgurcomwhgjrdy but my battlenet isnt flagged weird oo
wow,removed,you and everyone else on whatever server good luck finding a raid group thats not lfr
wow,removed,i felt it a little so i resubbed yesterday alt after minutes and sent in a support ticket for a refund dont fall for it bros
wow,removed,you are both pretty fuckable
wow,removed,those are full mythic locks you idiot
wow,removed,also heres his patreon if youre interested in supporting him httpswwwpatreoncomgitgudguidestyh
wow,removed,look at the duration of the fights
wow,removed,seeing as were on mythic im not a low level player
wow,removed,whatever you say fаg boi
wow,removed,tich is for nobody
wow,removed,yeah its fucked
wow,removed,make an alt on a precata private server just to do all the quests then get back on retail and run through the postcata quests
wow,removed,there is one in stormheim in legion
wow,removed,havent played since so ya very long time shut up politician whore
wow,removed,you have nothing better to do thn copypaste different shit together wow sucks what can i do about it just talk im not playing it so shut up smart man knowing everything
wow,removed,you cheated and lying here wont really solve your problem there is an appeal process though blizzard csbut their watchdog software is accurate so yeahfilthy botter
wow,removed,filthy botter supporter
wow,removed,a to hold you off until the comes out at the end of this year
wow,removed,pretty sure private servers are against tos
wow,removed,id recommend you read the sub rules
wow,removed,no against the law and rules go away
wow,removed,maybe if youre a poor loser without a job
wow,removed,dont make baseless assumptions jew germans are supposed to be better than this
wow,removed,want to experience legacy servers there are plenty of wow private servers that have full time paid devs along with fully scripted content for each of the expansions the cherry on the top is that you dont have to pay a subscription fee a server that i use has a fully functional version of wotlk exactly how it was on retail no donors with op gearstats no lfr or any of that nonsense just good old fashioned wotlk with a large population
wow,removed,you could easily build a pc for around that could run wow at max settings or just about any laptop will run wow at low to med
wow,removed,what part of they gave them more attention than they ever deserved and likely chose to not continue contact after nostalrius poor conduct is so hard for you to understand
wow,removed,well the law does it doesnt matter how much your feelings are hurt or how much you want it and yet i will play vanilla wow and blizzard can go suck it the law is not a law of physics it isnt omnipresent the law and blizzard can go fuck themselves
wow,removed,agreed people should grow up but i cant control that
wow,removed,why should blizzard have the need to reply blizzard is a titan of a company why should they go out of their way communicating to nost who enacted upon their copyrighted material they should be thankful they even got a reply from blizzard blizz clearly has intention of releasing legacy servers especially with legion being so strong which would soak time and resources that could be put to releasing more content for other games they dont just have game development team just sitting around waiting for something to do
wow,removed,yeah that blizzard guy mustve been pretty busy anyways do you own blizzards stock or something dozens of your comments that clearly state blizzard angels nostalrius guards in auschwitz you have no insights you have no data but holy fuck do you know every fucking thing about this case from every side
wow,removed,the people working on nostalrius cannot be this stupid to expect blizzard to do something regarding legacy this quick the way i see it nostalrius doesnt want to be the head of a most likely lost cause and put in their free time heading this legacy concept the announcement is just for them to dip out now because only an idiot would expect a result this quick
wow,removed,blizz was kind enough to not sue their asses like they did with the scapegaming admin now they probably will
wow,removed,there is nothing valid about this i am sorry but you are retarded
wow,removed,so the idiots over at nost in addition to mark kern are doing a great job of making sure official vanilla servers never exist and unsanctioned illegal servers get shut down on a regular basisnice job what fools clearly they care more about being famous than actually helping the community
wow,removed,man i love bullshit percentages of the pop will play legacy servers thats amazing that you know that for real though look at runescape they made a server and it has just as many players as the main game if anything blizzard is afraid of too many players being on the legacy servers because it will be a huge slap in the face to their current devs
wow,removed,hmmm think i know it better than you buddy judging by your post history wow chat on the other hand is a different kettle of fish i generally frame my level of grammarspelling to my audience
wow,removed,haha nice another random rwow subscriber replying to one of my comments on something they clearly dont know anything about a great deal of people have obviously heard about nost since once this whole thing started its been talked about on here been written about in news articles and numerous youtubers have made videos discussing it and yeah i dont think it would stop anybody from buying legion right now but i know that blizzard knows that if they did release private servers in the future some people wouldnt purchase new xpacs because they would be playing legacy
wow,removed,exactly i dont think blizzard went into the meeting with any intention of actually furthering the conversation it was more along the lines of this server only got popular because wod sucks lets just shut these neckbeards up and everything will cool off after legion
wow,removed,that is so insanely self involved of you lol you flat out state what people want on the other hand being a private server player since their conception all of the friends i made through pservers including myself have been paying customers since vanilla wow we even all bought legion most of them are still playing and generally enjoying it today why create such an obtuse false dilemma lmao
wow,removed,because the people who actively played nostalrious only played it for the

wow,removed,brazillian servers should be perma quarantined from other ones
wow,removed,so you do something illegal and start private server company including their ceo not just some lawyer decides to meet you you talk whatever stuff you didnt or cant reveal but possibly something about you taking a role you dont get reply during the period where they a released a new massive expansion b were preparing a lot of content as evident by blizzcon cpreparing for their annual event blizzcon they mention every year that they spend time on bcon of course thats what they are telling there is no knowing what communication actually transpired you decide to make an ambitious tweet eventhough you didnt get any replies you need attention huh and you release your code to another group and then to public that maywill a force people to start anew in elisium as no db movement was mentioned fuck you to your own people b divide the legacy community by spawning more servers elisiumrestarters and other server restarters since people hate elisium fuck you to the whole legacy community c encourage more people to make servers uncontrollably even if their fork doesnt mean much with the feel and bandwagon they imply fuck you to blizzard well done nostralius you know i am one of those who could try legacy i understood why blizz doesnt do it but i was impressed by nost and i signed their changeorg at this point they just destroyed all credibility and respect they had in my eyes blizzard now has every reason to go full commando plus they alienated their own audience dont believe me read the comments on their site seriously what the fel
wow,removed,try the freashstart sever they will be hosting
wow,removed,just speaking from personal experience but servers were pretty good or at the very least quite enjoyable
wow,removed,again they expected blizzard to let them work on something without being employees of blizzard and without somewhat of a team to watch themhelp them blizzard wont slap their logo on anything and let some ragtag team of private server devs work on something they would release without bringing them in and teaching them what they need no rofl they wanted blizzard to set up their own servers with the code they already have blizzard cba and now they can go fuck themselves
wow,removed,bbut my social anxiety
wow,removed,you have to do a full zone because thats the fucking content in the expansion jesus christ the baseless qq
wow,removed,youre retarded
wow,removed,more like of the wows subscribers want it lowest for wow and highest for nost
wow,removed,finally a smart commenter everyone in here is picking sides so many comments saying fuck nost etc etc why just let both coexist you americans and your divide and conquer politics
wow,removed,httpvyrovnanyrozpocetczbfvdddoqjpg nsfw
wow,removed,the amount of blizzard dick being sucked in this thread is off the charts fanboysyou just cant reason with them
wow,removed,grow up i know america is all about divide and conquer but you dont have to be just live and let live ffs grow up
wow,removed,im sorry but are you stupid its a serious question just because you give someone attention at one point in your history with them does not mean you cant ignore them at another by your logic if im in a relationship with someone and then i abruptly end things with them with no communication and they attempt to contact me and they receive no response thats not ignoring them since we interacted in the first place thats how ignorant youre sounding right now understand that words have meanings and their meanings matter depending on the context theyre used in did blizzard ignore them from the jump no did blizzard ignore them ever since yes and thats the reason for them saying theyre being ignored if anything this shows that blizzard did it just for a pr stunt and is unprofessional as generally when youre talking business with someone you dont end on a good note and just cut off communication
wow,removed,what a dumb comment absolutely substance why even reply at all if you have nothing to say just to seem smug especially when youre deadwrong
wow,removed,i like how you believe nostalrius to be a completely infallible source of information as to whether they were still stonewalling this or not
wow,removed,nostalrius begins ends
wow,removed,always this fucking rose colored glasses argument you cant think of anything better can you some people prefer old school mmos with a big active world and more focus on community instead of just pressing button for dungeon queues if you cant understand this then youre a fucking retard i dont even like vanilla that much but people like you trigger me so much idiot
wow,removed,because the very immature acting of nostalrius makes them a believable source also months around the launch of a major expansion is nothing for such a large company
wow,removed,blizzard has the switch to kill the entire private server industry all they need to do is make a promise even if its a year from today let people know you are actively doing something people are begging for them to do so what do they do instead come up with different types of minigames social media integrations and microtransactions while making sure to bully every halfdecent attempt at fulfilling the vanilla void cockroaches
wow,removed,this whole thing has been discussed into the ground
wow,removed,ahem let me get my text ready mhm just gotta set up my keyboard put a little cologne on hmmm ok ready shut the fuck up about stupid legacy servers
wow,removed,god damn it are we really going to have to put up with post after post about this again
wow,removed,nobody gives a fuck about legacy servers over here we are interested in playing a current game without glasses so rose tinted you cant see any colour but red go post this in another shitty subreddit
wow,removed,nobody cares go play your shitty vanilla
wow,removed,please stop beating this meme to death please
wow,removed,nostalrius are good guys irrelevant the ip of wow is held by blizzard and no one will blame them for enforcing it now my actual thoughts about this i dont really give af blizzard wants to do their own legacy servers just dont make it affect the current retail version and im good some guy wants to do his own private server have fun dont whine to us if you got hit with a subpeona now can we return this sub into discussion about retail wow and how valtrois is best girl
wow,removed,how do i achieve good loot and stable connect
wow,removed,an art is also in the legally wrong and we are seeing a push back on how widely accepted it is hahahahahahahahaha no
wow,removed,pretty uneventful life then
wow,removed,i use vent mumble discord i wont join a group or guild that asks for anything else the community has pretty much decided on discord ill be damned if im going to have voice programs on my computer
wow,removed,you all can bitch and complain about legacy servers all you want fact of the matter is that me and many others are still going to play the classic game we love so much arguments about how the game has improved over the years means nothing we know what changes have been made and we still dont care we are playing a completely different game at this point the private servers offer something blizzard wants to ignore so its their own fault if subscriptions are lost as a result people will play whatever game they want to play no one cares about the legality of the matter its as simple as supply and demand blizz can attempt to sue whichever russian or european server host they want but nothing will come of it nost closed their own doors so as to parlay with blizz and well blizz said fuck off and now we have classic wow back see you all in azeroth
wow,removed,love how you missed the fact that he only has earbuds that cant be used as a mic on regular pcs also what a retard raid leader with his price gouging comment apple doesnt set the store prices all in all pretty autistic encounter but you were supplying at least half of the stupidity
wow,removed,you are just straight up retarded
wow,removed,because there is no other way to play what you want to play
wow,removed,to do us all a favour and play in traffic
wow,removed,only retards do that
wow,removed,yes i wouldnt understand a complete retard like you to understand it but yes it is your statement is like saying jaguar should never introduce an older version of their cars even as a tribute because it would mean their newer cars are shit if you cant see that my first statement about your character holds true
wow,removed,one of my favorite comments by some autist neckbeard about ion i think he comes off as disingenuous condescending and foolish it is very clear that he isnt a very good public speaker as the most recent blizzcon showed unfortunately for him not all of blizzard actually agrees with his ideas but they cant go out and publically say they dont my guess is that he has views that are quite different from where the game is heading but because of pardo and chilton returning to work on wow hes basically being drowned out which is why he comes off as fake
wow,removed,visit rwowservers nostalrius is returning
wow,removed,its not bad pr i think blizz did exactly what needed to be done fuck these nost goons who think they can push around the bread and butter of wow
wow,removed,the problem with quotes on the internet is it is often difficult to validate their authenticity lololololol newb abraham lincoln
wow,removed,blizz meets with nost people say blizz pretends they dont exist blizz is in charge they can do what they want and if they want to work on legion and not host legacy then thats too fucking bad

wow,removed,no need to be defensive you little shit people do a wide variety of content and thats their prerogative the fact of the matter is though youve only done content so far that doesnt require much work as such the rewards are going to stall as soon as you want to put in more work to do higher mythic more mythic higher raids your ilvl will follow

wow,removed,for higher keystones a good player bad player i dont care what spec you play provided you know the mechanics you could have a yr old kid playing a tier dps with poorly optimized gear getting out dpsd by someone who plays a tier dps spec with properly optimized gear ilvls lower that knows mechanics well i dont really like this what spec is best talk because all it really does is impact negatively on other specs youll get some try hard idiots going id never take x to a m because i read a thread on redditsaw some logsread a guide saying their bad in reality each class is viable some specs have an easier time putting out aoest damage than others some have more cc than others in the end what it comes down to group composition and specific situations a smooth run full of players knowing what theyre doing is infinitely better than a group of top tier dps that dont know what theyre doing

wow,removed,thank you for your submission urhaelo it has been removed from rwow because we dont allow buying or selling posts but you can try posting this in rwowmarket a small subreddit dedicated to this kind of thing read the full httpswwwredditcomrwowwikirules if you feel this post was removed in error please
wow,removed,beta lag hehe xdddd
wow,removed,i love threads like these because i get to pull out the most unpopular serious suggestion ever its something ive been thinking about ever since i on rwow last year make endgame free for everyone this unlocks the first raid tier and all pvp you pay for all the content that we currently refer to as the expansions leveling and questing content before you totally dismiss this as lunacy hear me out wildstar is introducing their version of the paid boost and players have been debating the merits and pitfalls this very wowlike system what blew me away in following the conversation were the many openminded voices proposing the idea that at least in wildstar maybe it should be the other way around endgame ie maxlevel raids and pvp aka multiplayer content should be free while the contentrich meat of an expansion ie the questing the lore the singleplayer aspect of leveling should be the paid content this is super counterintuitive but it would solve many problems that wow has today the constant need to update old zones the pacing going out of whack with each expansion that is piled on the staggering of players across very distinct experience levels and distinct versions of wow the sad sideeffect that it is more efficient for a new player to rush past the lore and questing because unlocking endgame as soon as possible is the only way to experience what wow actually is mindlessly grinding alts is not the point of an mmorpg the incredibly primitive and userunfriendliness of locking you into a class whose gameplay and mechanics can and will change throughout each expansions leveling content now imagine if everyone started in suramar with a level character ready to start world quests and the first raidtier but had to pay to unlock all the broken isles questing content access to level dungeons and zones alternative cosmetic gear which is what questing gear ends up being anyway items and mounts and all the profession minigames which is what professions are lets be honest etc
wow,removed,cool maybe you should practice instead of making art and crafts so i dont have to sit in a man with three retards and one other guy that barely knows what he is doing all day
wow,removed,its really weird to me that you have to hedge your comments solely because the dude youre responding to framed the entire idea in the most adolescent fedorawearing way dont let the autists hold you down
wow,removed,yea youre stuck with it
wow,removed,i actually have terrible experiences with gms this is going to be a long post but it shows how lazyincapable gms can be i think blizzard support is one of the the worst ive dealt with in gaming theyre so hit and miss and will argue with you over something they cant do rather than do their job and actually help i had the heriloom ring from dalaran fishing event that got lost over the years probably in the mail i put in a good tickets to try and get it recovered i kept getting told we cant do anything blah blah finally got a gm that was willing to help and did hisher damnedest to find it unfortunately they couldnt so i refused to accept it and made them stay with me for hours while i searched out myself to prove to them i owned it i finally ran across a achievement master angler of azeroth that i had from that was later changed to place in patch so since i had the achievement before it was changed it proved i had got first place in kaluak fishing derby so after all that they finally gave me my ring it was a really aggravating experience since i had to find information i wasnt aware of my friend had to put in probably or tickets in before he got a gm that would help him recover his misplaced servo arm he got from naxx trash in vanilla he got the typical we cant do anything blah blah they always claim they cant see that far back which is rubbish i told him they was full of crap and to just keep putting tickets in till they got a gm that wasnt lazy finally he got a gm that literally found that it in mins and sent it instantly its insane to me how of the way gms will go to argue with you rather than help
wow,removed,not human for pvp
wow,removed,sounds like a bit of a bug in regard to the catchup mechanic he missed hours maybe that happened at a point which gave him a day research timer on his next level
wow,removed,holy shit stop projecting your problems onto others
wow,removed,its not possible simple maths line up exactly with my first character i got to max level roughly hours after launch on eu according to my research ill have finished at am on january which happens to be exactly days after eu launch
wow,removed,ok like i get what they did can be wrong but really
wow,removed,doesnt work you need to be multiple days behind the theoretical maximum to start catch up source got multiple characters including ones leveled the first week stuck a few days behind the character i first leveled
wow,removed,its not ak levels behind but youll start getting the same day research time once youre within days of the theoretical maximum source got multiple characters including ones leveled the first week stuck a few days behind the character i first leveled
wow,removed,thats false or i wouldnt still be multiple days behind my first leveled character on characters that were only leveled a few days later
wow,removed,my second character hit between three and four days after release and never got any day researches
wow,removed,your data fits the expected data perfectly from what ive observed over the last months you generally have lower research times until youre days behind a character that started research the first day youre pretty exactly days behind at this point
wow,removed,no one fucking cares what is with these type of posts lately
wow,removed,werent the warrior class hall quests bugged and required more time than everyone else
wow,removed,i almost did the same was reloading my ui and everything then i decided to check how many i had already
wow,removed,are you afucken retardyes
wow,removed,so youre basically asking people to gear you up and pay money for that privilege too
wow,removed,no one is going to pay you to play with them you should stay on private servers with that kinda attitude
wow,removed,you could go out and earn gold to pay for game time yourself if you dont have anything better to do
wow,removed,go back under the rock you crawled out of
wow,removed,correct i hit at the day the game came out and have never missed time on my research and will be done at am monday i leveled an alt to the following weekend as well at one point i let my research lapse on this toon for a short time hours and managed to gain about hours relative to my mains research basically theres somethign wonky with timing triggering a catch up where you only missed a few hours but get a day quicker research i was never sure if it would be possible to actually beat people who hit day to because of this wonky behavior for the record i have toons at and of those are all
wow,removed,feminist screaming equality d
wow,removed,that seems like the catchup is working it speeds up the ak time then slows it to normal as you approach current ak levels my lock that i started immediately and hit days in is with days left i forgot to pick up research a few days ago so fell behind a couple days my druid that hit weeks later is and my dk that i finished a week after that is about i think
wow,removed,mine is day away which is prob the fastest one could get it done
wow,removed,time to find a job then
wow,removed,oh shut the fuck up who cares
wow,removed,stfu guy i just saw someone post this for another game
wow,removed,that probably made it worse as if he just had it himself that could have meant he had convinced his guild to let him do something really stupid and to just watch a la wanna see a magic trick i shall make flame leviathan disappear but him handing it to someone else implies planning involvement and all so less stupid what the hell lets go vs actual malicious planning well as malicious as exploiting is at any rate
wow,removed,literally a year old joke by a chick makes virgins laugh saved you a click
wow,removed,what was it im curious what could incite such a strong response
wow,removed,old mastery was changed in wod to the earth bolt things and echo of the elements just gave you two lb charges iirc sorry bud
wow,removed,its actually possible to have in hours i have leveled to to start maxing ak on release day took me roughly hours and i get my in hours its impossible to have by now i have actually been going for realm first and shit and been checking who while leveling first person to hit was like hours ahead of me
wow,removed,still not nearly the worst leader appointed by thrall
wow,removed,
wow,removed,is your wife hot
wow,removed,try playing on a blizzlike vanilla server best wow experience ever before they ruined the game with obligatory daily quests and flying mounts
wow,removed,i dont disagree im just saying that youre talking down their game without needing to just be a bit more considerate that a lot of these people like their game and they hear stuff like this game is garbage now all the time they hear it from each other and they hear it from previous subs every time i visit here theres undoubtedly going to be posts i come across that say that
wow,removed,i will buy her and i have a permit that says i havent molested any of my adopted children so i can molest one without consequences ahhh god really did it right when he made rules

wow,removed,video game spiders arent real spiders and your girlfriend needs to get the fuck over it and see a therapist
wow,removed,lol you autist that doesnt change the fact that its a good feature
wow,removed,heres the problem as it stands doing lfr as a stepping stone is the worst possible thing you can do it easily makes you a much worse player look at it now fucking lfr archimonde you can sit there with chains on you with zero consequences most people dont even know that mechanic exists then you step in normal moderaid lead tells you when to break chains and youre confused because wtf are chains lfr should share lock outs with normal meaning you can do normalheroicmythic but if you do lfr you cant do normal for that week and vice versa why is this good because it keeps the people who like lfr likereally how in lfr and the people who are always considered elitists or toxic mostly because were tired of carrying every fight out of lfr winwin
wow,removed,you cant have it both ways what you are proposing is already in the game and look how well it worksits awful blizzard has even started incorporating their own pseudo dbm warnings for abilities to try and teach people mechanics move away from allies etc do people do it no why because there are no consequences its facerollable theres no learning because theirs no gain im a mythic raider and i dont follow mechanics in lfr because i cant dieim literally damn near invincible in lfr and its just not worth moving for lfr in its current state makes you a worse player than if you just started fresh with no bad habits on normal mode you solve the issue one of two ways you keep lfr the faceroll shit hole it is now and just say heres your free gearmaybe of you move on to actual raidingthe rest of you can go crush world quests now or whatever you like doing and theres no reason to not want to do lfr if thats your end game but blizzard never intended lfr to be anyones endgame or you increase the difficulty not as much as normal obvbut you up it enough where its forgiving but if you fuck up too many mechanics you diewipe etc force people to learn this will cause exactly what its always caused see archimonde for example people bitching because they still cant kill him at stacks of determination because of the raid is used to being able to jack off while raiding or people bitch because they get kicked because i can only imagine they are playing without a monitor with dps or whatever since we all know blizzard is never going to bring down the hammerlfr is going to stay the face roll shit hole its always been any time they even had it slightly difficult and lets real lfr is only difficult because you are at the mercy of others not because of the boss etc theyve had to nerf to due to colossal outcries
wow,removed,you have literally replied the same stupid comment to me like times now i cant tell if youre trolling or just stupid at this point
wow,removed,bruh i have phobias too but i dont break down and get paralyzed because i realize that thats retarded
wow,removed,i just came here to see content i dont want to have this bitch score of next to my name make it something you have to opt in to bam now you only see it if you went through the trouble to turn it on the reason to do lfr is for people who are afraid of well the people in this thread look at all of this hate i am getting just for an idea that is the kind of hate that is in the game and keeps people in lfr who could be great raiders

wow,removed,how retarded do you have to be to think its something blizzard can solve
wow,removed,youre an idiot
wow,removed,great another whiny kid who doesnt know what a ddos is

wow,removed,they chose to f you know what no youre pretty thick and i dont care enough
wow,removed,true
wow,removed,where is the boss then right now i cant find him
wow,removed,we got the first last night and i fistweaved the entire time averaged and was top healing in the raid by around at no issues whatsoever i think were in a great spot as a class my raid is not particularly geared or experienced and everything went really smoothly
wow,removed,exactly i found myself throwing out double mists every time my tea was up and rarely having to cast another ability i really enjoyed it hopefully the rest of the fights arent too bad
wow,removed,i was there in vanilla and it was intuitive just listen to the gamespot review of it
wow,removed,i use a shit ton of macros for everything plus vuhdo for raid healing plus weakaura giant cooldown trackers for the spells i care about that being said last night was my first time raiding as fistweaver so im sure ill be doing a lot of finetuning as the expansion goes on heres a httpiimgurcomwnxdmanjpg
wow,removed,i use tiger palm blackout rising sun typically thats all i have time for before i have to swap back to toss some heals out of course i start with rising sun if thats already off cd that macro on the first spell slot does all three nomodaltshift
wow,removed,normal healers i believe the others were druiddruidpally the fact that i did more healing was probably due to the healers as im pretty confidant those particular bosses could be done with easily and it just so happened i responded faster to damage than the druids id imagine
wow,removed,well of course everything should be taken in context im not trying to say fist weaving is the only way in every difficulty just sharing experiences
wow,removed,and this is how i know youre autistic
wow,removed,im not sure how saltypathetic you are but if you went digging in my comments you realized that this is the first time i legit got in to wow not for a week like that time or when i played my booster pala for that matter beacuse inposted a month ago aswell im sorry that you dont know how to earn gold but no need to spew bs about me buying my accountgold im playing for a month i leveled a shaman and a dk both trough invasions i have tons of gold im sorry you are jelous and im asking advice on how to lvl if you dont have an anwser gtfo instead presuming shit

wow,removed,latin america servers you can safely deduct ilevels from every player from those servers they are usually fucking useless or fucking shit
wow,removed,because blizzard has now realized that communicating with the community is still just as toxic as it has ever been because of assholes like you so theyre very careful with what they say not to say too much the people behind blizzard have to deal with the fact that anything they say on this matter will be torn up shat in and showed back down their throats before they can even consider and discuss any of the feedback they would get
wow,removed,tomorrow at is a stress test on vanilla private server elysium before the nostalrius relaunch check it out

wow,removed,i am not sarcastic only an actual autist would lash out like that
wow,removed,you need to get some fresh air coming from the guy whose throwing a fit over someone copying his video game characters outfit
wow,removed,autism is a real condition and people who have them usually conduct this behaviour if you are getting offended by reality i am sorry but you are retarded me being asshole thoughtless or allegedly using ridiculous words do not affect the facts this is a clear demonstration of moral highground fallacy it is fitting that someone like you would fall for that
wow,removed,trump
wow,removed,youre just jealous of my week aotc xavius
wow,removed,youre a fucking retard if you think its a client side connection issue
wow,removed,it matters because youre saying you took it easy and it had no effect on your experience so i need to know your progression to know if you play to clear or if you play to kick back sounds like its the latter which is why it didnt affect you the way it did me which is why i wanted to know it means you cant relate because you play on a lower level and dont care if you dont get content done until it isnt challenging anymore i have to assume here because you arent providing prog data like i asked which people generally only do when they arent progressing and are embarrassed
wow,removed,people like you make wow a miserable experience like what would you have them do kiss you ass and wait for you to decide if you want to sell it for the like its pretty clear if something is an upgrade or not so if you know you dont need it and someones just being honest and admitting their weakness by asking straightforwardly hey can i have that if youre not going to use it how in the hell does that come across as rude like did you forget to take your midol for your extra strong period
wow,removed,million raiders can you shut the fuck up you retard pvp boosting you have a limited ammounts of players at glad you dont at raiding anyone that isnt a crying bitch cares about them sharing it doesnt hurt us at all

wow,removed,y the fuk u do dis husbando s
wow,removed,this is the stupidest meme ive seen in awhile it stopped being funny weeks ago and now its just a bunch of retards thinking theyre hilarious and giving the zoo more grief because you cant tell the internet what to do have some empathy
wow,removed,all i can foxus on is the crying woman in the background
wow,removed,idk if people would the pvp scene usually tends to be bgs with like stuff or arena world pvp usually always ends up being a little less entertaining because often times theres less skill involved i used to post a lot on wcm and still spend a lot of time there but ofc i cant say this is the case but this seems to be the general thought about it i recently started getting back into my youtube channel as simply because i am enjoying wow enough again to make content about it you can check out my ill trade you a sub lol also from what i had seen there are a few classes that just seem broken as fuck in wpvp with legion
wow,removed,judging by how fat your wife is shes probably just mad she cant eat all of that in one setting
wow,removed,how old is your wife
wow,removed,
wow,removed,you will die soon
wow,removed,wife may already have it
wow,removed,lmao sure dude we you say
wow,removed,the fact that he justifies eating shit food by prefacing training hard makes it pretty obvious he is lying i know plenty of ppl who might chill out on the meal prep for a couple days and eat out but i dont know anyone who works out trains mma who would purposely go out of their way to eat shitty food if you had the time to go buy ramen you could have easily found healthier and better tasting alternatives i dont give a shit what he eats its when he tries to pretend that he works out and trains mma to justify his shitty diet thats when i have to say something
wow,removed,yea true passive agressiveness is also one of those insecurity things you do you bud lmao
wow,removed,iama fat guy
wow,removed,has nothing to do with porn or making fun of rp theyre criticizing you because youre engaging in a sex act with an actual other person jesus youre fucking dense
wow,removed,i dont understand why its considered humerous to suggest sitting infront of a computer for hours on end eating crap food while your fat wife misses you ugh this is gross man thanks for reinforcing the shit stereotype
wow,removed,thats your wife man i feel sorry for you
wow,removed,she thinks wtf this is too healthy food

wow,removed,are your counters really small or is everything in america supesized just asking out of curiosity everything looks massive compared to what we have here like those cans and the maruchan noodles boxes
wow,removed,price will fall for the first week or so i think due to demand greatly increasing which will drive the price of a token down economics so sell them in a few weeks once the demand for them dies out
wow,removed,an american could probably get through that shit in matter of minutes
wow,removed,price drops assuming supply is the same but as weve seen in the market the price for tokens has been dropping which means the supply on tokens is about the same so the price is dropping
wow,removed,spam
wow,removed,ill be staying up anyways even though i cant afford the expansion right now

wow,removed,its psychological the amount of loot per mob killed varies sometimes youll get a solid gold or two the other times a little more or less sometimes theyll have one grey two greys no greys but you dont get any less loot for killing ten at once vs ten one at a time
wow,removed,no im just fucking sick and tired of entitled pricks like you expecting everything to be like a steam summer sale and get everything for nothing if youre so fucking desperate to save what are basically pennies why not try begging over on rlootcrate for a spare key code or why not wait until the black friday sale so tell me is your gf ok with you being such a cheapskate

wow,removed,thats funny my experience with the latter is that the group is full of retards with decent gear who think that just because they demand three chests its magically going to happen then they fail to manage pullsstunsinterrupts and wonder why we arent making the timer in my experience the best groups simply set a reasonably high ilvl requirement to even view the listing and say nothing at all about how pro they are or how many chests theyre expecting
wow,removed,to be fair hes under a lot of pressure being the presidentelect isnt as much fun as he thought it would be

wow,removed,ill break it down for you we are playing an expansion that is the literal second half of last expansion im not talking about continuation im talking about tanaan was withheld at the start to push broken islands into the second expansion as such they did a piss poor job of actually developing legion as it seems like they took what was there slapped the diablo devs on it which puts in a horrible spot and we have their spin on the expansion all they really did was port over the bounty system and make world quests in which i feel like they created then slopped them in for the leveling progression add in a few cut scenes and a small main leveling quest tree and theres that then on wards to mythic system its just a bland copy of diablo great rifts added to dungeons what really annoys me is how depleted keystones give gear and mythic cache in your class hall if you dont beat the timer you shouldnt get a reward imo then pvp holinka needs to be put on other projects and got the fuck off of wow hes ruined pvp since hes taken over and im honestly pissed how as a dev he did nothing at all to combat botting last expansion until the end people will say hes not in charge of exploiting but if youre the dev of pvp you god damn make sure they are doing something about it rather than let it just run rampant with aff locks ruining high rbgs i could go on but now ill answer the question the removal of justice points and valor was a massive mistake if they are going to leave them gone they should have put a damn curious coin at the end of a mythic dungeon the rewards there are stupidly expensive and i have like coins after months and have never missed an emissary cache pvp really needed a or more achievement by now they also need to finally scale up the old pvp world instances from past expansions and provide marks of honor for winning them this new currency is literally as fucking stupid as the curious coins are because they are scarce to the point you dont care about doing them arenas have really been ruined by broken comps and worthless classes and the removal of rbgs are just pointless anymore to do because most pug groups just do win and break up i rarely see groups in the finder anymore compared to last expansion and i enjoyed rbgs battle pets have really pissed me off as well they slopped together the system for them and did little to no balance for it until nerfing pets this xpac theres been no real reason for people to get into battle pets other than wishing they could do those wqs when they need to for an emissary cache personally i think they should have had balanced them more at the start and did a monthly tournament or something similar to the darkmoon faire i was hyped up for withered army training because i thought it was going to be a fun clone of the treasure vault from mop it was not and it boggles the mind why they didnt put the medium and large chests back in when you were finished and just put gold in them or the toys that dont drop also why are there no achievement points in withered army it couldnt have been that hard to add them based one score amount of withered in the end and time they got lazy as fuck is the only answer to that alts everyone knows how ak and ap suck but they are fixing that soon it shouldnt have been this way as most people rarely have time for their mains let alone trying to grind up crap for alts weapons they already put the time in so ak should have been given to alts from the start alt rep is just something that sucks as well theres no reason why they didnt put in a mop rep token that gives alts double rep as gaining rep just sucks this expansion and the rewards are pointless by the time you get exalted youre not going to need the ilvl item because youll have better from mythics i could go on but wont i think things that take effort are enjoyable but if youre telling me i have to continue doing pointless things over and over in the hopes the rng gods give me a non shit legendary or upgrade that is titanforged its not fun i have done mythic in the past few months and am currently trying to finish up toon slots on my account up to for chances at the love rocket this feb my overall goal im guessing is going to be getting my alts to to just run missions on the app for gold normally in the past id play them but im not going to waste time trying to get ap so im not behind if we merge again with more realms it sounds like we are ill probably fill up realm slots with dks and get them to do more missions until the next expansion
wow,removed,just msg me their names i wanna harass them ingame
wow,removed,did you get the names of the people in the pug you ran with you should share their toon names and the servers they are on at least this way some of us can avoid them put them on ignore or something to that extent yea pugging is a real problem best to run these things with your guild or friends
wow,removed,for anyone on mobile it basically says guild group master loot we get all loot you get exp and its a h en raid group
wow,removed,i got today on the hpal
wow,removed,my evidence is my personal experience my gut feeling which are coming from common sense a thing humans developed over the years you rely on perfect situations and mathematics which will never ever occur in reality apart from that you are seriously pissing me off with your tryharding to sound like a smart person fact or feeling you got bullied hard as a kid
wow,removed,you deffenitely got bullied as a kid possitive
wow,removed,if you dont understand how boss fights are variable then you should probably step back from im here to bash munkky soapbox so youre not using a customized apl on a boss by boss basis do you even know where the default apl comes from are you customizing your apl to match individual boss encounters based on whatever job you have during that encounter is your sim character tanking drakes on mythic cenarius the adds or the boss what are your kill times is your dps high enough to bypass phases have you customized your simc boss to match the boss abilities and damage patterns i doubt you are
wow,removed,its just one of those things ive come to let go of from old wow the game is not what it used to be and its not trying to the design philosophy has made a throughout the years and its striving for a different experience legion is a good version of the game it is today and im loving it nostalrius is coming back in a few days so i have that to tickle me in the way old mmos did in the meanwhile i just enjoy the current game in the way it has to offer trying to accept everything it has lost for what it has gained i will always miss the sense of community but being able to join guilds cross server and being able to play with anyone is a very nice feature too its all about accepting that the game has changed and to try and approach it in a different way looking for what it has rather than what is has lost
wow,removed,this guy isnt listening to what anyone else has to say he just downvotes and doesnt reply pretty pathetic
wow,removed,sounds like me retard tank retard hunter ffs i am doing more dps than x and still healing get out of the god damn poolsfire omg this tank is taking too much damage omg learn tactics before you go harder difficaulty they are probably some of the things i am shouting to my self mostly in dungeons
wow,removed,use fyi announcement when reminder is banned
wow,removed,ヽ༼ ຈل͜ຈ༽ ﾉ raise them dongers raised check out for more info
wow,removed,i agree slow tanks should not be tanking if you want to fuck around twiddling your thumbs and looking at porn on your monitor just play a hunter like everyone else that does those things i dont know why youre getting down voted for speaking the truth its unfortunate that a majority of people on reddit are fucking retards
wow,removed,you cant idiot
wow,removed,that
wow,removed,thundercuck is better
wow,removed,you can still value your leisure time sure it might not have a direct monetary value attached to it but leisure time is a luxury that not everyone has if youre going to play wow anyway and dont play specifically to earn enough gold for a token then getting enough gold through normal play saves you a month one lucky drop or a few hours just playing the game can net you more than enough gold to pay for your sub every month as long as youre enjoying the game youre absolutely playing for free youre being a pedant
wow,removed,your a retard if dont use serenity to start the fight and instead try to pool chi and then use fof and then wait seconds to use it yeah i can tell you dont play it much you dipshit
wow,removed,its awesome you can copy paste but that info is for during the middle of fights you dont fucking start off the fight jacking off waiting for fof to be available the second time god youre a tool ask babylonius during dps weekly fuckwad
wow,removed,this rotation seems better than the one i listed
wow,removed,hes not right though
wow,removed,seems like its tougher to explain this to you us folks how this works since you can earn token from just playing usually this is not the case in any other region everywhere else you have to invest lots more time into gold gathering either way my point is clear no matter what you do you dont play for free the moment ingame gold can be transfered to irl you are spending priceless time to buy it
wow,removed,quest money and cache gold with greys unless you play hours a day its not enough for token anywhere outside of us
wow,removed,despite not being completely inaccurate they are completely accurate oversimplify the value of time to a dollar amount to you americans
wow,removed,lmao good odds that the players were bad if it took you hours to get through it please stop blaming the class if youre too stupid to realize that as a melee you cant have uptime on the boss and kill it then you shouldnt be in such an environment in the first place it took our group of unprepared melee range healer idk one and a half hour wipe count maiden opera moroes horseman curator shade hello flame wreath mana viz if youre stupid and cant understand mechanics then yes you will wipe over and over again if you are ranged then you get a free pass on a few stuff as a melee you just need to understand that you need to sacrifice dps sometimes to deal with mechanics thats just how it works i really really hate these posts
wow,removed,mixed race husband halfbreeeeed
wow,removed,no we are talking about time to get gold to buy token you can do that with just playing normally on us servers you cant anywhere else you are completely missing the point my attitude was proper from the get go and all i got was ignorant and stupid replies
wow,removed,heroic and mythic plus is surely not an hour of play one daily heroic as a tank or healer is not everyone can play as one one daily mythic or mythic is an average of one chaos crystal not everyone have enchanting why is every post you make just chock full of ignorant bullshit irony is real
wow,removed,if you read and remembered any other comment he said you would not be saying this right now
wow,removed,nice counter argument thats completely unrelated on topic bro but nice to see another ignorant american got triggered by what i wrote
wow,removed,like i already said times now third there are plenty of ways to earn money without holding down a job or doing overtime which again is completely besides the main topic point yet you people so desperately cling to it
wow,removed,heal role is most important if you go deeper than heroic you have three dps role and you can win even if one is dead today cleared half of karazhan with retard warrior with small dos and frequent deaths if healer is a noob than all the party in trouble now you need not only to heal but to move too it require skill and steel nerves to see how your party is on but you control it and heal heal with no worry or hurry it require good understanding of fight and what and for how much can hit mythic is hard kara harder
wow,removed,theres this thing called agility do you know what it does it gives attack power among other things do you know what it scales with it scales with ilvl do you know what it gives better ap than mastery youll get there eventually
wow,removed,i bought it from wowtcglootcom for no ragrets i fucking love it
wow,removed,youre trying to make a joke but it isnt a good one

wow,removed,there isnt an alternate universe in the world of warcraft for azeroth but the movie and the games tell slightly different stories about the same events not like theyre the same world just different timelines more like theyre retellings of the stories just adapted to movie or to game like in game of thrones theres not alternate universe westeros its just our world having two versions of the series because of different medias
wow,removed,you sure it was and not
wow,removed,its not a br server your racist jerk
wow,removed,the dangers of grouping with brazilans ftfy
wow,removed,httpwwwwowprogresscompveusazralon how is this possible
wow,removed,you are in whichever expansions content that is appropriate for your level vanilla tbc wotlk cata pandaria wod you arent going to miss anything just the ceiling has been increased from level to level
wow,removed,must not have played with too many russians then stereotypes exist for a reason
wow,removed,to wipe her ass with you mean like with a cloth
wow,removed,its funny how you prefaced that with youre delusional but then go on to claim to have inherent knowledge of hillarys intentions and if youre gonna talk about someone wiping their ass with the constitution lets talk about the banning of everyone of the muslim religion a blatant and obvious contradiction to the amendment which involves freedom of religion
wow,removed,im so glad you and your daughter are ok i was so worried while reading halfway through i also totally relate to your experience with online relationships ive met many great people throughout the years since i joined in vanilla some were great some were nasty some were downright part of the worst experiences of my life but some were also the best things to had ever happened to me just because its online doesnt mean its fake thank you for sharing your story
wow,removed,press ws while douple jump for an extra high jump
wow,removed,suprised you didnt include a donate here please link fishing that hard for help
wow,removed,im so sorry to hear your story and id like to help if i could i dont have a ton of money but i do work in it if you havent managed to piece a computer back together by this point id be more than willing to look around the shop and see what we have as far as spare parts i cant promise much a beat up old chassis a couple sticks of ram some spindle hard drives and an old nvidia quadro basically the opposite of top of the line but id happy to send you what i could
wow,removed,maybe you should go back to your safe space in your garrison since such a reckless design oversight has caused you such emotional distress
wow,removed,my online friendships lasted much longer and formed much deeper connections than the friendships i had during high school and even college i think theres just something about the virtual environment as long as youre both adults you dont have to worry about stupid petty drama
wow,removed,atleast you were a good player and didnt stand on firethats more important
wow,removed,another example of those annoying pvpers who cant see past that massive shaft growing out of their forehead
wow,removed,if you join please use my link for sharing
wow,removed,they just promod sylvanas to warchief and im willing to bet thats a permanent change the alliance have been pretty jewd out of quality heroes though
wow,removed,from uk made many friends abroad from wow and have travelled over therehad them stay with me still in contact with a few guys from sweden went over in feb this year who havent played for a few years dont forget the online relationships require an active input just as much as offline ones
wow,removed,must be an american
wow,removed,op i have some extra parts i might be able to send to you to get you on your way to your new battlestation i would honestly cry my heart out if my pc was destroyed i put so much love and affection into my rig that it would kill me also post your story up at rpcmr there are probably others like myself that would love to help you out
wow,removed,if you have a go fund me for a new rig i would be more than willing to drop some money on helping you get back to your friends and family because thats what we are if you strip away all of the factions the trolling the slight jabs and humor at others expense the gaming community as a whole is family and friends i know that is the case for me with a lot of the people i play with online
wow,removed,and they changed it with
wow,removed,a bunch of perverted deviant neckbeards furries virgins and pedophiles running around killing demons theres something you dont see everyday

wow,removed,please get this left wing trash out of here dirty political election most brits killed by a farright activist holy shit can you be more biased
wow,removed,murder part is not true that has yet to be proven what a fucking joke leftie trying to use a murder to campaign smear also guessing all your friends are dirty lefties just like yourself considering the leavers won so suck on it
wow,removed,people have been assaulted and a politican has been killed by a farright proleave eu activist stopped reading there how is it the jo cox murder related to brexit and why should it affect it the murderer was one person and how do you know it wasnt a false flag
wow,removed,based on your comments fuck off
wow,removed,i dont understand why that film didnt go the same way s stuff
wow,removed,once it was removed it was gone forever man lbrsstratholme baron side were such a blast back on the day ummm dude just jump on a private server all that is still very alive and well the more people that do it the more blizzard will start to realise shit there really are a lot of people that do want it
wow,removed,repeating myself in this thread a bit just because its totally a message i thinks worth spreading you should totally jump on a private server all the vanilla aspects are still very alive and well organise groups by communication sharing boe gear with each other because the communities are usually small and there isnt an active economy running to instances it feels like the old wow because it is the old wow and its available right now for free i highly recommend it anyway having a blast
wow,removed,psycopathic pedofile irl confirmed
wow,removed,i mean it wouldnt have been crazy to draw the parallel
wow,removed,sorry not transferring to a pve server not for the insane price blizzard charges for an automated system draenor and now legion have exhibited the worst of ganking unlike anything ive ever seen in prior expansions go vote for killary because it seems your sense of entitlement to being a jackass is in alignment with her potential presidency
wow,removed,thats an odd disposition id hate to see how you react to racism or domestic violence responding in kind to vitriolic comments is somehow a measure of ones character scary
wow,removed,look at these blizz fanboi cucks down voting an accurate statement about how low blizz can be about something as petty as old content farmers skipping annoying shit
wow,removed,god forbid i sometimes feel the itch of speaking up against people spamming this place with reposts should just stay silent and swallow everything all the time right cause that has historically always led to the best possible results swallow shit and dont speak up have a nice life
wow,removed,hes not posting as a traumatic event that deeply hurt his feelings and made him rethink his life you dont know the context judging by the top comments being triggered retards who dont like being called kid mebe u haev autesm xd the fact you fail to understand this ironically makes you appear to belong to the autistic spectrum fuck man in any case theres no reason to be a douchebag if this kind of post doesnt interest you just ignore it the fact you waste so much time on it shows you actually crave the attention that your edgy comments might yield crave it like you guessed it a little kid the fact that suggesting you dont leave a pug which wouldve benefitted everyone involved assuming everything went smoothly because of the most asinine insignificant pair of comments is edgy is the real joke here
wow,removed,this is a nice beta we have here
wow,removed,what the fuck blizzard go fuck yourselves
wow,removed,its because this was a simple appearance to obtain and warriors were cucked because blizzard fucked up when people asked blizzard are you sure all the hidden appearances are obtainable and triggers are working blizzard said yeah everything is fine go look for it it wasnt even locked behind ak my fresh got the appearance this just shows a lack of internal quality testing such things shouldnt make it to live
wow,removed,bullcrap and heres why on yogg in ulduar a tentacle comes up from the ground and grips you before legion hitting tab one time would target the tentacle that has you gripped so you can kill it now no matter what i do tab targeting seems to target yogg or sara or some other tentacle not even fucking close to me so tab targeting sucks and isnt as good as it used to be
wow,removed,do i have to record video do i have to get you in discord and destroy you with evidence how dare you appeal to authority
wow,removed,tab targeting isnt as good as it used to be i just gave you an example with the yogg fight in ulduar anyone who solod yogg then and now will know that im objectively right tab targeting still sucks six ways to sunset savvy

wow,removed,if i cared about karma i would act like a nice little cucked sjw who only has nice things to say about others and gives responses based on niceties and not reality crushing criticism
wow,removed,lol how bout him going in without looms on a character he will still be slow and you cant do jack shit about it a dungeon can be maned when both players have looms add more and its piss easy stop complaining and play you aint losing anything however would go to that queue goes to another players playing arent a problem i feel that its ridiculous that people complain without need sometimes leveling my alt im doing times the damage of other dpss and still someone complains someone else is afk and needs to be kicked im doing enough dmg to clear the dungeon let it go you dont need more damage you need to stfu and play the damned game
wow,removed,yeah op we all totally get it but just in case someone didnt get it you should probably explain it to those retards

wow,removed,if anyone has more than the one for i would also appreciate it if someone could pm me a code thanks
wow,removed,are you ignorant about the subject or just a shithead in general the interface slider max doesnt zoom out nearly as much as the console command would
wow,removed,yeah lets totally listen to someone who not only uses their gender for views but also knows nothing about the game all of their content is just rehashed shit from other youtubers
wow,removed,how much does she weigh
wow,removed,no problem reddit has invented something clever to help you out on the right side is a so called searchbox its really fancy just type in some context related words and youll get a list of possible matches
wow,removed,fuck i hate the wow community can you bitch about trivial shit any more please
wow,removed,hello everybody im jordipro and yes im a fucking ninjapuller because someone like to ninjapull on my raids so i make the same on others easy neverdied just try to broke my raid again and i will find the best mode to make you legal damage

wow,removed,slimgur into the trash it goes tbqh smh fam
wow,removed,
wow,removed,and lastly you are retarded
wow,removed,dont get on your high horse and act like it came out of left field
wow,removed,
wow,removed,you should address reactionary tendencies of sjws also
wow,removed,glad to see u admit ur wrong
wow,removed,read the patch notes asshole
wow,removed,varian dies at the start of legion
wow,removed,getting butthurt over fat comments on the internet doesnt mean youre a decent human being either youre just insecure about being fat
wow,removed,its probably because youre retarded
wow,removed,for clarification yes this is a private server i also play on retail but this one serves as a nice little place to rp and make sets they also allow you to learn whatever spell there is in the game and this is it is so much fun to use nothing stops it
wow,removed,theres an artifact quest in legion that takes place in ulduar in the mimiron area my guess is that this is whats causing this
wow,removed,it actually does and he along with you is retarded
wow,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrqreudpuklm
wow,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrqreudpuklm
wow,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrqreudpuklm
wow,removed,you mean that guy who mathematically cant win the nomination anymore
wow,removed,awww did someone criticize your favorite raid asshat
wow,removed,holy shit i can smell the neckbeard seeping out of this post
wow,removed,says the fucking retard
wow,removed,if youre hordeeu you might wanna watch my twitter were going to be announcing something in the next couple weeks
wow,removed,hey there you wouldnt need to include the alt code on the twitch lottery once your name is chosen youll queue up to the group in the group finder and thats how youll be invited to the group
wow,removed,right shame on you but seriously i know that zelse is always looking for alliance carriers particularly for his hour run on saturday benefitting st jude you can see him on twitter at
wow,removed,well we dont sell we only choose winners through a twitch lottery but if you dont want to wait on rng might i suggest posting on your servers forums
wow,removed,see you tonight good luck
wow,removed,yes you only have to be able to listen to our instructions its a very easy download and requires little information you can even join now and read the text channels if you want to poke around you have to actually join a voice channel it doesnt just dump you into one when you join the server
wow,removed,yeah we have someone who is taking up the mantle of euhorde but im letting him do it his way and im not sure if that includes reddit you ought to make a twitter account so much of the wow community happens there
wow,removed,if youre a level ushorde then you qualify
wow,removed,ive said before everyone plays this game for different reasons if progressing through heroic hfc and getting your moose mount gives you a sense of pride then thats awesome dont worry about how other obtain the item and focus on your own achievements someone getting carried for the mount doesnt diminish your efforts in any way and in fact i know of several moose winners who had previously been terrified to step foot into a raid who are now killing heroic bosses regularly focus on yourself and quit worrying about others there will always be people who buy carries for things that other people work hard for that will never change
wow,removed,good luck to you
wow,removed,see for alliance runs
wow,removed,i need to update the twitch we use only discord now
wow,removed,you sound really uneducated on how the game works yes your garrison gives you mythic gear after youve killed mythic bosses if youve killed mythic bosses its very unlikely you are still in need of the moose mount
wow,removed,good luck
wow,removed,discord is what we use for our voice comm during the runs
wow,removed,no thats not how it works i could argue why not go to another reddit if you arent interested in wow still not sure what the point of your original post was
wow,removed,time to read the honorbuddy forum salt popcorn
wow,removed,its personal loot so each player either loots gold or gear from the boss rng decides
wow,removed,lmao as someone who bots up accounts and sells them thank god they did this making fucking bank couse prices are going to skyrocket ty bliz doing this riiiight before legion when i have accounts in hibernation just waiting for prepatch probs is going to net me another easy
wow,removed,discord meets several needs in this case its a good voip service that we need to communicate with you during the run and we are building a community there to allow us to easily have access to people when we do our next thing once moose go away
wow,removed,yet another fkn ridiculous request from a fkn noob to add more shit to the game in order to make it easier go play habbo hotel u fucking moron
wow,removed,holy shit youre dumb

wow,removed,grab oneánd other variatons at this store
wow,removed,trump is really about common sense sorry you get your news from liberal cuck land
wow,removed,i use it the way i want to use it cuck has connotations of a guy being subservient to his woman like she has him leashed im ahead of you but you can keep trying to oneup me lol
wow,removed,well i found this thread like a minute after i was literally being hunted down by level characters in westfall on my level gnome so im really calm and objective about this whole issue but i dont give a shit it sure felt really social and fun trying to hide behind objects to get the last hit in while being camped by bored pvp players if youre on a pvp realm and deliberately hunt low levels during invasions go find a fucking rope and hang yourself youre not a pvp player youre not funny youre just a toxic asshole that ruins the game for hundreds of people to entertain himself and for potential downvoters im sure youd love having a dk literally sitting at your spirit healer and spamming dd on cooldown conveniently seconds to kill any low leves that spawn there instantly
wow,removed,httpsgfycatcomimpolitesinfulbuzzard seriously though fuck off
wow,removed,because rbgs take no skill and are boring to watch
wow,removed,yup and theres always retards on pvp servers trying to avoid pvp
wow,removed,convinced uzedowel is a goddamn retard if you hate ganking so much gtfo the pvp server
wow,removed,go kill yourself
wow,removed,that orc arms warrior is saurfang
wow,removed,well that is the best idea i have ever heared of better than removing jeff kaplan from diablo jeffvengence
wow,removed,probably not definitely not if autistcoi mean poodlecor ddos the servers like they said they would
wow,removed,dont feed blizzard play on private servers man for free to relive your experience the current game is complete shit and is marketed towards little kids who dont wanna put in time
wow,removed,right next to your autism diagnosis
wow,removed,you should have seen her when she got it i bet you got some happy sexy time out it tho dont lie
wow,removed,did you read the thread as i say im not saying its nearly as good a movie but its not dimwitted either and more organic than lotr in those two aspects again that a you dont know the end of the beginning the journey is what matters but anyway and b the opposition of human vs orc isnt between good and evil black and white
wow,removed,more images of him admitting to using a bot in arena
wow,removed,blowjobs
wow,removed,he meant ice floes twat
wow,removed,shhhhhhhhhitttter
wow,removed,that feel when you dingus someone into deleting their account
wow,removed,blizzard is acting like a startup publisher or producer without a clue what this game needs to be great for me it seems that many players already quit again because of this monotonous crap
wow,removed,hi im a friendly grammar bot it appears you have used some variation of the phrase comprised of although writers will occasionally use it comprised of should be avoided since the construction introduces unnecessary inconsistency and imprecision into the english language to comprise means to include or to be composed of several things it is therefore illogical that its grammatical opposite to be comprised of could mean the same thing for a more complete argument against its usage please see httpsenwikipediaorgwikiusergiraffedatacomprisedof i am a bot and this action was performed automatically if you have feedback please message utheundergroundman
wow,removed,thanks for spoilers you fuck
wow,removed,people like you are weird you getting off a video game
wow,removed,will kill wws jesus fucking christ stop it you can just use dragon kick with split and do decent dmg if not better surely better in situation with adds people behave like it is the end of the world ww monk has awesome rotation great gameplay and people will tunnel vision dps charts i know it is important but i feel like shit when playing my lock in every situation i have sacrificied sanitydpsmeaningful rotationmetaraid spotsmain what have you given i switched to my monk it is an amazing class better in everything compared to lock you just need some self relfection guys
wow,removed,it will ruin how you have another lvl talent which is completely viable changing your playstyle doesnt mean ruining it manwhile every playstyle warlock specs have is pure bullshit you dont know what suffering isedgy
wow,removed,and im talking about your approach melodramatic fuckdrama queen it is probably just a bug and you preach the apocalypse jeesus man get real
wow,removed,oh the classic i know you are but what am i i no
wow,removed,confirmed upset because you cant faceroll disc anymore disc is only for top tier players which u arent look at the amount of skill josh has in this video its so good tasting salty disc tears because they cant retard spam shields anymore
wow,removed,youre the one redfaced and angry over words on a screen buddy maybe you should get out more
wow,removed,im being fucking edgelord and meme on purpose he is being serious
wow,removed,i just got a titanforged from an emissary chest that must be rarer than a legendary
wow,removed,undocumented it is fucking ptr you retarded dickwad theyre not posting patch notes for every single build
wow,removed,a legendary and an ability are completely different things your logic is complete shit how about you submit a bug report to blizzard instead of getting on your soap box and crying to reddit
wow,removed,hes just too retarded to understand that
wow,removed,stormstrike is baseline you cuck
wow,removed,please up vote this post so blizzard has a real chance of seeing it concerned shaman
wow,removed,oh for fucks sake you are so thick if you are trying to argue that there is no measure of doing things better just do it already so i can tell you that blizzard knows how the percentages of the players playing each class dwindle thay also know the percentage of players rerolling and whether the probability of unsubbing is independent of the class they chose to play at lacunh all of those are pretty good indicators the best indicator however of ding things right is not having to state we agree with a number of the core concerns raised but dont have solutions
wow,removed,they should be out doing the class hall missions you send them on in those specific areas
wow,removed,ww complaining about any other fucking spec go have a nice cocktail of bleach and bleach and come try again
wow,removed,eh she lost to trump so i dunno
wow,removed,holy shit youre a genuine idiot
wow,removed,lol you bunch of retard whos saying animation is different deal with it hé retard bow and gun use different animation as i know polern and axe use different animation too so why are pally able to use it
wow,removed,yes because a caster bursting someone with instants is fun and engaging gameplay lmao that needed a fucking nerf
wow,removed,this wins retard comment of the day ele blast in pvp lmfao lb on a dummy lmfao
wow,removed,we dont need race bait for every single post it honestly isnt a super common occurrence in wow
wow,removed,why dont you just not tell people your trans and get over yourself
wow,removed,so basically what youre doing when joining a pug is hey im trans how about you or what rightwing guild dude what i dont usually reply to threads like this but jesus lord you need to stop attention whoring what youre doing now is worse the flashing body parts
wow,removed,i have moroes as a follower and he appears as yvelyn in the app interacting with yvelyn in any way causes the app to disconnect i have tried putting him on a mission selecting him in my followers list
wow,removed,well at this rate i want my followers to pvp for me this is still an mmorpg as far as i know and quests being done by followers would cripple the game make a lot of people angry and eventually end in casuals unsubbing because they have nothing to do when in reality they are paying a month to play an iphone game
wow,removed,yea youre right ops idea of inflicting the rest of us with his crazy step father is a better approach
wow,removed,found the shitter getting solod by a dh kek
wow,removed,maybe consider ussaurfang of the server also has dementia so he should fit in well
wow,removed,yeah if you only measure someone in one way the outcome will be quite biased that is why i never brought up the content i completed it is silly because you have literally no experience at a competitive level in it that doesnt mean you dont know what you are talking about at the end of the day it is two sides of the same coin
wow,removed,were going to build a reaves and blizzard is going to pay for it makeazerothgreatagain
wow,removed,its a travesty so with that out of the way where is jon snow located on this map
wow,removed,read my name
wow,removed,damage was pure trash the fuck are you on about stm was absolutely op when used right it needed a nerf
wow,removed,thats why stm is nerfed and other spells buffed
wow,removed,probably the very last one to get that reference naw theres still several million people playing the game that dont know any music other than whats on the radio or on their friends merch shirt siouxsie and the banshees is old enough and not superpopular enough that the probability of your typical person knowing who they are is about as likely as your typical person knowing more queen songs than bohemian rhapsody under pressure we will rock you another one bites the dust and we are the champions
wow,removed,hes locked up in a crystal prison atm guldan accidentally breaks it at the end of the raid thats when he will go from background charachter to one of the main players of the expansion follow me into the void
wow,removed,wowza
wow,removed,op youre one salty fuck about another guilds kill of a boss its pve lol no one cares if blizz screwed up and let them have a free kill this shit thread is like beating a kid on a wheelchair is ok if he fights back but u gotta stop if he aint moving
wow,removed,you must be new to blizzards jokes bear back riding seriously though do you need your safe space feelings hurt with all the problems in our world this is what you care enough to post about
wow,removed,im not the top dps spec anymore better reroll what a joke
wow,removed,what a bunch of fullblown retards d
wow,removed,currently mediocre spec maybe youre just bad mm is doing great right now
wow,removed,unless its against black men or nonhetero men white men are most insulted nowadays and white men dont really give a fuck about it but man if youd make a joke about someone black shitstorm incoming
wow,removed,lol logs for one boss not sure if trolling or retarded
wow,removed,fyi jumping in front of a train gets me a couple months off work on compensation at wages so feel free

wow,removed,sounds like you got it all planned out and hey if you cant find a willing one theres always chloroform

wow,removed,ish it looks a lot like the briefing room of kingsmen actually
wow,removed,the work that went into it which exactly some bodypaint lipstick fake ears and a wig plus chrismas clothes to get that rune thingy on the face you probably need a few attempts but the rest is done within minutes
wow,removed,obviously your guild is not semi hard core then
wow,removed,i dont think anyone mentioned wwwiceyveinscom good source for learning statsability rotation or which traits to choose etc
wow,removed,stop being a dick and or complete retard out of all the keystones ive done ive had someone leave twice once the person dcd could be intentional but i honestly dont see why he would do it we were doing great and the other time the guy who had the key was absolutely retarded wiped us times and blamed everyone else
wow,removed,i learned that the usa is the only country because all the other countries are too poor to even be considered countries
wow,removed,not playing the game is even more convenient as you dont even have to complete quests youll love it op
wow,removed,i saw avatar as pocahontas more than anything some crazy general dude goldunobtanium and forbidden love between john everyman and savages
wow,removed,sounds like you have a gambling addiction im already sick and tired of running dungeons for two weeks of the five drops ive gotten since then none have rolled to decent ilvlupgrades
wow,removed,i actually looked up his character and its even worse one of his rings is level from level i dont even understand how you can do levels of questing without finding a new one
wow,removed,yeah then you would just have a bunch of retards who only vote for thier friends for mounts
wow,removed,every time a new class comes out that can use hand swords they have updated the glaives for them to be able to equip them dks couldnt use glaives till the end of wrath wrong
wow,removed,it gets longer every day because blizzard doesnt like that pvp players have something to work for so they continuously nerf it
wow,removed,rewarding successful interrupts with a dps boost role specific buff is a nice idea i disagree there already is a massive reward in not taking large amounts of damage having to avoid puddles on the floor not getting polymorphed the healer not getting caged leading to a wipe the good players in your group not thinking youre a worthless retard etc interrupts take little to no effort for big payoff as is the fact that the vast majority of the playerbase doesnt know what theirs looks like is a failure on blizzards part that should be corrected through tutorials like the formerly mandatory proving grounds and a change to the leveling approach and the inclusion of crucial interrupts in earlierleveling dungeons warriors used to receive a damageboost every time they used an interrupt i still rarely saw them actually use pummel
wow,removed,casual raider here i agree i dont even like doing random heroic dungeons without a full guild group because half the people i get queued with are retards
wow,removed,european do it on wednesday and there are actually competent people there not just mouthbreathing retards
wow,removed,
wow,removed,gallywix is a brazillian server so it shouldnt be surprising

wow,removed,id love to see some proof of you being melee crit by a mob within your level range
wow,removed,that gives even low impact casual players all the time in the world to farm a full set of gear without ever setting foot into mythic en lol theres not going to be a single player in full gear that wasnt farming mythic en for the entire patch even then there wont be many the average lfr raider might come across one piece the entire tier

wow,removed,my little sister needs to renew her account but mommy doesnt want to pay since she says we need to buy food instead and that wow is not important my sister doesnt like barby dolls she loves playing her female tauren druid more than anything in the world and the extra playtime would make her the happiest little girl ever
wow,removed,yep thats coffee on my keyboard worth it
wow,removed,as a raid leader ill tell you that your raid leader sounds like a cuck and you should bail hes obviously witch hunting in the wrong areas such as criticizing your tanking mistakes but not the god awful dps im no ray of sunshine when i lead but i try to yell at everyone equally
wow,removed,to further support that dcma claim at my company we sell isp services to our clients and we get dozens of dcmas because clients are pirating game of thrones or other illegal movies we get the dcma tell the client to stop we get another dcma next month and the cycle continues without any legal action taken and i have been here for almost years

wow,removed,yea its not like everyone didnt know he quit the avengers and the others are now in a max prison because ironman arrested them
wow,removed,more news from the scumbags hurray
wow,removed,i still have not seen a general consensus that people want a vanilla server most people i have seen want tbc and specifically do not want to experience vanilla again im not sure if thats true the whole nostalrius was a vanilal server to begin with there wasnt a single tbc server anywhere as popular as nostralrius granted i think theres definetely demand for vanilla tbc and wrath legacy servers but for the time being it make sense to focus on getting a vanilla server and then expand to other types of legacy
wow,removed,ill let you have fun with legion quit after a month and want a new xpac you bandwaggon the fuck out of blizzard ya jag lmao
wow,removed,yea but the rest of us retards are trying to start some civil rights movement over a video game
wow,removed,httpusbattlenetwowencharactergalakrondnoobadinadvanced
wow,removed,actually competitive mythic raiders will do split heroic runs to get everyone their before mythic opens semi shit guilds who think they are competitive because they are after rounds of nerfs and whatever will be the equivalent of ringvalor upgrades will be the ones complaining they have to do lfr to remain competitive no loss
wow,removed,wrong i dont like him for the reasons he was fired he did wrong things in the past that must mean hes incapable of doing anything right in the future nice logic there well on top of everything else ive already said you said he was fired because the did wrong decisions thats all what youve said how does that make him toxic in your replies you failed to give me even one reason or example of his toxicity just dodged the question oh so youre trump hater did i offend you mentioning his name your safe space was violated the whole republican party and tens of millions of voters must be gross shitters according to you for supporting trump you are a typical sjw libtard they joke about

wow,removed,retard spotted
wow,removed,remind me day
wow,removed,replying to the same comment twice your desperation is showing
wow,removed,will your autism allow you stop responding or does it demand the final word
wow,removed,not liking something doesnt make it shit literally your only argument for prestige being bad game design is i dont want to do it but i want the rewards anyways you are literally ignoring everything else because you simply want the rewards without having to do anything
wow,removed,
wow,removed,i dont give a flying fuck what you do with your out of date materials
wow,removed,now kiss
wow,removed,ah the sign of defeat he made a typo when laughing at me in a single post out of many therefor everything he said previous is wrong i will point this out and i win just when i thought you could not be more of a complete retard you prove the world wrong congratulations maybe its word salad for you because you dont comprehend things as well as you think you do perhaps you are dyslexic would explain how you got yourself into this assblasting in the first place lmfao keep up the pseduointellectual banter i am sure someone will believe you graduated high school at some point
wow,removed,i dont honestly care if devs take my advice or not and i dont give a shit if you think i have a lack of imagination its a fucking problem that there are currently pages of single listings for materials that can stack to this is a problem regardless of whether im hitler or jesus id be fine if they let your ass burn with a change that fixes the walling problem but again thats just me im sure theyll figure something else out if they give a shit about people like you
wow,removed,suck a fat dick hows that for a context clue
wow,removed,blood elf males cis pick one
wow,removed,are you black
wow,removed,not to be rude or anything but kys

wow,removed,your claim it isnt at all simcraft is based on theoretical dps with absolutely perfect play close to no latency full raid buffs and zero movement or mechanics bolded portions are verifiably false simcraft provides a way to account for higher latency movement and sub standard play accept it retard

wow,removed,well if you randomly insult people out of nothing youre already retarded so theres that
wow,removed,i edited a spelling mistake seconds after i posted so i guess it was either you mocking a spelling mistake or an edit of one half a dozen of the other nice touch on the continued use of your buzzword
wow,removed,another question is does is bruno mars is gay does the rumor come out
wow,removed,retards downvote me cos you didnt get beta invite lol kys
wow,removed,im an idiot sorry httpswwwtwitchtvtruedusk

wow,removed,i dont play a dk on live this is new to me
wow,removed,i feel you and your confusion but do not play legion go for community and true mmo feeling and class is not a relevant factor anymore play fresh realm on nostalrius and thank me later i will get downvoted by people who cant tolerate opinion that differs from them so take a hasty step
wow,removed,mythic en about as much an achievement as finally learning how to tie your shoelaces
wow,removed,clicks is out of my way kkk
wow,removed,try joining a guild that isnt full of autists
wow,removed,youre fucking stupid if you dont know the trick to keeping your notes
wow,removed,get better friends who dont want to be carried all day problem is you and your friends the system is fine
wow,removed,what
wow,removed,what
wow,removed,get off tumblr and stop listening to twoxchromosomes the only violent crimes that women are statistically more likely to experience are sexual related onesand thats only when you disregard statistics of prisoners muggings random acts of violence stalking shootings etcmen make up the overwhelming majority of victims
wow,removed,i think i have something real to say sir you are a dicknugget tata
wow,removed,none of my friends ask for a carry or some shit like the ops you know why because they arent shitcunts
wow,removed,fuck you i would use that implication
wow,removed,both are good and viable spriest has one of if not the highest skill cap out of all the casters with ele is good dont listen to what others may suggest rotation is fluid and offers both high burst ascendance and sustained lightning rod ive managed to end up in my bracket as an ele shaman going and topping dps charts since the start of the expansion so it still comes down to bring the player not the class ele is getting some buffs and viable builds for dps icefury vs ascendance and it comes down to what you think is more enjoyable solo content id say elemental beat out spriest since we are bursty and can easily cleave down multiple mobs oppose to spriest who has to dot everything and has lackluster aoe dungeons again ele shaman beats out spriest in all instances even when it comes to boss fights unless youre running and higher with on tyrannical that would be the only time elemental may fall behind raids is situational but overall spriests will win arenarbgwpvp all comes down to player skill oppose to what class you play ive easily beat spriests while doing the pvp world quests and rbgs try them both and see what you prefer
wow,removed,welcome to wow its been like this since aotc was implemented and this far in if you dont have aotc you werent really trying for it
wow,removed,somethings not quite right
wow,removed,tbh it was getting really annoying having to put an item on sim it input new stat weights try another item log out sim it etc etc id rather it be more clear than the way it is now
wow,removed,nope not until
wow,removed,we know theres other posts about it
wow,removed,mop was probably the second best expansions fundamentally after wotlk as far as gameplay goes if youre only into the lore sure it was mediocre but gameplay wise still highly rated
wow,removed,ah i see what you did there
wow,removed,i enjoy the rng aspect of the game it keeps me playing if you knew exactly when you were going to obtain gear exactly what stats were on it new exactly what was your bis it would be boring as fuck i enjoy simming and theorycrafting and maximizing my characters potential but right now its a bit excessive simming isnt important but its a very fun way to gauge your skill vs an ai and if youre into mythic raiding and not simming youre gimping yourself if youre just a casual then fuck it equip whatever you want it doesnt matter anyways
wow,removed,vrykul for the horde could be a tribe of small vrykul or something for the people who want a horde race with straight backed males panda dudes are so chubby and goblins are well goblins
wow,removed,good think i kept all of mine for that just in case moment that were now getting equipped but if the changes are how blizzard wanted them to be ill break that wall tuesday finally
wow,removed,yeah i could but im so used to the interface and options of the program now that i fear id mess it up how different is it from the program from simcrafts site if it isnt much of a difference i may just grab that so i dont have to keep moving my head from monitor to monitor anymore
wow,removed,ah yes the glorrrrrious bag space
wow,removed,instead of new race id rather them give us different variations of the ones we already have ie the isle of thunder trolls high elves iron dwarves the wotlk tauren tanuaka or we red skinned orcs etc
wow,removed,here here i wish i could say tbc was one of my favorites because i know i would have liked it but i was a pleb in high school too busy partying and chasing tail to have time for nerd games oh how times have changed
wow,removed,i did personally enjoy the lore but whenever you discuss it with anyone and try to defend why it was good all people say is it had fucking pandas thats not wow even though we had the majority of our lorefaction heroes there old gods the sha which imo is still one of the better aberrations weve seen visual and lorewise and mothafuckin deathwings whiny kid it was all good
wow,removed,you were probably a shitter in mop thats why it wasnt fun for you name one thing that cata tbc and wod had that was fundamentally better than mop ill wait
wow,removed,it helps that it was sandwiched in between of the worst expansions as well lol
wow,removed,debatable its pretty hard to beat firelands thats one raid h tot was vastly better than firelands even with the wipes we had on rag catas intro dungeons were miles ahead of any mop dungeons even after the nerf also and both would like to say hi just had a good lol about this comment and with the added cm mode theres literally no comparison between the two but if you didnt do them then your opinion doesnt really matter lol no you couldnt pay me to quest through pandaria again thank god for the legion invasions or id never get any other classes past since you have a hard on for cata um hello vash
wow,removed,what it does bring is a i member moment now when they add in wod timewalking ill literally cry
wow,removed,its not open again until the patch on tuesday wednesday for eu youll have to obtain the blood soaked invitation to get in and get up to rank to buy them
wow,removed,they usually get released on the day of so well have to wait a bit legendary item changes are already up on icyveins for the most part
wow,removed,not being removed just nerfed as far as i remember maybe we can make mind spike work now
wow,removed,casual could have left it at that probably lol
wow,removed,yep this wednesday from you i read somewhere that the invitations can be farmed from some certain mobs in storheim but im not sure
wow,removed,i got killed by a volcano on my platform last night on a when it wasnt even visible tears were had
wow,removed,ok then reroll stop being a fotm bitch
wow,removed,those are ptr notes though official patch notes for release have been on the day of for as long as i can remember
wow,removed,i think its something with displaying aggro not sure how to do it from the wow generic interface since i havent used it since early wrath
wow,removed,my argument had nothing to do with the amount of content added in i was speaking in regards to the content that was available looking at shear number of who actually completed endgame content compare to the general population tbc and vanilla were both pretty low the game was not casual friendly at all and having an alt meant you had to nolife and were time gated to most of the content through attunements flying mounts yes are great but it is now the trend to not have them active in the start in order to see the world they added new raids yes but further to my point above how many of the active player base at that time actually experienced it lots of content a good expansion tbc im sure was great but the fundamental gameplay of each class was horrible talent trees were a thing but were all cookie cutter raid bosses were long which does not mean they were difficult looking at you enrage timers very clear you fanboy tbc a lot but if you really look back at it it was still in a broken state
wow,removed,stop asking people for their loot and this wont happen a lot of people myself included run lfr for de just because it drops for me and im not going to use it does not mean that youre entitled to my loot stop with these shitposts on reddit too not sure what point youre trying to make with these
wow,removed,why are you being this way you keep downvoting everything i type immediately and ignoring me cant you just give me something or say youre sorry whats wrong with you
wow,removed,i have a guardian druid alt literally the first tank alt ive played and at i had no problems running a so you should be fine dont be afraid to use cds and check some videosguides to know the best routes
wow,removed,check wowhead for which quests youre missing as part of the achievement also some parts are locked behind rep wowheads guide is pretty good for suramar
wow,removed,youre still fanboying tbc though i was comparing all expansions to each other and you flipped it since you lost the argument you need to chill the fuck out you low life piece of shit see i can try to sound like an internet tough guy to relax
wow,removed,ah so what do they have in place besides legacy of the void for that tier
wow,removed,this your question gets asked hundreds of times a week and this is the best and only answer playing something thats best right now means down the road it wont be as good and if you dont enjoy playing it youre going to have a bad time anything can be viable as long as you know your strengths and weakness of the class you want to play
wow,removed,no i just called you a shitter because you didnt give me any game mechanics just amount of content this show your complete lack of understanding on how to gauge end game content gonna drop this here because no sense in arguing with someone who doesnt have any relevant end game experience from other expansions
wow,removed,do not do this this is a douchebag move youre stealing their lockout which im certain they are going to extend to try and get cutting edge seriously dont fucking steal lockouts
wow,removed,normal drops so should be safe at expect pugs to ask for though heroic pugs are going to be trashcan for a few weeks so not sure what people will be expecting
wow,removed,i was already finished
wow,removed,you asked for someones loot did you not im not going to go through your whole screen shot trying to get internet points from this community because you felt the need to post their reaction after they decided to ignore you just stop please stop
wow,removed,lol facepalm im done here wheres the ignore function
wow,removed,being that theyre theyll most likely be extending it to get cenarius and xavius before cutting edge goes away if they extend it and you do only a max of people can enter the instance so if you try to zone in with your ninja group while they are you just fucked them over do not do this for the love of god dont
wow,removed,it wasnt my favourite literally everything youve stated about cata were the reasons why people hated it stop
wow,removed,it will only allow people in total we had a group try to ninja one of our mythic soo raids back in mop when we tried to zone in only of us got in because there was another group of trying to summon other people
wow,removed,pretty reasonable tbh might be on the low end of ilvl requirements for pug groups though dont remember what ilvl it drops but i think it was around normally lfg asks for the same ilvl that drops from the raid but guess well see thank god im in a guild cause the pug life sounds horrible the last few expansions
wow,removed,and your argument was to call someone retarded what are you grow up kid its gonna be a rough life for you
wow,removed,real mature of you cant come up with any constructive criticism or argument call someone retarded good on you your parents raised you well
wow,removed,not sure about the name thing since its only happened to me once and i just changed it to something else but for the explosion damagealuneth ability it may just be tooltip errors
wow,removed,damn thats gonna make multidotting a lot easier
wow,removed,til that calling someone a shitter commonly used across this subreddit all other subreddits wow forums trade chat etc is the exact same as calling someone retarded guess its free reign now
wow,removed,theres typos in some of the loot tooltips for nh gear as well seems like a dime a dozen this expansion
wow,removed,yes and a hard cap of right now
wow,removed,and now assuming someones age is also the same as calling someone retarded some inconsistencies in the approach of reviewing reported comments i guess using the word retarded is ok on this sub then from what i learned today i have the evidence to back it up now
wow,removed,or just be less shitty so now your on my side as well but fine since youre the boss man on the interwebs here have a good one
wow,removed,this made me laugh
wow,removed,wow are you ever a lazy fuck
wow,removed,you are fucking awesome spilled my coffee all over the keyboard
wow,removed,paging uaraxom can you help these poor souls
wow,removed,people here absolutely hate brazilians better luck somewhere else
wow,removed,im not sure what the problem is but please blizzard link ragnaros to these servers thank you
wow,removed,i actually think of this is a language barrier not really im brazilian and tend to avoid other brazilian players they are toxic by nature always trying to find a way to get better with little to no effort to the cost of others just like most brazilians in real life
wow,removed,then buy a good computer then and stop wasting other peoples time
wow,removed,the hell crawled up your ass if you dont like the thread just fucking leave why do you feel the need to attack the op just because you dont like his thread are you mentally handicapped
wow,removed,no its not most brazilian players are toxic even with other brazilian players im brazilian and i saw some terrible shit on all games
wow,removed,i hope they get this fixed soon i fear players from nemesis moving to other servers and losing the very clear tag that indicates low skill and high desire to be carried
wow,removed,keep them on brazilian servers that realm tag sets expectations on communication ability and skill level
wow,removed,i think you were downvoted for two reasons first you didnt seem to grasp the hyperbole attached to the statement and jumped right on that sjw train second for such a standup individual taking the moral high road as you readily did you were awfully hypocritical in your admonishment of his comment is an insult to retarded people seems like you cared more about correcting someone to make yourself look better than you actually do about offending the mentally disabled
wow,removed,yeah can you guys do more about the destruction of the amazon seriously
wow,removed,we know our players are considered toxic by many i have literally never had any remotely kind of positive experience with any brazilian player ever the only cause i would support involving them would be to perma ban them from any server outside of brazilian ones that said blizzard should stop dicking you over and give you a clear answerfix to the issue
wow,removed,brs have ruined so many online game communities that i find it hard to sympathize
wow,removed,downvote me if you want but when see any member of my party is playing from a brazilian realm i leave before the dungeon even starts i once had a brazilian healer refuse to repair his gear in a m
wow,removed,which to be honest is the other reason i decided not to transfer
wow,removed,tldr ai mofio
wow,removed,brazilians ruined all mmo experiences with their stupid huehuehue i have no feelings for you
wow,removed,you guys dont fool me none of you are brazilian brazilians dont know english
wow,removed,then the cries of jajajajajajajajaja were suddenly silenced
wow,removed,while were talking about br realms can we build a wall between the us and br realms
wow,removed,hue huehue
wow,removed,im game for brs enjoying the game as long as they dont end up in my mythic groups
wow,removed,the best solution is to just keep south american latin american and canadian servers all together that will give a bigger pool for you to queue with and will keep the worse type of players away from people who actually want to play and enjoy the game
wow,removed,excuse me but what does and meanwhile people are complaining that they didnt get their legendary that they want have to do with anything at all most brazillians not all ofc are ass holes and that has nothing to do with your odd comment
wow,removed,can we just forget about the gelgamacs for a second
wow,removed,youre actually retarded stop making assumptions
wow,removed,br players dont have the handeye coordination to find a druids asshole
wow,removed,for science remindme day
wow,removed,i have an idea lets take the br servers cluster them all together and remove them from the north american english realms then the worst players ive ever met in the game can group with more of the worst players ive ever met in the game
wow,removed,i avidly avoid these servers when creating groups for rbgs and arenas i have to be able to communicate and of the time i get some from a brazilian server their english is aweful we just cant play with someone who cant communicate
wow,removed,
wow,removed,ikr shouldnt there be an isis member discount too
wow,removed,httpusbattlenetwowencharactersargerastempurpedicadvanced never killed a h tov boss before this run the highest ilvl alt registered to his battlenet account is an httpusbattlenetwowencharactersargerassidepiecesimple dudes a dumbass doesnt realize the entirety of his character select is visible to anyone who wants to see it

wow,removed,flair mod
wow,removed,ill be here xd oh and dont use the level boost on a class its going to make you confused about the class you chose this way if you start new and dont use the level boost you can know your character and class

wow,removed,lmao go fuck your mom if youre a pve asshole
wow,removed,agreed i got to that and just kind of sighed and rolled my eyes and now i just skip through anything to do with that questline i dont even remember what part of it im at on my main but i dont really care im sure its for some artifact appearance or something but lol windwalker monk bro immune to artifact appearance
wow,removed,you seriously might want to go to the doctor to get tested for autism you nigger
wow,removed,probably used to be devils den gm was retarded renamed after he left and got a new retarded gm guild of retards
wow,removed,typical defensive no lifer
wow,removed,in case somebody hasnt heard the others
wow,removed,except the cinematic for guldans fight is already out illidan comes back and crushes his skull
wow,removed,honestly i hope they find someone else i really disliked the novel arthas it portrayed him as an insecure murder machine instead of thee headstrong murder machine we saw in
wow,removed,omg omg ahahahahaha so last weekend time walk event we got end of time with the dragons and platforms and rooms first room was the one where of the people run past the trash and of them agro on the way to attempting to follow everyone else this newish player less than like achievement points seemed kinda timid accidently agros the whole room and wipes us tank fuckin rages you fuckin retard let that mother fucker tank the whole rest of the dungeon only to kick him right before the last boss what a dick laughed with everyone told the monk to keep an eye out for pats next time and said thanks for the run everyone plus ya know its nice a new tank got to finish one of his timewalks in one boss and no trash

wow,removed,fuck you
wow,removed,fuck you
wow,removed,fuck you
wow,removed,fuck you
wow,removed,fuck you
wow,removed,you sure youre all their mentally son you might want to take a minute break and figure out whats going wrong
wow,removed,all i need to know is they cant afford a steady sub that is worth bucks a month doesnt matter if you are or if you have trouble maintain that type of lifestyle then you need to reevaluate how you spend your time or money being the typical sjw or white knight to try and defend some one that clearly needs help is what is destroying society you might turn the other way but some times you have to be brutally honest
wow,removed,right a simple comment about how they mishandled it is a hissyfit lol youre actually fucking retarded
wow,removed,this is similar to what happens after a female dairy cow is raped then is forcefully taken away from its newborn calf and hooked up to milking machines boycott dairy products like me
wow,removed,gives right answer gets downvoted gj morons
wow,removed,yeah but he was a character on his own right from the start and have done stuff on his own too sure he was a bit mary suy at cata but its nothing compared to the hamfisted strong character that was yrel just to appease the rabid sjw whining about the lack of female character we lost maraad who was a cool a established character to get that genderbender mary sue that will hopefully never leave draenor all her story can be resume by got carried by the player and some major characters who sacrifice their life for her because shes a useless whiny bitch who cant do stuff on her own
wow,removed,have you been living under a rock being homophobic is worse than being hitler fo realz
wow,removed,lol loser you cant make me do anything
wow,removed,the game hasnt even been out for years yet let alone shut the fuck up fuck this subreddit is full of retarded casuals its just a game guys lol
wow,removed,there is you retard there is pictures on that imgur jesus
wow,removed,i cant be asked to do minutes worth of research that would help me save about hours worth of trash pull across expansions wow dude youre an idiot ffs i need my safe space someone said something mean better post about it on reddit and circlejerk the elitist prick i dont want people to have expectations of me normal dungeons should take hours yeah okay bud
wow,removed,they said that they were going to gauge how well received the new melee animations were and then update spell animations down the road if things went well
wow,removed,you want to be a whiny douche about gear you arent going to use anyway have at it get on with your life
wow,removed,maybe i missed it but how did you change the wod garrison resources to legion
wow,removed,dae wow is dying downvote me cucks
wow,removed,i am all for helping worse or new players i just hate it though when people make posts like these and describe mentally challenged players as new or worse players like auto attacking trying to hit mobs feet away and jumping in lava this guy is a straight up retard
wow,removed,youre right instead of doing things which have a chance to give you one waiting around and crying about not having one pop is the right course of action fucking dumbasses
wow,removed,dont be shit quit bitching you fucking baby
wow,removed,that coin must be as retarded as you
wow,removed,id assume he chooses to do so because youre being retarted
wow,removed,huh what agenda i just wonder why cosplay is such a phenomenon with mostly female cosplayers
wow,removed,udavismudie is the rl tell that to his face
wow,removed,when people are fucking stupid you call them on it he is stupid so his opinions dont matter the same as you
wow,removed,first off im rude and condescending only to people that deserve it if you come at me with an attitude i will return that same attitude treat others as you wish to be treated secondly you werent just wrong you were completely ignorant of the topic at hand and spoke out of your ass you lept at the chance to prove someone wrong over the internet and the only thing youve done is prove how fucking stupid you really are lastly if i ever lose everything in my life and reddit karma is all that i have left then i still wouldnt give a fuck about it fuck off ya little shit and dont reply to me again
wow,removed,again this isnt about you this is about doing what you can because other people are relying on you if you get more joy out of doing what you want versus maximizing your utility for other people that are relying on you you are a shitty individual and likely a bad player
wow,removed,for some reason the mods started censorship and my post here is a of the post with all the upvotes it had with the time of taking it
wow,removed,i am a nolifer therefore i am entitled to what i want this is the essence of your post you can kid yourself all you want
wow,removed,which makes reading his thread quite difficult doesnt it its a bit gross
wow,removed,of course theres no reply to your comment because hes stumped
wow,removed,thats how you wish the game worked
wow,removed,doesnt them dying in lose seconds on the timer though
wow,removed,i very very regularely get declined in mythic pugs because monks arnt good right now youre so full of shit ive done pug dungeons as ww and i have literally never seen anyone say that everyone knows ww aoe is broken what is it with this subreddit and everyone pining for the community to hate their class its like a race to the bottom with you people
wow,removed,when you typed that did you really believe it would have any effect
wow,removed,when your data is completely wrong your conclusion is going to be wrong like ops was the correct conclusion is unholy needs help ops conclusion was lul unholy is shit even with bis gear lmao frost still better even with no legendaries which is completely false use your fucking brain
wow,removed,every and their mother knows how good ww is for all content atm stop sooking typical omg my class sucks nobody wants it whining stfu u are delusional
wow,removed,this is absolutely not helpful thank you captain obvious its like i was intentionally trying to condescend an inflammatory moron who cant even get their facts straight next time ill try to be a little more obvious
wow,removed,kiki kķkķkķìkìì i ììķķìujìkiìììììììiìķ iii ukkkkukukukykkkukkk
wow,removed,you talk to him like twice lol you see him several times during leveling but ive only talked to him like once or twice since getting the third relic slot
wow,removed,looking on wowhead theres one toy im missing the script no one there has reported getting it do you have it by chance
wow,removed,fuckin retards
wow,removed,how about the election hacking
wow,removed,no youre a shitty individual because you get more enjoyment out of doing something selfish rather than doing something that benefits other people you should take pride and joy in doing what is necessary to help the group succeed but you dont because you dont give a fuck about the rest of the group ie shitty individual
wow,removed,lold ye old making up stories to justify a point
wow,removed,cry harder fаggot sucks to not get carried through shit doesnt it
wow,removed,a few hundred people are you fucking kidding me
wow,removed,bullshit simply
wow,removed,stfu lul
wow,removed,lol no pleb xd
wow,removed,i thought it was obvious already the way it was but i guess common sense doesnt click in to most people
wow,removed,a black human rogue or hunter likely to have had years of experience running from cops and cant be beaten on speed
wow,removed,why are you here

wow,removed,not leaving a comment is even more convenient as you dont have to waste time doing so youll love it
wow,removed,sonot really gated no reason not to be doing the questline anyway
wow,removed,sure it is months into the expansion you have plenty of time left
wow,removed,and so i ask againwhose fault is it for waiting until weeks before nighthold
wow,removed,because youre being fucking retarded
wow,removed,because youre being fucking retarded
wow,removed,so why do you need it spelled out for you whats the benefit of dodging content anyway i can be serious and i am serious why is it not the fault of the lazy
wow,removed,no shit it isnt who disputed that
wow,removed,i only just replaced the helm a week ago and i do everything in this game not really inferior
wow,removed,youre on here all the time and youre never not fucking retarded the issue was never the way bm was tuningwise and it had everything to do with the way it played
wow,removed,are you fucking braindead try outdpsing a demo warlock in single target or a destro in
wow,removed,because his problem was always the mechanics of the spec and not the tuning but it was you who brought up tuning holy shit you really are this fucking braindead
wow,removed,noit can definitely top raids by a noticeable amountand it does
wow,removed,fair enough so we have mobility but you havehad tankiness and selfhealing
wow,removed,which literally cannot be used unless you fire off frostbolts and whats to say youll have saved up icicles a minute before in literally every scenario people assumed my class when they said get gud and talked about how much their spells can do and yeah let me just respec to frost regen some mana and gather frostbolts in the time it takes for someone to blow their flight whistle and hop on yep great idea well thought out
wow,removed,uhno ours has been competitive before legendaries and still doesnt have the wrists
wow,removed,god warlock and were not shit were where we need to be for performance demos just have a higher damage cap for st
wow,removed,idk about that one in all casescant outrange dots that are already applied dark pact and unending resolve are still strong and ok plenty of classes dont feel great because legion design is mostly the worst version of class design agree there but looking at the numberswarlocks are not in a poor spot at all
wow,removed,solesson learned i hope dont reroll and hope to be right where your main is
wow,removed,i konw this subreddit is spammed with these posts but i would love feedback if you play a boomy outlaw or mage am going to post about it anyways
wow,removed,the patch is also not live yet
wow,removed,i cant say i understand why you feel you had to post this here
wow,removed,pros and cons just like anything if there was no con youd never think about not playing whatever the best is on a fight to fight basis even in normal and heroic
wow,removed,effort for reward cause youre not getting upgrades for legendaries handed to you
wow,removed,timegating isnt a problem if you dont feel restricted how do you avoid feeling restricted do the quest ahead of time and if you rerolled hope you rerolled early
wow,removed,it is insanely stupid that i need to play this game and stay with that character otherwise i get the shit end of the stick hold on hereslippery slope you dont need to show me your armory im sure you are in a top guild putting in full time hours to spam keys for ap locking something this important behind a questline that requires what weeks min to complete behind the timelock already is insanely stupid so maybe think twice about rerolling or admit thats the cost if you think ahead youll have more time to catch up and will have wasted less time doing something you wont benefit from i play the game to have fun i have many toons and i play them all because i find the different playstyles fun so you want to eat your cake and have it too nope as a mythic raider or if they put more time into the game on one char as i do so you arent a mythic raider not that all mythic raiders had to play but if youre not even there why do you i really hate the attitude of i put so much time into this why are they at my level already what so if i wanted to get hired as a pilot i shouldnt have to put in the same amount of hours of past experience as many others have in the past just because it would be nice not seeing the logic here and any form of time lock is insane i think i just described why it isnt
wow,removed,youre not in a top guild you dont need to have several alts prepared for nh mythic im saying you would only need to get several characters to that point if you were in a high end guild and most people are not in one people there arent going to be complaining about having to do a dungeon quest several times because its such a minor amount of effort compared to other things theyre doing to prepare
wow,removed,losers like u is why this sub is awful
wow,removed,so its better to be reactive than proactive
wow,removed,how you can not realize that i never said there wasnt a lot to catch up on in legion compared to other xpacs is beyond me seriously obviously theres a lot to catch up on if you reroll sodont reroll or reroll early enough to the point you havent invested much for nothing
wow,removed,
wow,removed,or people could just do the questline on time and not fall behind i just dont see how this is on blizzard
wow,removed,not our job to tell you do some research
wow,removed,nope
wow,removed,its comments like this that confirm that most warlocks are a bit challenged mentally
wow,removed,okay i guess we are dont see why we need to be though i never disagreed that playstyles were garbage so why are we back at square one
wow,removed,yes and the reward has been a legendary item that was also back when legendaries were the reward of a questline this just enhances what you already have no
wow,removed,everything has not my fault youre dumb enough to not realize it stop acting like warlocks have it so bad
wow,removed,yes the previous quests did reward a legendary rather than an upgrade for an already obtained legendary thanks for validating my point so whats yours if it was up to you would you have the questline have the normal yellow or the legendary orange whats a normal yellow and id go with a legendary because this system is garbage as someone whos been unlucky and lucky
wow,removed,first of all stop talking to me like some sort of an elderly english scholar guarantee you dont speak like that in real life stop speaking like that now you hate mages becausereasons again you also have it great damagewise and none of us have it great mechanicwise i dont want to hear it unless you have neither
wow,removed,ah my bad thought you meant gear but we cant really use anythin as comparisons because this is the first time legendaries have worked like this
wow,removed,oh ive read it i just dont see why its a problem shit changes adapt or shut up
wow,removed,how reductive of you
wow,removed,weeks away
wow,removed,you say that like its going to make it out of ptr to that degree but yeah we will becausewhats our choice
wow,removed,required but yeah why not awfully retarded to not be proactive
wow,removed,for answers without doing research
wow,removed,everyones autistic according to reddit not an lfr raider but thanks for the assumption
wow,removed,nope
wow,removed,what are you on about
wow,removed,are you just here to be a toxin on this subreddit ya pretty much im the token vitriol that has to be on a subreddit but i am the opposition i say the opposite of what everyone else is thinking but rly it doesnt matter until notes come out
wow,removed,youve done m to date lul gameplay right insane cost that you dont have to take has to do with everything here time spent in a real life job is equivalent to the required time spent in a game for top players not every player what do you mean what is that logic you brought up playing not me you
wow,removed,nor does op so why is the anus on me to provide info
wow,removed,no one fucking cares
wow,removed,but its not as if theyre ever doing it so they arent and then complaining about having to do something on a short timer
wow,removed,so blizzard are stupidasshole enough to make catch up for alts only and not new players good to know
wow,removed,because i should totally have to upgrade my legendary items
wow,removed,hmmi searched but in the map for me there is no npc for meso i dont do it with google
wow,removed,got to master promo on lol by maining velkoz support ago out of meta is not an issue at all
wow,removed,every casual shit guild has already youre not hardcore just because you cleared an easy first tier
wow,removed,the trinket drop chance is abysmal for most specs though
wow,removed,ohh sorry and ty
wow,removed,how could you misconstrue that quest line as meaningless youd have to be dumb as a door knob to do that
wow,removed,in bags dh here i only mainly
wow,removed,except thats absolute bullshit
wow,removed,thats why you normally die on the way out the speed buff on the way up to odyn compensates for it
wow,removed,is this normal its a gear issue obviously with more health you can lose more health until you drop dangeriously low but thats just one ascept more haste less demon spikes downtime for example
wow,removed,i hope you suffocate in your sleep
wow,removed,legendary sorry friend but youre playing this game far too much at this current moment in time
wow,removed,wow games russians mobas brazilians
wow,removed,yeah bro ur literally autistic haha
wow,removed,wow you jew go burn in an oven
wow,removed,thank you for your submission knoppixx it has been removed from rwow because your post was unrelated to world of warcraft if you submit something that would not be relevant to wow if it had a different title it is not something that is appropriate to submit to rwow this includes real life photos that look like wow if the zone is comparable to something in azeroth you may post it as a self post with a comparison shot this is not an automated removal please read the entire removal reason before contacting us via modmail for if you need clarification read the full httpswwwredditcomrwowwikirules if you feel this post was removed in error please

wow,removed,i fk ur bich
wow,removed,appreciate it but i think i read somewhere that the grummles of pandaria were basically evolved kobolds maybe im wrong
wow,removed,what in the world are you talking about fucking piece of retardness wtf we were all taught the same the game is the same for everyone the change isnt made yet and i wasnt even complaining i dont really care at all about the legendary thing i was telling that the comparison is fucking retarded but i guess more retards think its a good one atleast your comment gave me my needed dose of daily autism thanks retard

wow,removed,you gotta relax retardar see how easy that was no real person gives an actual fuck if someone else doesnt know what a dreadlord is youre just making yourself out to be a complete fuck
wow,removed,first it took him mere minutes to figure out what he was doing its not as if no one was going to get their beta keys seems its going pretty smoothly and everyone is getting their keys huh definitely warranted your immature reactions for sure seems to me everyone else should follow your lead i dont understand its almost like they dont want to seem like idiots weird second there was absolutely no reason for you to act that way the only reason you did so was because blizzard didnt directly give you a beta key and your entitled ass felt the need to find some reason to vent your frustrations youll never get anything you want acting like a spoiled child better learn now or youll be forced to learn the hard way
wow,removed,all of you fucks that are mad over blizzard doing an event you dont need to participate in i am going to pray to god you all get cancer
wow,removed,year old worgen right here you like dags mickey the pikey

wow,removed,no it didnt they had to run custom code because of the hardware they no doubt were using not being suited for that amount of connections no they had to run custom code because they literally had far more concurrent players online than any official server ever had its clear you have never even played on nost the population was actually a huge problem and i even played on a high pop server back in the day of retail vanilla i actually started playing on a different server because of the nost pop issues millions of people enjoy the retail game i doubt thats the case any more especially after wod i see no facts only a lot of made up assumptions without much evidence to back them up it took too long to level the mechanics did not work smoothly the gearitem level curve was extremely unbalanced the honor system was stupid and easily abused earning gold was a mindless chore the runbacks were absurdly painful for many instances etc and yet with all those flaws its still far more fun than levelling being so mindlessly easy and broken having more epics than rare items in the game getting welfare legendaries an absolutely retarded gearitem level curve a pvp system so bad that you can have half an hour fights and both opponents still be on hp instance runs being lootsprints requiring no teamwork or communication and the list goes on vanilla wasnt perfect but it sure as hell is a lot better than wow is now why wouldnt you just go on wowhead any question you have about something is going to be in the comments for an item or a quest or a mob hahahahahah way to prove my point even when i ask a question that could be answered in google i get many helpful responses and they are more than willing to answer followup questions it just goes to show the difference in mindset and youve provided and amazing example of why i still choose vanilla servers if you dont believe me i could take a screenshot for you i asked is barrens contested or horde zone instantly replies and a whisper answering try asking that in retail and screenshot the nonreplies or people calling you a retard for not using google or wowhead

wow,removed,ive heard a good number of people over the years suggest that the dwarf guards actually say wash yer back an example can be found here i was just hoping the person who i replied to didnt think this was the case if im going over the top then id have to point out that a scottish person still says watch you can clearly hear the t it never sounds like wash
wow,removed,how is it a fucking stupid question you fucking moron im asking what the best flasks are so i dont buy the wrong shit u cunt
wow,removed,cherry picking anecdotal evidence shit thats good enough for me youre right blizzard doesnt tend to name things x of the y any more than everyone else does

wow,removed,most people orientate looking north you cuck
wow,removed,guy was hardly a scapegoat he had executive editorial power when it came to decision making on balance itemization encounters and so on then again this is reddit and more importantly the hivemind circlejerk that is the wow subreddit omg you didnt like ghostcrawler you must not know what youre talking about dude was shit at his job and continually kept class balance out of whack to favor the ones he enjoyed not only that but he led personal vendettas against players and was entirely unprofessional go fuck yourself
wow,removed,miles km post feedback in rtometric
wow,removed,can i pay you to lvl shit for me please please
wow,removed,wrong most of your work took a life of practice
wow,removed,its a hidden message just like when girls say no they mean yes p
wow,removed,these kind of people are pathetic the kind of people that never challenge themselves
wow,removed,there is no good for him here this is pathetic
wow,removed,yeah youre a fucking degenerate kill yourself
wow,removed,nike these kind of people are grade a losers
wow,removed,its specifically to stop you from doing what you want to do i know i wish i could too
wow,removed,we can probably figure out his name rather easy here is what we can immediately tell hes from one of the bloodhoofs he has an ilvl of as of right now or close to it likely his name starts with a v ends with an r and the letters appear to be t i and m respectively so it leaves us with this so far vtimr the letter between m and r appear to be o but i cant entirely tell
wow,removed,she is on a different server so im not sure its his wife probably an online girlfriend he met by being alpha as fuck during dungeon runs
wow,removed,little me is a healing class a priest to be exact in wow each class has specialisations specs discipline disc is a healing spec which is based around buffing your team with atonement a spelleffect that converts your damage to enemy targets into healing for those affected by atonement unfortunately a lot of people probably dont quite understand how it works or execute the healing poorly because they dont grasp that dps healing disc also has some disadvantages in particular healing situations like those that require a lot of reactive healing since atonement can fall off of your teammates and you need to reapply it you can only heal as fast as you can dps with a few cooldowns to help you out this tank had a chip on his shoulder obviously
wow,removed,shouldnt have edited out the names
wow,removed,this is why i hate pansy ass reddit rules we should be able to post names of losers like this so that others can avoid them
wow,removed,what if there was a screenshot posted like above with other screenslogs to prove validity to help discourage photoshop nonsense and the names censored then people could vote on whether the person deserved to be exposed or not after reaching a certain number of votes the op would have the okay to post the name without mod intervention and when that time comes the following meme must always accompany the name drop this is sparta
wow,removed,name and shame please
wow,removed,cool you guys found him but this is a textbook witch hunt and is against the rules
wow,removed,is there a reddit policy to obscure names im not sure why people do this if the guy is a jerk why doesnt the world get to know irl you dont get to get yourself censored when you are posted to someones social media account wo you knowing
wow,removed,read the rwow rules witch hunts are against the rules
wow,removed,shit raiders say

wow,removed,i heard deathwing got taken out by some pandaren monk who came back in time to clip his nails
wow,removed,dont listen to the old gods words he means to deceive you champions
wow,removed,the other thing no one pays attention to is sub fees maplestory was arguably huge in mmo terms and was fantastic if you like grinding and got satisfaction from a grind but then they went from paytolookpretty to paytowin and the game started to taper off maplestory had some hilariously bad sections of grinding mobs in between relevant and helpful quests being a korean mmo the quests were wonky and oftentimes unclear as to what the hell you were actually doing so players skipped them we waited for weeks and months for a experience event or drop event level cap was at the time and the game was tough i finally reached level to get my third job class as an icelightning mage after six months of grinding up from level at my second job class six months and it was fun guilds were social drops were rare and you werent ever just rolling in money unless you were a cleric but once the microtransactions came along that gave new weapons by rng or new skills you had to have on some of the newer classes or even experience tickets you could use whenever and stacked with world stuff the game took a hit then the big bang happened and suddenly it was possible to go from in a day or two gone was the sense of achievement you felt by being over level gone were the lowbies giving you fame just because of your level and fawning over you like you were some sort of god this all sounds super familiar yeah no mmo rules forever but ill be damn ed if wow hasnt been doing it longer than the rest
wow,removed,hey uchrisolivertimes dont use your bot to plug your electronic demon conspiracy guide
wow,removed,im not nordic but he does sound dumb as hell you dont need to make him speak like a retard to fit the nordic theme
wow,removed,thats such retarded logic he was unkillable because of bad design and them not understanding how to make his health pools to make him killable if they made a boss with a minute enrage with a trillion hp is that suddenly a hard boss youd love no its bad design
wow,removed,what in the actual fuck are you trying to say no one had to use tanks because they removed a badly designed fight lol you people need to learn the difference between things that are hard for good reason and stupid design if they released an encounter like today with the same shitty game mechanics that existed then there would be riots in the streets as you people fail to kill it on normal bad design does not a good hard boss make it would be doable now because theres not taunt resists and other shitty game mechanics that existed in vanilla thats the whole point vanilla was a badly designed mess that people who didnt play hold on a fuckin pedestal
wow,removed,wait are you actually stupid
wow,removed,fuck you
wow,removed,then youre super casual and dont fall into the category nonshit raid team i can make a demon hunter today and have gold on monday youre just making excuses to be lazy or not dedicated enough

wow,removed,world top clear content wipes after multiple nerfs this isnt even going from hardcore to casual this is shitter staying shit and bullshitting haaaaard lel
wow,removed,its supposed to be high you fucking bunch of clueless pathetic retards
wow,removed,i know what ive done and you know what youve done which is exactly why i know you are full of shit
wow,removed,because his team is shit
wow,removed,you missed da big one being bad
wow,removed,im a simple man i see ass i upvote
wow,removed,true but by and large they dont really care about occasional goldbuyers over the years before tokens were introduced i bought prob half a million and just spent it normally worked out fine
wow,removed,and a chump ability no explosion doesnt work on some enemiesplayers with some weird conditions cooldown
wow,removed,retard
wow,removed,anything vishas says adds to the excitement
wow,removed,there is much i missed out due to character limit if i dont get downvoted to the ground ill continue

wow,removed,hilarious ive been here since the vanilla beta sure you have i was playing when it was pre alpha and here you are throwing a tantrum you replied to me whos the childish one now again you replied to me also why should i waste time researching so you dont look like a complete fucking moron get out of here child you arent mentally old enough for the internet much less wow again you replied to me so these are your options you can either fuck off or stop projecting no doubt you will reply to this because you need the last word its so very important to yourself esteem you will reply again much like you did at the start almost as if your only goal in life is failing at bringing other people down
wow,removed,really you thought i was insulting you when i clearly meant that rogues needed more nerfs how about you stop being a sensitive little bitch
wow,removed,a bunch of rtards karma whoring with the new crappy meme like hottubs
wow,removed,jesus fucking christ you cancerous community they did something neat that affected you in no negative way whatsoever and you bitched about it endlessly and now youre cheering that they conceded and reverted the change
wow,removed,you should thank him for saving you the trouble of having to carry such an egotistical loudmouthed retard
wow,removed,for a few seconds fucksake
wow,removed,thank you for demonstrating how retarded you are
wow,removed,because it fixes the issues such as your taxi mount getting killed and your mount not even carrying you to the flight master
wow,removed,except i was talking about other issues with the whistle its only a few seconds of fucking cutscene that fixes the issues for fucks sake are you seriously that thick to not see the connection are you seriously not able to think i mean i know avarage person especially on reddit is saddeningly retarded compared to the potential of human intelligence but this is even beyond the standart retardation you are something else my insignificant fellow earthling
wow,removed,right the part of the people on this sub that are mentally challenged believe fixing exploits is removing fun i forgot thanks for the reminder
wow,removed,why op thinks its cool to piss on him for that and post it on reddit nontheless is beyond me because some people feel the need to be morally superior and stroke themselves off while mocking others in the manner that is considered acceptable by their social circle its the same human instinct that causes things like muslims stoning gays or the lynch mobs of the late or gossip bullying among teenage girls or hell being smug over what kind of car you drive hahaha look at those other idiots being idiots im so much better than them hahahaha theyre idiots right people yeah theyre idiots ahahaha im so much better than them and so much more righteous and moral and ahahahahaha theyre toxic idiots ahahahaha
wow,removed,hour and not killed boss you so bad
wow,removed,both players are being a bit of a cunt imo
wow,removed,why are you still pming me can you go and harass someone else
wow,removed,its super relevant that you personally can manage to play hours in nights with the same people to clear a dungeon thanks for sharing your inspiring story
wow,removed,can you please stop ive asked you several times already
wow,removed,seriously stop messaging me this is annoying no idea why youre writing walls of text in response to me asking you to stop ive been pretty clear on that i am not reading what youre typing its just annoying to have a constant pm every few minutes they really need to add a block function to reddit
wow,removed,oh yeah like pve doesnt have dipshits like this i dont deal with retards in pvp because im a high rated high experienced player
wow,removed,its fucking pve how do you become to best person to play a spec when all you do is tank mobs and know strats

wow,removed,wish i could join in my sub ran out last week rip me

wow,removed,fuck me and my noy affordable gametime even tho i preordered legion months ago

wow,removed,retards gonna retard
wow,removed,die in real life op i wish with all my heart that the next time you cross a street a truck will need a new paint job you worthless sack of shit waste of human life
wow,removed,im not surprised rwow gets triggered by retard

wow,removed,ah yes the nice guy explanation for everything about women she must be a bitch
wow,removed,working it i concur people are dumb and dont care what something is intended to be used for
wow,removed,fuckin stupid
wow,removed,yeah im sure no sarcasm was intended whatsoever kinda like how when your mom says thank you ncilm for not being a complete retard and putting your dirty socks in the dirty clothes hamper i mean she complimented you
wow,removed,why isnt hillary in prison
wow,removed,all i did was ask him how his butthole was doing
wow,removed,lol i love how you got banned from the cynicalbrit subreddit for shitposting trash like this and now youre still complaining about this person on unrelated subreddits get a life
wow,removed,it is simultaneously so pathetic and so hilarious just how mad you are that you feel the need to post times in this thread alone seriously dude get some help and get a life

wow,removed,lol so mad calm down kid
wow,removed,just cuck my shit up famalam
wow,removed,hey psycho why did you cross out the name on the forum when its a public forum what the hell is wrong with you why didnt you cross out your reddit name drukenorc before you made this post asshole
wow,removed,why did he assume the babies gender before it could identify itself
wow,removed,thats cuz grills dont exist
wow,removed,youve clearly never needed to share a bathroom with a sister
wow,removed,that is so problematic i am so triggered right now we need to erase men from existence
wow,removed,httpadultimgsitebvhgifv
wow,removed,his name is wojtek and he was kicked out from goon squad for this shit he really needs to rethink his priorities
wow,removed,so you either a leveled a new monk by hand to make a point or b gave blizzard money for a name change to make a point thats pretty fucking stupid honestly
wow,removed,you did something either tediously inane or backwardsthinking retarded just to once have the name nerfmeharder if either of those outcomes are true you should probably feel embarassed and i didnt call op stupid im only calling you stupid
wow,removed,people are fucking gross plus honestly after growing up with my sister and now being married glad im a dude compared to the gross biological shit they get stuck with
wow,removed,apparently automod is triggered
wow,removed,man up you big baby bitch
wow,removed,the timewalking weapons are now there for transmog mostly
wow,removed,those orcs look awfully sickly
wow,removed,thats because you are brother siblings with sister ofcourse boys are harder to raise
wow,removed,every time someone tells me wow is just a random game i will link this masterpiece
wow,removed,then they all walked in to orgrimar and simultaneously said cheapest gold at wwwgamehappy
wow,removed,retard
wow,removed,all the people in this thread saying its your fault somehow or why are you still leader of the guild etc fuck you no seriously go fuckin join harambe or some shit no person should ever have to resort to such things as stepping down as gm isolating their wow usage from everything else like a darknet assassin or anything like that even if it the op did something to compromise their account the efforts they have gone through to secure their account is way beyond what anyone should ever have to do and should fix the problem instead it has become apparent the cs does not take all the necessary precautions to protect an account ive seen this with my own account after losing access to my own auth and have seen it with other games as well its a bit ridiculous how little information is actually required to reset an account or remove an auth a little social engineering goes a long way
wow,removed,get bagnon you fucking scud
wow,removed,and mods are now confirmed for leftist hillshills great only people who have problem with the word are people from the left whose exactly targeted by the word modscucks
wow,removed,then fucking reroll if you want to be the class dealing with trash jesus fuck this community is full of retards

wow,removed,shut up you stupid asshole cuck what a worthless thing to say
wow,removed,read the sub rules no boosting posts
wow,removed,thanks for the laughd
wow,removed,then what the fuck did you make this post for
wow,removed,i am a bot on behalf of reddit i would like to thank you for your honesty we live in harried times honesty is in short supply thats why when you go out of your way to assure the reddit community that your comment is honest i honestlybot have made it my mission to thank you
wow,removed,the speculation is that theres a hidden cap at the question if anyone has more already
wow,removed,ask any person with mythic dungeons almost all of them have but not a single person has
wow,removed,do you know what the word speculation means guess not
wow,removed,which streamer
wow,removed,that pic should be more than enough to convince anyone still in deny that the sjw cancer of the american university is now metastasized playing with inperialism religion in a video game anniversary of the african american studies speakers series and a nice seal of approval because only approved by the sjw party are approved
wow,removed,ill keep making them till i have my answerits what i care about as running mythic if the cap is is just pointless and a waste of time
wow,removed,so the premise of your speach is based on yet another standard cancerous sjw falacies like how a game is orientalist i can too make word like bitchisist you and people like you are really bitchisist when it come to the way youve decided to approach anything your bitchisime in its approach to various communities and how that might possibly undermine more positive outcomes from the game
wow,removed,f to pay respect
wow,removed,yes because having bad legendarys is sooooo good kappa
wow,removed,no we still havent cleared it yet
wow,removed,buzzfeed is an sjw safe space but then trolls who hate sjws perpetuate the narrative by posting fake shit and its hilarious if you get it it only reaffirms a false sense of understanding if you dont
wow,removed,sco doesnt have neither has towelie dude
wow,removed,screenshot
wow,removed,its super relevant that you personally can manage to play hours in nights with the same people to clear a dungeon thanks for sharing your inspiring story

wow,removed,dont worry chief when i want to know about smearing shit on my face and bumbling around life then ill immediately think of you and come ask for tips
wow,removed,with how you go around trash talking devs and singling them out because you didnt like an expansion while the rest of us who also didnt like the expansion refuse to stoop to such a shit level you literally dont know what youre talking about just like you literally cant play wow at any competent level tell you what when you either clear heroic hfc at current content or hit in wow then you can talk to me about anything gaming related seeing as how you will never hit nor clear heroic hfc without buying a run from someone i can confirm you literally have no idea what youre talking about go back to collecting pets or books or what the fuck ever you do theres literally a reason why people hate that garbage bag holinka and you dont know why youre already the master i should come to you for advice teach you can literally play animal crossing and save yourself the subscription fee from blizzard i cant imagine why you log into play wow any day other than to pet battle
wow,removed,aww thats adorable you equate being a decent individual who thinks you should treat the devs with respect instead of attacking them at literally every opportunity has any correlation with how good i am or am not at wow no i make fun of holinka because i know hes retarded and doesnt respond to facts numbers and feedback anyone that played on the wod beta knows this i abstained from raiding during this expansion because i hated it oh no youve abstained from raiding pretty much period rofl did you just use as a benchmark oh my we got a badass here i used it as a benchmark for you since youre garbage this is the shitty standard im holding for you just like an earned heroic hfc clear i raid or more accurately in this expansion i pvp my pet count is incredibly low and i only have mounts because i dont collect those either books are you implying reading is bad or something give me a break bud you dont do anything of value well and the problem is that youre too childish to see that hating someone because they didnt deliver changes catered to you specifically or because they talked to someone else in a way you dont deem acceptable you should learn about things like paying for a product fortunately i find value in other things than pvp at this time in wow but holinkas ability to design pvp is terrible his leadership execution etc its all terrible the problem is that youre a sunshine pumping idiot stop voicing your fucking misinformed opinion about things and now you would also attack casual players by saying that they cant be skilled or anything and they should just unsubscribe except youre not skilled never have been nor will ever be naw man youre right i log in only to pet battle youre so good at reading me look at how many level i have and how many achievements i have look at this initial pet battle quest that is account wide that i never completed i have looked at your achievements youre a piece of casual garbage that thinks because they can join a battleground or a raid they know shit about anything you dont youre a worthless whiteknight that argues shit because youre misinformed but think its the right thing to do sorry youre fucking worthless
wow,removed,your whole post is belligerent and not really worthy of much of a reply but i like how you think you stalked through my posts and found me thatd be pretty low even if it were true cutie its okay you keep giving this community a bad name ill continue trying to fight the good fight against people like you oh retard its really easy to find you when you post stupid shit maybe dont post your characters names on reddit and then talk a lot of stupid smack that you in no way can back up ill keep up the good fight to stop moronic blizzard white knights from inhibiting change i know tards like you think youre the only people that pay money to play wow
wow,removed,exactly and both should be gunned down so they dont ruin experience of perfect aka us players fuck yeah
wow,removed,well if mods start enforcing this rule all us population of this sub will get banned because you know all americans are racist stereotypes exist for a reason dont they s

wow,removed,i mean you can put your penis on the other soo on the other hand legendaries cant cook
wow,removed,not really related but if nost is gonna come back whats stopping blizzard from competely fucking them
wow,removed,i used to play on private servers due to not wanting to pay for a subscription pros of a private server you dont have to pay for a subscription you can play on any expansion you like cons of a private server pretty much everything else not always managed well not always gms available not running the newest expansion not always up to date less players all in all i would rather pay a month for a sub
wow,removed,its a fucking website god all the retards in this community makes me so fucking tilted
wow,removed,what a shit post dude im a private server player myself but i still love wow in all its forms thats why i still come to this subreddit i dont understand why any wow lover would want to screw themselves over and not be able to play old expansions even if you dont like old content why would you want to deny thousands if not millions of other people a fun experience private server and retail players arnt an us vs them its all just people who love the franchise
wow,removed,whoops i did mean pawn prat is a chat modifier
wow,removed,years ago seriously this is just karma whoring of the worst kind
wow,removed,or just use tmorph yknow wink wink
wow,removed,just cause no one is going to miss you when you die doesnt mean we cant appreciate other people after death unsub from the subreddit if this is so painfull to see
wow,removed,im really sick of blizzards arbitrary rules and limitations its about time to start removing limitations for several things in this game sick of seeing cant use this here cant do that no sorry sorry bro youre in the wrong zone wrong act wrong water not enough light not enough mana to use this toy put it down look up more first must be mounted must be sitting must be crawling games are supposed to be fun yeah fun
wow,removed,most women are unable to be leaders so there is that and ofc most men too but women in particular i would say move on to a more elitist guild is your only option and take the ones you think can share your elitist way with you
wow,removed,the main reason nost grew so quick was because of the content drought in wod as long as legion continues to be good i doubt many people would choose nost over the live game
wow,removed,put your stupid cell phone away and never aim it at your monitor again obs fraps shadowplay etc will record your screen aup your video looks worse than a sega cd game from stop doing it
wow,removed,i mean what i say im not acting or pretending im sick of video quality on the internet being stagnant do you want me to get into it or do you want to apologize for using that dismissive nebulous label
wow,removed,hi print screen this is getting out of control more and more idiots with their cell phones
wow,removed,best legendary for holy priests is the belt that increases the power of holy words leading to extremely potent burst healing after periods of low damage
wow,removed,are you retarded
wow,removed,thats an interesting result ill have to look into it
wow,removed,why does night trap for the sega cd from the look better than a lot of video and screenshots in you dont ever take your cell phone and point it at your monitor its insulting to both you and your lcd
wow,removed,what did you do before cell phones take out a polaroid camera to your monitor nope what kind of psycho wants worse quality over time are you going back to a crt television that weighs pounds next
wow,removed,httpswwwthebuddyforumcomhonorbuddyforumbansectionbanreports
wow,removed,lol will they ever learn bastards
wow,removed,could you hint as to where you see these bans i dont see it on the common places buddyforum soapbox rotations firehack
wow,removed,thanks but i prefer big boobs marinated in honey
wow,removed,post discord info cant wait to see you do a complete with your disdain for quality
wow,removed,my bots still running strong
wow,removed,feel free to rub it in my face if that comes to pass its winwin i suppose anyways either it actually comes in january and the mindnumbing agony of farming the same soon bosses fades or im right the optimistic pessimist always comes out on top
wow,removed,youre a minority it takes like minutes to buy gold is that minutes saved really worth a markup
wow,removed,i have only been kicked out of a guild once and it was during wotlk i was years old at the time and in this guild i got promoted to an officer i was really excited lol the next day someone called me a faggot and a girly boy so i demoted him and the gm kicked me i remember being really upset at the time and possible crying now i raid lead a group of awesome people cough still looking for healers cough
wow,removed,theres no risk buying gold from blizz thats why
wow,removed,ouch ive never actually heard of somebody getting banned for buying gold did you do it really obviously or something
wow,removed,not the same argument at all these are very different topics and theres still absolutely no relation to this scenario maybe instead of just tossing out links you dont understand you could actually articulate an argument
wow,removed,ive bought and sold gold numerous times and im involved with communities that do a lot of rmting and i can assure you that it definitely is a rare occurrence
wow,removed,i do understand what youre saying and it does seem kind of intuitive and youve repeated yourself times now so its not like you havent made yourself clear you just happen to be too full of hubris to understand what im saying how about you link another article about investment in the middle east to prove your point
wow,removed,ah youre right so blizz can legally fuck us all in the ass and not give a shit lol
wow,removed,only thinks hes relevant try being like me and you might have a chance at joining a real group now heal me noob while i carry you
wow,removed,i would call them
wow,removed,i deserve compensation ehh nah sorry kiddo you should read the terms of service
wow,removed,quick make a subreddit to seek out long lost subreddits
wow,removed,thanks seems like everyone on this subreddit is willfully blind to rmt
wow,removed,wow tokens hardly affected the rmting market thats a cold hard fact that anyone whos actually involved in rmting can tell you if rmting has gone down its because the popularity of the game itself has gone down or because its much easier to acquire gold in wod and legion than it was before i dont really care about your feelings or what you think is patently false
wow,removed,
wow,removed,ahhhhhhhh i want to fuck her
wow,removed,gold buyers dont get banned objectively false statement is objectively false
wow,removed,thats cute lol
wow,removed,why would somebody who has low risk tolerance buy gold in the first place because they want gold thats the answer to the question you asked edit holy shit the reading comprehension in this sub is abysmal no you just fucking suck at communication you asked a question and it was answered you meant to ask a different question and are all pissy people didnt respond to what you meant to but didnt actually ask theyd buy gold because the reward outweighs the risk its a fuckin spectrum man some wouldnt have ever bought gold some may buy it less often because of the risk or just dislike the risk those people can have a low risk tolerance not no risk tolerance and want to lower their risk when the chance comes thus theyd shift over you are the one that failed to actually say what you meant read what you said look at what those words mean
wow,removed,tfw your bot is working fine and your account is unbanned lmfao using a public bot program in the year
wow,removed,i will vote falsely like times over the course of this evening enjoy your results
wow,removed,its also pretty much risk free unless you buy some absurd quantities
wow,removed,im pretty sure they are both mathematically correct as greater than if it was numbers fine whatever with words it doesnt make any fucking sense to list it like that riamverysmart
wow,removed,youre either pathetically retarded or just a pathetic troll
wow,removed,
wow,removed,i never said dk and dh shit for brains
wow,removed,how many raid leaders did she blow to get a spot as a hunter
wow,removed,why cant hunters act civil like some of the other underperforming classes did when they were shit i never saw elemental shamans qq this much i never saw boomies qq this much about how the were shit in m i have never seem ferals qq this much even though theyve consistently been shit since legion launch i never seen rets complain this much probably forgot a few other classesspecs
wow,removed,obvious inappropriate conduct fuck off who the fuck are you you condescending armchair speculator passing judgement on shit when you probably still live with your parents and have never held a real job before in your life and if you dont still live with your parents and still take this weird pseudomorality crime position to a fucking twitter like then you really really need to get a life
wow,removed,how will the jobless year olds get their dose of vanilla crack now find out on the next episode of retail vs legacy
wow,removed,lol rekt
wow,removed,vengeance of azeroth is good scripted well only issue is low pop
wow,removed,the thing that really makes this perfect is your ugly af dressed character reminds me of the many fucking hilarious this guy looks like a person who is crossdressing with no sense of fashion and looks like a mix of a hobo and a colorful cockatoo transmogs i made because nothing is funnier than the alliancehorde rallying behind a hero who looks like a demented weirdo
wow,removed,finally this is hilarious
wow,removed,i dont understand this shit about pirate stigma or why the retail wow community cares negatively about vanilla wow servers in the first place if vanilla wow was offered by blizzard then the majority would play it there it isnt and therefore they dont it isnt about not paying the per month or whatever in fact those types of people who come sniffing around are actively mocked and usually are asking for latest xpac servers at this point its just two communities playing two different games you enjoy yours theyll enjoy theirs when blizzard decide to offer an alternative to private servers the community will switch over to it and the majority of private servers will die out ive been playing onoff retail and private servers for over years and constantly losing all progress to unprofessional server owners or blizzards cd letters is something we are all happy to pay blizzard to avoid they just dont want our money as a final word i do understand that servers acting to monetize wow and profit from it is a large reason for blizzard to actively attack and shut them down it is their property after all but when they go after servers such as nostalrius elysium who do not monetize themselves there is no reason behind it because the people there only want something that blizzard no longer provides
wow,removed,boi get the popcorn
wow,removed,compared to vanilla retail pve is a casual casino yup thats why only guilds have killed mythic helya god damn do vanillaers have their heads so far up their ass about how hard vanilla pve is
wow,removed,no they arent rofl
wow,removed,i hope legacy servers die off entirely
wow,removed,theyre just milking legacy server talk and trying to stay relevant about it said the same a few months ago and got heavily downvoted for it look where we are now
wow,removed,is a lot more than or however many those private servers last that get shut down in a few months anyway
wow,removed,its not piracy at all i purchased vanilla world of warcraft with my money legal currency i have every right to play the fucking game its not my fault blizzard morphed a better version of the game into a cesspool
wow,removed,youre exactly the kind of person that the nost team doesnt like youre the cancer of the vanilla community vanilla is time consuming not hard mechanically the game is extremely easy and the most difficult thing about vanilla is googling a guide raidleading a raid
wow,removed,finally a real breathing person that gets it faith restored
wow,removed,tits or gtfo
wow,removed,reeeeeeeee someone who currently pays a sub for legion is also playing on a private server even though he currently pays a sub fee reeeeeeeeeeeeee
wow,removed,no why would they it doesnt make him any less of a scumbag though
wow,removed,yeah excuse me for attempting to play the game i bought i didnt buy any of the last expansions because i dont want to play any of the last expansions what i want to play is something that i paid for and have no way of strictly legally obtaining yeah man sounds just like a thief
wow,removed,i dont think youre getting it finding a group of reliable people is a very real obstacle to overcome it isnt a given
wow,removed,patpat
wow,removed,no one knowscares because no one plays unholy
wow,removed,honestly from what ive seen from the people who defend legacy servers online im totally glad im not playing with them most of them seem like complete dicks
wow,removed,and only because its the minority that means its irrelevant if it doesnt bother you simply shut uptheres more than a few people with said problem
wow,removed,oh so you mean a person can be annoyed by dipshits that rather troll around because leg is used for legendary you´re prolly the biggest clown i´ve ever seen
wow,removed,the title makes it very clear that leglegendary but i guess you cant see the connection with an iq below shut up if you cant provide any help
wow,removed,not the members of note from back in the day just the hand me down name
wow,removed,people stream to twitch all the time our ingame names are pseudonyms why are weirdos crossing them out by the way its easier to harass someone on reddit than in wow in wow you can get suspended and lose your character on reddit you can just instantly make a new account in reality your reddit names should be blocked out if anything not wow names
wow,removed,where those assholes at nurfed at retards
wow,removed,youre retarded
wow,removed,roses are red that flower is tan and i still have no legendary feelsbadman
wow,removed,we get it you are shit ezrabar you dont have to make post to let everyone know that you want all things instantly accessible to you
wow,removed,calling a cuck a cuck asshole are you a cucks
wow,removed,oh yes they want good loot as easy as possible and your statement about taking a game serious to a certain extent is utter bullshit ppl like you are crippeling for any mmo and i hope randoms dont have to bother with your shitty attitude fuck you
wow,removed,probably sweating because of how fat you are
wow,removed,made this account just to comment your ui gave me stage fucking cancer if aids had a ui for wow that would be it if i had a choice between the vanilla ui or that i would not play the game
wow,removed,hey if i suck your cock in public can we just forget about all this i feel awful
wow,removed,talking about dicks i cant help but imagine odyn furiously masturbating when he catches someone having a fight of some sort which creeps the fuck out of me cuz you know we fought godking skovald in frotn of him nooooooooooo
wow,removed,i was stroking my cock and almost came but then i read also how can you claim to have any working knowledge of the game while acting like a fucking warrior puts out comparable dps to mage can you tell me what you mean by that nythendra illgynoth ursoc cenarius i mean thats not all the bosses but um a lot of them anyway gonna finish stroking now wish me luck
wow,removed,crippling for real life i am sure i have a better job than you white knight
wow,removed,dont get triggered cuck
wow,removed,feel stupid but could you break it down step by step trying and failing atm mate
wow,removed,this is fucking gay
wow,removed,as a fellow icc farmer i can wholeheartedly say shut up if you dont like clearing trash dont farm old raid content im sure theres some pet battles or something you can do
wow,removed,you could say doesnt matter with transmog does it to your small complaint
wow,removed,oh im sorry i got lost in the bullshit trash mob discussion you were trying to bring up get over yourself
wow,removed,im sorry i thought this was a mmorpg not an excel spread sheet theres more than just being top dps right now were the only class with a colas hall thats just a reskinned dungeon who arent in charge have no members of the class theyre all vrykul and one iron dwarf around instead of important lore characters like every other class and the only class who have an absolute shitlord of a leader thats so bad everyone hates him enough to make him a raid boss also he acts like we dont exist when we do visit him in the dungeon were there to prove our valor desire having done that because fuck consistent narratives
wow,removed,the world quest gear is the most useless part to me i only have one follower who ever goes with me anywhere she has world quest gear in both slots all further world quest gear is pointless
wow,removed,not for me
wow,removed,did you piss someone off recently someone is going through and spam reporting every single one of your comments for some dumb reason

wow,removed,what joy is there when i shove my own poop back inside my butt
wow,removed,im an adult which is why i really weigh my options when making a decision i decided to play on pvp server because i like to gank alliance dweebs that later cry about it on reddit even though there are numerous pve servers
wow,removed,ya because thats was the argument right im quiting over a sword no read and comprehend fucking retard go play your warrior
wow,removed,clean your life up
wow,removed,hardest boss was my dick
wow,removed,the movie is funny very cartoonish but to take this seriously you need leukimia or smth
wow,removed,i think he asks why you are using swords as a transmog which is a legitimate question what kind of tasteless person do you have to be to transmog your warglaives into a sword
wow,removed,i asked if you had the same feelingnot about how one could play if one feels like it ppl can play for a lot of reasons but its your way or your a retard yes
wow,removed,no youre being retarded
wow,removed,guess whats the product if its free

wow,removed,teaser looks promising
wow,removed,if hes gonna tell me im spreading misinformation after hes spent the last couple hours commenting nothing but wrong information and trying to belittle people in the process all over the thread then you bet ill insult him the fact he cant own up to being wrong and deleted his comment before reporting me instead speaks volumes about him
wow,removed,im not gonna go crying to the mods every time someones a moron when i can just tell them this is ridiculous

wow,removed,twitchtvbylekoyd check out my boy he is similar to the streamer mitch jones and he also drives a entertaining guy drop a follow xd
wow,removed,twitchtvbylekoyd check out my boy he is similar to the streamer mitch jones and he also drives a entertaining guy drop a follow xd
wow,removed,why should i have min of my time wasted because everyone else is a fuckign douch bag so my time should be wasted you should just kick someone for no reason for free that is stupid there should be some type of a penalty or else people can kick anyone for whatever reason just for fun you could get the last boss to life then kick someone just for a fucking laugh
wow,removed,the problem is you can kick someoen for free and have no reason for it i whisper some of the people after said i suck but gave no reason the mage and warlock kept pulling random trash from behind the entire run and they got mad that i pulled the phase of the wolf boss in halls of valor without the healer when im a dk and dont need a healer for that part i did my job as a tank i tanked stuff there really is no need to kick someone unless someone is doing really bad like afk randomly for minutes without warning or wiped the group on purpose time and time again simply not being an esports raider is not good enough to waste such a large part of someones time you need a mechanic to stop it from being abused and if that means you dont get your end of dungeon rewards not really that big of a deal for a trade off of getting someone else does not seem nearly as bad as getting absolutely nothing at all for not doing anything wrong
wow,removed,how would you react when a retard mage and warlock keep pulling trash
wow,removed,why should someone get removed from a group because special snowflakes dont like their personality so long as they are performing their role who gives a fuck
wow,removed,i like how you assume that the person kicked is always a troll asshole and the people who vote kick are always perfect little angels who have never done anything wrong the nazis vote kicked the jews did the jews deserve it
wow,removed,at least people in your group agree that you deserved to be kicked either theyre just dickspossible or theres something youre doing wrongeven more likely
wow,removed,maybe not all the time i think or times but wasting so much of your time for a stupid reason is pretty fucking stupid one time i was kicked because i decided to go an alternate route than what people normally take so i was kicked because i was not simply following the meta of clearing that dungeon then i got put on a wait timer for abandoning a dungeon simply because some other person decided that i deserved it aparently dps never does anything wrong also its always the tank or the healers fault it might be reasonable kicks sometimes but the fact that you can kick people for free means that it is easily exploitable by assholes or trolls if anyone here has played black desert you can know what i mean with the karma system you might not beable to kill someone who is in a grind spot you are in but if you just make them kill you over and over till they go red they will basically be forced to leave both systems are stupid and i dont think losing at end of a dungeon is really that big of a deal if they are such a big problem you need them gone and you are willing to sacrifice a part of your loot then it will be well deserved but now that it is free and has no repercussions for doing so you can waste someones time for the very most smallest possible thing that could irritate you someone could even be overly friendly and you are just a mean jerk and not like seeing people happy well lets kick that guy why just because thats why
wow,removed,nazis killing jews was a majority decision basically every genocide in the history of the world was a majority decision was that right the problem is you can do it for free what if a happy go lucky guy who was friendly joined a group of angry basement virgins and they basically vote kicked because they didnt like happy people its pretty stupid and to be honest if you are not willing to sacrifice a very small amount of your end of dungeon loot it seriously is clearly not causing that much of an issue if it was really they wanted you to leave badly as you put it being willing to sacrifice end dungeon loot would hardly be a concern as it is right now all it takes is a single mouse click you dont need to want someone gone badly at all to perform that action you can even queue with friends and randomly kick people just for fun
wow,removed,rude who cares if you dont like someone there is an ignore button for a reason there is billion people on the earth you cant make everyone happy i am not going to change my personality to make some random special snowflake on the internet happy if i am kicked i want it for a very good reason like being drastically undergeared for the specific difficulty or randomly afkd without telling the group first not because someone does not agree with something i said if they dont agree with something i said then dont read what i type then also one of the reasons they said was because i pulled phase fenryr when the healer was still running back but we finished her without a single issue no one died then we ran to the boss phase location and some other person pulled about adds to the group thats when they kicked me one dude was yelling at me for pulling without the healer even though we finished it without a single incident no one in the group even got down to hp is it really that bad to ask that someone pay a price to waste someone elses time if what you say is true if someone really wanted x person out of the group that badly then they should be more than willing to pay a small price rather then randomly just pressing a fucking button would you want to live in a world where someone can just hold their hands up and vote to have you put to death just because just a vote for no reason that costs them nothing to do ether lose the end of dungeon loot or have a limited number of votes in a certain time frame like vote per runs so you want to be sure not to waste it on stupid shit you want to save it for the really bad ones
wow,removed,no one dropped below life should i wait for the entire group before i start to kill a level critter too it was easily doable no one died no one even got low on health it was done without a single issue why would i wait should i also make sure everyone has flasks up check and make sure everyone has the right enchants and that all their secondary stats are bis in every slot before pulling a trash pack too that might be how you run things but kicking someone for performing their duties without anyone dying is stupid
wow,removed,was a priest healer he died on a pack when someone pulled a ton of extra mobs behind us then while he was running back i went to kill a couple single bears on the way to her phase then killed her phase one then went and waited at the boss location till healer got back and instead of taking the same route we cleared trash witch is fairly directy he pulled like adds and wiped us then i get kicked because apparently it is a sin to not fully clear that massive room of needless trash
wow,removed,i havent insulted you once youre calling me a retard what the actual fuck
wow,removed,better attitude you act as if of the time the people who are doing the kicking are perfect angels of human beings and the person always who was voted against is always the bad guy if there was nazis and cripples in a room who is going to win the vote kick the problem is that it is done for free with zero concern if what you say is true and that i was such a massive menace to the success of the group then the people who vote to kick should have absolutely no problem forfeiting a part of their rewards for the trade off they can get someone else and finish the dungeon at a faster pace i have yet to see a single comment in this entire thread with a single argument against my proposed idea and only people bashing me that somehow i must have deserved it how all it takes is a single mouse button click you dont need to deserve anything for someone to just press a button hell some people will see a popup and just randomly click without reading it please tell my why it is bad that someone should actually want to kick someone in order to kick someone instead of just doing it for fun you could queue as friends then on last boss pull kick someone for the hell of it also your whole attitude thing does not make a lot of sense it is more about having a personality type in light with the other people in the group rather than being good say if you were in a group of basement virgins having someone talk about how much they get laid they will probably get kicked if you were in a party with a bunch of cops and ur talking about smokin weed you will probably be kicked if you are in a party with a bunch of angry people and you said he guys how is it going lets all have fun he would probably be kicked sorry but i am not going to change who i am as a person to make other random people feel good about themselves the content of ones personality should never be in question in a dungeon run only their actual actions on the success of the group so if someone is afk for a long time kick them if a tank is seriously under geared or only is wearing dps gear and keeps dying sure kick him because you cant possibly clear the dungeon without themi was clearing stuff without ahealer so no problem there if you have a dps whoes damage is so bad and you are stuck on a boss with a dps check then sure kick them but kicking someone just because you dont like them is stupid kicking someone also because they are not an esports raider is also stupid like i said there was othe rpeople in the group who kept pulling trash i did not start screaming lets kick them the instant after they pulled these packs and instead ignored it and kept going on because they were still good enough to at least kill the bosses and not stand in the fire would you not agree if someone was being a significant hinderance that it would be worth it to pay to have them leave also can you answer me this is this system foolproof and absolutely never punishes someone who did not deserve it is it incapable of being exploited by trolls
wow,removed,again another person who is not actually answering my question why not have a cost to cast your vote it is easy to vote someone out of a group if it means nothing to you at all majority vote does not mean much what if the whole group was only angry basement dwellers and you got someone happy in the group or some guy out dpsd oneof your friends and you all vote kick him there is absolutely no system in place to prevent abuse i would rather be spawn camped for minutes on a pvp server than be vote kicked out of a group cause it gives you a deserter debuff again the problem is there is nothing to prevent someone from abusing the system what in the world is wrong with it costing the end reward if it is really that severe you need to remove this person from the group surely thatis a small price to pay
wow,removed,it is stressful for a healer to not heal someone who does not need it what so wait a second if i dont like someones play style i should leave but if someone does not like my play style shouldnt they also leave also that makes no sens so your saying iif i was in a group and i wanted to kill a level critter i should wait for a healer because that is basically what a lot of trash is in these places just critters that can be killed easily without a healer
wow,removed,well only a few times but that is enough to be really madening not only to lose out on the end reward but other bosses you worked hard to get to but also you are locked out of any dungeons for there is no reason to kick someone unless it is a last resort to salvage a run its good the system is there but its fucking stupid that anyone can do it for free with no consequences it would be like saying if in real life there was people in a room and guy made a bad joke people vote to kill him and then the cops came and they said well it was a majority vote then the cops go oh well ok so long as everyone agreed to it no you kill someone you have to pay consequences if you vote kick someone there should be some sort of a downside to prevent abuse that is mainly what i am talking about here abuse and i dont understand why people think it is ok to ostracize someone for simply being different than they are i can understand if they are holding the group back significantly but anything other than that there is no reason to kick someone
wow,removed,so you would be fine if you were a nice guy who knew your class well who never got on anyones nerves joined a group of trolls and vote kicked you for laughs when at the last boss because that is democracy why would you fuck up on purpose to be vote kicked you would just be wasting your time also that is completely stupid i like how you just automaitcally assume that the people starting the vote just have to be good people no matter what and the person who is being voted against no matter waht is always a criminal who deserved it even in your example it is stupid to have it only cost a single button click to get rid of someone you could literally vote kick someone who did more dps than you or somehow who has a cooler transmog then you or maybe someone has a transmog into lvl gear and you think it is stupid and dont like it kick you can kick someone for any reason under the sun when the only possible reason to ever kick someone is if they are massively hindering the progress of the group and the only way you can achieve that without abuse is to have it cost something why is that so bad i dont understand you also act like the only reason to ever kick someone is if it is extremely bad beyond all hope but that is not the case you can vote kick people for the most mundane simple of bullshit and that is the problem maybe if the system was working fine it wouldnt need to be changed but it doesnt and is being abused this is why we cant have nice things argument it would be nice if it were like that if everyone used it properly but people dont i have also seen other people kicked for stupid reasons
wow,removed,also like i said in an earlier post that you can also have it be a cooldown it has to be limited in some way to stop people from abusing it i mean if you really feel that majority rule is always right do you then support the nazis because they all voted to kill cripples and jews if the majority said so they must have had a good reason for it right
wow,removed,they are not being punished they are trading kicking someone else to make run go faster they still get boss drops from rest of bosses in dungeon while person kicked gets absolutely nothing and is banned from dungeons for lol less than times i only beenkicked like or times but its enough to piss me off when i dont deserve it i love how you just assume like everyone the people starting the vote is always without fail somehow the good guys while the person being voted on is always the bad guy i dont get it is there some kind of cosmic quantum mechanic that physically stops bad people and trolls or salty pricks from clicking the vote kick button or something i was kicked one run right at the very start of a run because i chose to start on a pack of trash that someone didnt want me to go on like they got legitimatly angry that i pulled this specific pack of trash instead of another pack of trash because the other pack was at least according to him a few seconds faster and your solution is no solution ether the entire point of the kick system is to get a replacement for your group if someone is so bad that there is no way you can clear the dungeon without leaving and starting over and if that is the case then it should be a blessing that you can sacrifice your end reward witch really is not that big to begin with the system is not meant to be abused and to just randomly kick anyone you feel like whenever you want for any reason under the sun maybe if it was used the way it was intended it would not be a problem but its not its like when you have kids and you cant have nice things because your kids will always break it its why police and laws exist its why banks have security and vaults if people never abused other people then there would never been any point of having laws or police but people do just like not all police are good guys not all people who vote kick are good guys ether it is a system that is being abused with absolutely zero repercussions for doing so and if you not wanting to lose out on the massive bonus for doing a heroic dungeon then clearly the person you want to kick is clearly not that fucking bad if the though of you losing less than gold makes you go woa nah ill just deal with it like be real here
wow,removed,if you are not willing to forfeit gold and of an artifact level then clearly they were not doing anything that wrong to begin with they at least have chance at gear upgrades when the person kicked gets nothing if you are unwilling to sacrifice such an extremely small fucking reward then the person you are wanting to kick is clearly not worth it and if they then it was worth it i dont get the issue here i guess you have to be kicked for a bullshit reason and have your real life time wasted for nothing first to be angry about it
wow,removed,and your attitude right now is not bad again if you are not willing to lose a measly gold then that person was not doing anything seriously wrong this is such a simple fucking concept what dont you get you can get gold skinning a single mob you say it i was doing something wrong like i raped a small child and act as if you could never possible get kicked from any dungeon im going to say it again if gold is too much worth to kick someone then they clearly were not much of a hinderance to the group and therefor should not be kicked if it is worth it then its not really a huge loss you can get what like gold an hour if u farm for gold in this patch it would be like getting pissed off you have to pay penny to cross a bridge or something
wow,removed,well i dont like you if i get you in a group im going to kick you on the last boss then laugh when you whisper me in anger to why you got kicked its like this entire reddit is filled with people with iq the fucking issue is that the system is being abused you fucking twat how many fucking times do i have to say it
wow,removed,same reason or a popup went up on their screen or they just click accept without reading it or they are friends or from same server or any reason at all why do people rob banks kill rape steal why do people jump out of air planes without a parachute why do people do anything are you saying that the abuse of the vote kick system is not a problem and there should be absolutely zero mechanics put into place to prevent or at least greatly diminish the abuse of the system
wow,removed,nobodys assuming anything dumbass you said blood sweat and tears when talking about collecting those feathers which translates to i worked really super hard on that guys get over yourself
wow,removed,yes they are special need
wow,removed,majority decision is not good enough when its being abused you stupid fuck if majority of people were assholes and just wanted to kick someone doing nothing wrong is that justified so are you saying the system as it is now is perfect with no need to change
wow,removed,so if me and of my friends saw you in a dungeon you would be perfectly fine with the majority to kick you out of the party with no reason other than just not liking you having absolutely nothing to do with your performance in the actual dungeon
wow,removed,no the system was not put in to make peoples epeens feel good or when special snowflakes get flustered when someone says a word at them when they make a massive mistake it was put in so that you could remove people out of the party that ether makes the dungeon run so mind numbingly slow or makes it impossible to progress farther into the dungeon not to follow the random whims of people to troll and hurt other players time these are the only reasons why anyone should be kicked from a group kicking someone because they trigger you is not a good reason to waste another human beings time if you were in a room with other people and people told you to kill yourself would you do it since you seem to worship the idea of majority opinion no matter what the outcome is and if you are not willing to give up atifact power and gold then clearly you dont really give a fuck if they are in the group or not i dont think you are understanding me if you are causing massive disruptions and the majority want to kick you fine but not over the most possibly stupid and minor bullshit if you are going to fuck over another player it should be for a good reason slavery of a minority groups benefits the majorityshould we do that
wow,removed,wait so whats the point and going to get these orbs if u find them all u get the mount
wow,removed,people griefing the last orb you are really pissing me off

wow,removed,maybe youre aware of this but on reddit if something gets downvoted a lot it gets hidden the point of this system is to prevent irrelevant or offtopic comments or duplicate comments a sideeffect of this system is that opinions can often be buried if enough people disagree with them or if a few people get the downvotes in early enough this is why when you downvote something on this subreddit you see the popup that reads dont downvote something just because you disagree with it im not upset with people that want the new silence system as i understand where youre coming from im not going to downvote your comment that says good riddance to all the fcking trolls but i want my opinion to be heard too that is what free speech is that we get to hear all opinions and decide for ourselves what we think is best i dont care if you disagree with me but i do get made if you try to silence me

wow,removed,honestly thats your own fault for being ignorant they have not been subtle about saying that the artifacts would be able to be upgraded more in the future and they said you wouldnt be able to do it if you didnt have the paragon traits because they dont want people to save all their ap you might not like it and you can complain all you want but you shouldve expected it
wow,removed,it takes an hour at most to do all the ap world quests that spawn per win is a lot pve doesnt give this like amazing amount of ap do you even know what youre talking about raid bosses arent even guaranteed to drop an ap token and theyre half of what youd get for an rbg win know what youre talking about before you annoy me with your complaints you realize most pve players are at the same point in their weapons that pvpers are right right god is this forum just filled with people who love to complain before even knowing what they are talking about if you dont like it then dont play the game no one will care if you dont if you dont enjoy it dont waste your time
wow,removed,youre the idiot who didnt put ap into their main spec you have no right to insult any one elses intelligence lol
wow,removed,i fully understand mind your own business if you dont
wow,removed,lol based on your comment history you just like to make stupid arguments and fight with everyone so i am going to completely ignore you from now on fuck off idiot
wow,removed,if all you do is solely instanced pvp then you are going to get fucked this game isnt something that rewards people who only do thing blizzard doesnt want you to solely do instanced pvp blizzard never said theyd never raise the cap on the traits allowed in pvp and it shouldve fucking obvious to anyone with a brain that theyd eventually make the higher traits work in pvp since blizzard has clearly stated that you need to cap out your paragon to have access to the new artifact traits in so shut the fuck up you fucking moron go cry about how much you suck in pvp somewhere else because no one fucking cares
wow,removed,nah youre pretty retarded theres nothing more casual than pvpers other than lfr raiders or pet battlers in fact a large reason why the hardcore pve community had such a backlash against blizzard a long time ago was because of stupid bullshit like pvp gear on pve loot tables or having the game balanced around pvp and have it effect pve in the worst ways dont even compare it to the fact that pvpers bitched and complained they couldnt get any good gear at all except in pve which lead to the creation of pvp gear in general
wow,removed,always funny watching people using the word cuck unironically mainly because they almost always use it incorrectly
wow,removed,yeah but can i transfer between accounts i mean
wow,removed,not because its the truth but because youre a dick the only people bothered by noobs getting gear above their level are epeen focused narcissists what do you care if a noob has half decent gear if youre worth half of what you think you are gear shouldnt even matter to you anymore
wow,removed,one of the appearances yes and also yes you need this one in order to be able to unlock the othersthis is the skin the others are just extra colors
wow,removed,your autism isnt blizzards problem
wow,removed,holinka should get max level cancer next
wow,removed,youre an idiot this change was not put on the ptr it was not discussed aside from the fact that its a boneheaded decision anyway there was zero communication about this strict pvpers have been stopping artifact power grinds at level since thats where according to holinka they stopped being effective its a slap in the face
wow,removed,

wow,removed,yo you made this claim saying their was anything to begin with this video calls you out as a liar

wow,removed,i considered that as well but unfortunately the main secondaries for disc and holy are diametrically opposed you would practically need two full sets of gear holy prioritizes mastery in order to capitalize on echoes of light and haste is our worst stat disc prioritizes haste in order to get more out of penance and purge the wicked and shorten the cd on pwshield and their second to worst stat is mastery the only thing the two specs have in common is crit but a holy priest low in mastery has poor effectiveness as does a disc priest low in haste
wow,removed,oh so we all have to understand your feelings we all have to understand that you went to the other part of world thousands of miles away from your home to kill ppl under we are here to help flag you and others like you are responsible for millions of destroyed lives cultures and ethnic groups you should feel like piece of shit and i hope you never find a rest and never again feel any kind of joy

wow,removed,be that as it may that corroborated the fact that the worst stat for holy is the best stat for disc and therefore you need almost two full sets of gear
wow,removed,hey man im having the same kind of problem i havent done questing through the zones but ive been trying to experience the endgame content and scenarios to little luck some fights like that amber cunt in heart of fear the eye boss in throne of thunder and galakras in siege of orgrimmar is impossible to solo at least for me and for some reason i cant enter the pandaria scenarios i really just started looking in to this last sunday so i havent really done any research asked some friends about these bosses thats all im playing horde side on eudeathwing if you want to check it out together send me pm for realid
wow,removed,and trunks dendee marron in dragonball z rayne in bloodrayne chunli in street fighter iv akali in league of legends christine and starlet in fallout new vegas rivera in halo persephone in skylanders giants lady comstock in bioshock infinite blaze the cat in the sonic franchise lucina in super smash bros wii ioreth in middle earth shadow of mordor wonder woman in lego batman gwyn whitehill in game of thrones bianca davri in dragon age inquisition and well a bunch more smaller roles shes awesome apparently her husband met her when she was taking one of his classes and he recognized her voice acting credit in funimation asking her to talk to her people to see if he could get a tryout she didnt but they ended up together anyway
wow,removed,but you should just bind strafe to a and d because who the fuck uses a and d to turn i typically hold down ad to rotate in place when i heal in lfr especially when i use chain heal it makes me look like a blue humanoid ribbon pole
wow,removed,sure is better but youre talking as if everyone who uses special characters have names like this d̙̜̞͖̥̬͇̮̓̿̄ͨ̐͌͡oͣ̍̈҉̵͕͍̠͉͇̹̦v̡̢̞̻̯͔̳̖̙̠ͣ̆͒ͥͬ̔̿͞e̯̯̭͈̳̺͕̱ͭ̈͐ͣ̈́͜͠r̵̹̦̪̫͙̾̅͒̽b̌̍̍͆͏̣̼̭o̧͖̥̹͈̯͍͔̙͛ͧͅy̌̆ͫ̆҉̧̰͓͉̯̺̼͢ ̴̘̩̺̺͔̳͐ͭ͂͗̅̾ͅ ̥̠̞ͥ̽̊ͯͫͧ̃ also that first letter you wrote is from my language
wow,removed,troll try harder you little bitch fucking idiot
wow,removed,strapped for time and lack of fucks so suck a dick
wow,removed,i could link my build if you would likeim actually running a dualcore that is oc at ram oc gtx ssc ssd all settings maxed at around fps will dip around when i port into dal but then go back up its been flawless so far further notes about the build if anyone wants itafter hours my cores never get about and my gpu never sees above
wow,removed,i know thats why i apologized before hand because i didnt have time to think about how to word what i wanted to say properly and nor did i have the time to correct for grammar or lack of words but there was no need to be a cunt about it was my problem with him
wow,removed,i dont see why you guys want one firstly getting all hyped for it will only make it disappointing if its not a secondly you know theyre going to shoehorn in sjw shit and make jaina some black feminist or something if you saw the warcraft movie you saw how retarded and cringeworthy that sister of lothar was expect more of that
wow,removed,nice
wow,removed,couldve answered two more tickets with quick tothepoint responses in that time
wow,removed,youre a fucking idiot the title says family and full time job not girl that comes over a few times a week
wow,removed,not gonna happen that blizzard isnt going to even begin looking at this until well after legion is underway
wow,removed,you dont even know what a beer league is lol jesus christ youre a fucking loser
wow,removed,j allen brack appears are you prepared for this presentation you think you do but you dont then they unveil a hd remaster of vanilla wow
wow,removed,based on your comment i wager you hear where on the spectrum are you because youre autistic
wow,removed,look at the math you autist i obviously meant night of the week and not weeknight
wow,removed,you sure used one specific example a lot to then try to claim it didnt happen just quit while youre behind kiddo nobody cares but you
wow,removed,adolf hitler never said that i was a retard
wow,removed,get the fuck out of here with your clickbait please
wow,removed,yeah it is except its not called darkshire heres a snippet of a map in the movie this one is mostly true to the lore we know karazhan the tower shown is now to the south west of deadwind pass stonecairn lake in northern elwynn forest is directly west of deadwind pass while in the game itd be to the north north of the karazhan tower you can vaguely make out grand hamlet this is the village later known as darkshire it is in the movie in southern elwynn forest so pretty lore accurate ish bonus temple of atalhakkar can be seen in the lake of swamp of sorrows
wow,removed,nah
wow,removed,congrats dude he won you got butt mad and he had a nice laugh in his computer chair also nobody cares
wow,removed,from my experience the only thing i was able to get was the gpddamn penguin from the mail which is stuff you have pruchased within the game promotional items have always required an active account unless it was to promote leveling ie wows anniversary token i am not acting the victim i am actually being even more of a bully because you seem like a sensitive little shit sjw who thinks you are doing something for calling someone a bully on the internet newsflash to you the question is not reasonable and there is nothing better than a sjw thinking theyve done anything other than add to the cesspool of retardation you wake up and ill stop being a douchebag when people gt their head out of their ass and think for two goddamn seconds before they blurt nonsense from the shithole they call a mouth
wow,removed,i am protagonist pls no were a day guildcurrently two day clearing only tuesthursunday were looking for quality dps who can dps while seething corruption is happening if you cant do that dont apply we prefer that you have a microphone are able to communicate on a basic level and understand that if you fuck up you will take responsibility for it magesroguelockboomkin who parse above percentile on most fights with respectable kill times ilvl doesnt matter if you can perform you will get gear since most ofus dont need any loot at this point and are just farming mounts at this point we wont shy away from other dps if you perform at a high level and execute mechanics properly while able to dps at the same time were not in need of any healers atm since we two heal every fight besides mannotyrantgore our schedule usually is tuesday mannoarch whatever else we want to do thursday rest of whatever we gotta do blackhand for the mount were pretty chill our raid leader is cute irl so that always works and he loves anime so if you want to join hit him up on bnet
wow,removed,he sounds like an rtard
wow,removed,they probably dont wanna give achievements out to downies who cant even spell didnt right
wow,removed,op i was in your guild equivalence we did mythic socrathar together then after i won the roll on the tier you removed me from the group and guild
wow,removed,fuck multiboxers retards ftfy

wow,removed,give your login to a friend

wow,removed,play whatever you enjoy you will do better dps then all of the flavor of the month rerollers regardless and you wont be far behinde people that just happened to play currently op class
wow,removed,can i get link to the post saying that the turtle wont be obtainable in legion
wow,removed,cute you should have seen the ships in nostalrius
wow,removed,its beyond that i came back a few weeks ago and there is a stark difference between how people act in heroics and levelling dungeons people calling each other names and being rude to one another kicking at the first sign of any trouble while in the heroics its just how it used in wrath you get in maybe one or two people say hi rarely everyone does most of time no one does and then thats all the communication that happens in the entire instance but while levelling damn its like playing league of legends so i dont think it has anything to do with it being server based or not i think its just a different mindset of people levelling and those in the max level heroicsmythics in lfr people dont communicate much but when theres someone afk its usually just pointing out that theyre afk not being completely vile about it but in the levelling dungeons it seems like many people are just waiting to pounce at the first sign of anything being not completely perfect i dont think anonymity has any part in it really these people act like this because they can going back to server only type grouping wouldnt solve that unless there was also widespread use of a blacklist addon that would share a blacklist with everyone else using it and automatically ignore said people which of course has a tonne of flaws in such an idea i think whats a better idea one that wouldnt make finding a levelling dungeon group a complete pain is accountwide ignoring and some kind of actual blizzard enforced penalty for being a twat some of these sort of people im sure are responsible for people just deciding to give up on wow while levelling why bother playing a game when you have what basically amounts to smurfs heirlooms running around in the dungeon with you trash talking you i mean thats what you get in lol and its awful but theres no incentive in game to not be a twat to new players someone holds you back just kick them fuck em not my problem right i just need to level fast right now like drivers who think they are smart by driving past everyone on a highway exit and cutting in right at the end probably causing more traffic behind them in that lane too fuck everyone else so long as i get my way i think maybe having something like the vote system after an overwatch match happen at the end of a dungeon would be cool you vote maybe even a couple of criteria pop up like in overwatch not sure what outside of most damage and so on but something and then you vote and they get a bit of extra xp and maybe a chance at an extra bag or bit of gold or something weight it so that people you never played with before voting for you give the most reward and those you play with a lot like people on your friends list or guild dont give as much to prevent any abuse from people trying to cheat the system to level faster theres probably other ways to incentivise it but i do think trying to promote good behaviour is something that would work better than trying to put these people in line by the threat of being blacklisted by the players on their server as would happen occasionally in vanilla
wow,removed,anyone who has an extra beta key shameless begging
wow,removed,whats gotten into you bruce
wow,removed,bruce jenner skin for humans but still no highborne
wow,removed,i get messages from multiple people all the time while im marked as away because then you risk offending the other person both of those things are their problemjesus just stop being such a bitch
wow,removed,you sound like you would be enjoying ruining the hackers fun should we start the paperwork on your murder too
wow,removed,a couple butthurt pussy neckbeards ftfy
wow,removed,well first off the fact i need to read a novel to justify ridiculous character changes in a video game is a stupid way for blizzard to handle it though they are obviously improving in that regard second i did and i still am not convinced the writers could have made a significant change in her character without removing her previous character personality the old jaina is gone rerolled a rogue and vanished im not saying that in a sense that shes changed im saying that in a sense that any of her past experiences before going batshit might as well have not happened all that stuff she did with thrall meh who cares stuff happened after that
wow,removed,fuck its pretty early here yes destruction sorry
wow,removed,i dont want to sound like hitler but idiots like these should be straight up shot on sight they literally pollute the earth just by not suffocating to think that this will continue during legion launch is pretty grim
wow,removed,theres nothing confusing in the text you just need to learn to read it will be available on the second week of legion retards nowadays
wow,removed,khanos not sure if ive spelt that right just outside of if is the best for xp do invasions then log out and back in when stage starts at the inn there and repeat got my level in around hours yesterday tag everything especially elites once youve done it a few times you will have a route set and will know what spawns where good luck
wow,removed,wrong
wow,removed,will take you about hours doing stages repeat ive tried using he stage method but is quicker xp
wow,removed,i cant believe you people pay a monthly fee to play this game and blizzard can not even keep the servers up
wow,removed,its a free country bro
wow,removed,u mad bro
wow,removed,starvation is very different from mount collecting on an online game
wow,removed,no but it put me off trying to earn one when anyone can just get one with no effort
wow,removed,sorry dr phil but no
wow,removed,you know nothing about but thanks you
wow,removed,took a break wanted to resub a little closer to legion release
wow,removed,it is actually far easier and tangental tangent tangential than that the solution is pulling pre existing content into compartments and assigning them a level range the story of arthus the story of omfg illidan is fucking goku i am not sucking on a purple dick after sucking on green dick for three expansions fuck me where was i oh well look no further that guild wars for a successful model the entire world need not change as frequently if the player understands what happened and in fact forms a personal attachment to what they know and then resist changing fixing it orc invasion more elf shit more orcs orcs trolls elves orcs orcs orcs orcs fucking hell can i just fucking side with jaina and kill the fucking asshole orcs i am tired of being invaded these guys are clearly fucking assholes they invade over and over why is jaina the crazy one fucking orcs orcs orcs orcs orcs i just make the orcs stop i fucken orcs always orcs always fucking orcs make the orcs stop kill them stop invading for fucks sake khadgar fix the fucking portal

wow,removed,there was a time when this game was a social game its not the case anymore you dont need to chat
wow,removed,i want the grill
wow,removed,im not being passive aggressive im being blunt the ignore and block features are inadequate and leaving them that way is a bad idea for business your idea is bad the ignore list has a limit entering a toxic atmosphere and hitting ignore one after the other after the other is not just extremely tedious but neverending since they all have alts and whoever takes the bait needs to be ignored too then the limit hits you if its trade chat you can just leave it if its every bg you enter you cant you need the chat panel open to communicate and strategize not with the new silencing feature you report the toxic people blizz reviews it and silences them the bait is no more your ignore list now only has the trolls themselves on it and the limit does not effect you you can even rejoin trade chat a its impossible to be offended by absolutely nothing thats silly youre trying to suggest that its possible to be immune to emotional abuse and humiliation thats not how humans function sorry its unrealistic
wow,removed,yeah i wonder why i dont use trademark infringement without counterfeiting in my everyday sentences s
wow,removed,you could call it treason as well if you like why not murder
wow,removed,typical lets just skip all this terms of use bs and get straight into the game cuz now i own wow xd i love people who try to sound smart about legal terms when they clearly have no idea of what the fuck are they talking about
wow,removed,people play on servers that try to deliver the game they once loved you stupid asshole
wow,removed,go back to gen disc and fap over nostalgia hate if you dont have a worthwhile argument you fucking loser
wow,removed,you paid for access to the servers you dont own shit
wow,removed,what they got bought
wow,removed,you dont own the game you bought a license to play it that can be revoked at any time for any reason
wow,removed,i love these posts its been proven that legacy servers are just not profitable and yet you cling to some notion that they are you say people will find a home elsewhere they have been finding a home since wow itself is just not the it game anymore and nost isnt going to change that
wow,removed,youre a retard bud he was never lead class designer hes always been in charge of balance
wow,removed,what turns me off more is the cancerous vanilla community constantly bashing blizzard for not giving them legacy and their constant whining about how vanilla is so much better than legion i enjoy both equally for their own reasons regardless of their flaws but youll never see me associating myself with a private server like elysium because of the community alone
wow,removed,i cant say i feel sorry for them this is well deserved
wow,removed,people truly belive that since they play current wow that they own the game and own all the rights of the game the same people who wanted to sue blizzard when they got banned for hacking in overwatch
wow,removed,no you purchased a license to be able to play on their servers
wow,removed,code isnt difficult to copyright what gave you that idea like any other creative work code is automatically covered under copyright law if you write novel code it is copyrighted in fact theres no legal way to avoid it putting something in the public domain voluntarily is notoriously tricky
wow,removed,top tier dk her doesnt work that way
wow,removed,implying nost was a hero to begin with
wow,removed,this is the type of thing that turns so many people off private servers another factor is the reasons you see coming out of people over this the constant i hope blizzard shuts down and blizzard is shit anyway comments it makes a lot of the private server players look like massive assholes theyre taking away my illegal server theyre literally worse than hitler just gets fucking old
wow,removed,they were more or less whiny brats upset that their illegal pirate server was cdd pretty much just used championing the vanilla experience as a excuse to qq and rage lol
wow,removed,that is nice but unfortunately for you most people dont give a shit and there is nothing you can do about it
wow,removed,fucking do the work and take the money you realize maintaining an mmos servers at a quality which blizzard would be accountable for would most likey cost a lot more than the revenue of subscribers alone right
wow,removed,if you bough them physically you purchased the media on which they are contained and any physical content you dont own any content provided by blizzard entertainment or any other game company for that matter its all covered under ip rights you simply have a lease to play their content for as long as they allow
wow,removed,blizz will have this on lockdown soon as well cant wait like it says theyre pirates and they know it
wow,removed,if you need your daily dose of autism this badly go watch keemstar

wow,removed,pretty fucking hilarious lads ass is getting spread open for being a downy
wow,removed,ps does anyone know if there are any major overall developments in the nostalrius story meetings legacy servers etc etc i cant state much considering the mods in this sub will go apeshit but the next big thing in the vanilla wow scene is crestfall its backed by a lot of the nost testers and its been in development for over four years its going to have clustering and cross realm bgs as well open beta begins late bug fixes etc with a launch sometime mid i cant really say anything more on this sub but its a huge project visit rwowservers for discussion on these topics
wow,removed,try a human warrior perfect fit for a boring retard
wow,removed,i need reddit gold to buy flasks someone hook me up
wow,removed,what youre gullible
wow,removed,jaina needs to go to rehab this is why everyone mocks liberals
wow,removed,damn not sure i can counter the urban dictionary definition of broken oh wait its still a stupid suggestion because that definition applies to equally dumb shit green items are pretty broken they give stats and are all around better items my white quality armor cant compare if i dueled a guy using those broken green quality items with my white items id lose without it even being close how can blizzard allow such a discrepancy in items to exist because clearly its no contest which one is better and competitive jesus christ dude just think about this for more than one second
wow,removed,hes using the word right other dudes an idiot
wow,removed,nobody gave you the right answer so here it is the game is fake now you can be on the auction house but you wont be on your realm and thats when you wont see a sold item in your auctions list often youll get an internal auction house error and you need to reload if youre lucky the game swapped you to your actual fucking realm and youll be able to see your sold auctions again this piece of shit dynamic game is unintuitive and fucking weird now i had to tell you this because the game doesnt

wow,removed,okay since you didnt get it heres a video i just made for you its like minutes long and i show you in real time what happens and why its a fake dumb game
wow,removed,good i hope those motherfuckers drop the soap in jail thatll teach them for all the stolen game time
wow,removed,thats not how that works
wow,removed,have a little derp to go with your autism
wow,removed,bye felicia
wow,removed,not to mention the gear youd lose which can always be an upgrade you dont actually lose anything though the gear you get for beating the timer is from the levels you skip by beating the timer
wow,removed,if you dont have a legendsry is because you dont care enough youre an idiot
wow,removed,yeah no plenty of quests give specific relic rewards that dont work for all specs i main resto and my loot spec is always resto but i get relics fro quests that are meant for my feral spec relics have been weird since launch
wow,removed,are we allowed to say that still i thought that was their word
wow,removed,start your own groups
wow,removed,well on us servers you can buy gold for which rounds to about you can buy upvotes for which rounds to about again rounding this means that one upvote is worth eight hundred and seventy seven wow gold httpwwwepictooncomwowgold httpboostupvotescom
wow,removed,haha fucking retard confirmed
wow,removed,yeah not sure why im being downvoted shits been broken since launch
wow,removed,emilyispro is a fucking faag
wow,removed,i know you were a gentleman gentlelady by hiding that pricks name but you should just show us who that tank and dps are so we know to stay away from those guys
wow,removed,lmao thats fucking autism
wow,removed,i was running a time walking throne of the tides with a jack ass tank the healer asked him to slow down and not pull so much the tank told the healer to fuck off and that hed do what he wanted so knowing the tank queues being long i had an ideawe only had the neptunian encounter left to do so i put up with his bull shit and his toxic attitude was harassing us talking about how much we sucked and how we needed him right up until neptunian empowers you theres a small point as the buff is being applied where youre not aggrod to the boss so i initiated a vote kick right at this time since you dont need a tank for killing the big squid guy vote passed tank was kicked before the encounter finished so hed have to run it again for his quest was in wod at the time
wow,removed,this sounds like my old guild they were family friendly for awhile but wanted to get serious in legion they kept the family friendly mindset not holding people accountable just saying to have fun but adopted the dickish mindset of this spec is bad we dont want it needless to say after getting denied a spot in the main mythic dungeon group before raids opened for being ret i transferred to a different server the same week that the ret buffs were announced the asshole guild leader adds me on battlenet expecting to at least get a good chuckle i accepted he starts bragging about how theyre normal and were willing to let me raid after the ret buffs i told him we were heroic and he called me a liar swnt him to my guilds wowprogress and he called me a fucking retard that got carried and removed me i love me some salty tears
wow,removed,sounds like someone was molested at a low level by a disc priest show us on this target dummy where you were touched
wow,removed,oh look its a retard in its natural habitat
wow,removed,trust me it would have worked the assholes wouldnt have read the name of the player getting kicked only the description
wow,removed,maybe you just suck dick at tanking
wow,removed,bitching about people posting a big indepth post and comparing it to lines of other people moaning makes you look retarded
wow,removed,what level are you
wow,removed,or you can stop acting like a pompous asshole and come into the real world there are bad players of every spec my guild has disc priests that play just fine get off your high horse and quit being a bitch
wow,removed,me and my roommate were in a group with people from another guild and server he was tanking and told the hunter to stop pulling so much because he wasnt very geared yet the hunter proceeded to try to vote kick with reason little bitch i vote no and raise my own vote to kick the hunter with reason lets just get a better tank those impatient bitches kicked their own guildie maybe they should slow down enough to read the name of whos being kick
wow,removed,nice troll attempt kid
wow,removed,yeah cross his name out and protect him instead of asking him to get in voice chat to dechip him
wow,removed,you literally dont read how does it not reduce the severity btw if it would otherwise hit you for your health total upfront that is pretty severe but staggering it out mitigates that damage im complimenting the class while pointing out its weaknesses and all you read is class sucks it sucks everyone useless waste of space you are
wow,removed,they come to everything we do and we almost never fail they raid with us they do mythics with us they also pvp with us til youre a fucking idiot
wow,removed,hes just an idiot i like fucking with idiots every now and then helps pass my work day
wow,removed,give the name so we dont stay in his group if we stumble upon him
wow,removed,fuck people like this you shouldnt have blocked out the name
wow,removed,time to make a new wow subreddit then with witchhunts and doxxing
wow,removed,you are such a terrible troll
wow,removed,if you say so kid you probably cant even tank normal
wow,removed,can we get some names and perma bans for the dumbasses who wouldnt allow the healer to heal a gd herioc dungeon
wow,removed,we shouldnt have to blur the name of douchebags like that guy to post it lol
wow,removed,ukizzamity you did this guy too much of a service by blanking out his and his friends name you should of left it uncensored so people could see who those shameful players are
wow,removed,blizzard protects griefers you cant name them cant shame them you can report them but nothing will happen they continue to grief dayin and dayout why because they pay a subscription fee
wow,removed,if you want to hands pick your team for a fucking heroic dungeonthen dont pug you utter retards seriously how the fuck are you people even trying to justify this shit with a straight face
wow,removed,i might have accidentally not blurred his name out
wow,removed,yeah it came off super arrogant like he felt he was the king of the group talking down to a peasant or something
wow,removed,i am a casual who pretends to be hardcore im not a dickhead though
wow,removed,i remember a post just yesterday about it granted that doesnt mean its a lot but still silly to make fun of someones ui especially if they are verifiably better at wow than you
wow,removed,why did you blank out their names i understand your own name but why blank theirs when theyre being a dick
wow,removed,i wish we could see his name so we could all make disc priests on his server and just spam him
wow,removed,youre doing this prick a favor by hiding his name people like that need to be exposed for the assholes they are
wow,removed,dont erase the damn name dude this bitch of a tank deserves every bit of harrasement coming his way
wow,removed,i think you should just go ahead and put his name out there tbh if youre a retard in public youve literally put yourself out there
wow,removed,how is this the official running of the gnomes post where theres an official running of the gnomes post on the front page right now you posted this hours after the other guy and he has upvotes and you have seems more like his is the official and you just wanted to try and steal some of the karma from him not cool mate
wow,removed,blizzard makes the name bigger to prevent these mistakes
wow,removed,what a fucking retard lol
wow,removed,should have left his name this guy and his little echo need to be on everyones ignore list toxic af
wow,removed,why would you censor his name everybody should know who not to invite as a tank next time
wow,removed,people like this should not have the right of having their names hidden for anonymity purpose
wow,removed,good job screenshotting that quest text
wow,removed,his cringe online girlfriend supports him in this too im sorry hun he hates discs people like this should have their name shown in these posts for mass shaming
wow,removed,why censor their names let us cleanse them from the herd
wow,removed,why is there a no name and shame policy again idiots like this deserve to be on everyones ignore list
wow,removed,lol show us the name this level of dumbassery deserves recognition
wow,removed,ah well he acts like a retard all the time so that makes it ok you know
wow,removed,i say you repost this without the name blocked
wow,removed,i dont get it its only witchhunting if the person didnt actually do anything wrong so why cant op post this players name when they obviously have
wow,removed,is there a rule that makes people hide the nicknames in these posts i kind of want the nickname of that prick
wow,removed,so is that supposed to mean something do you always base your opinions on that of celebrities critical thinking sure is a rare gem on the internet
wow,removed,they didnt explain makgora and its a big factor
wow,removed,all you retards downvoting me haha its a shit system that you cant get the quest item again that week for killing again if you deny that you clearly have autism
wow,removed,your talking about talent choices not how easy it is to change talents the current system makes it easier to change talents the new system puts more restrictions on it but that makes it less annoying you make sense
wow,removed,wer den film nicht gut fand hat den fußball nie geliebt
wow,removed,afk in your garrison spam lfr while afking in garrison uninstall game after realizing how shit it is play on private servers
wow,removed,do not i repeat do not waste your time on this pile of shit game the moment you hit max level you will be bored within month
wow,removed,now you uninstall the game and play on private servers because the live version is shit
wow,removed,medivh dies o
wow,removed,yea its called misreading dipshit i literally owned up to my mistake so shut the fuck up i read it as he just opens chests before theyve been looted before and only finds food
wow,removed,you are absolutely retarded lol
wow,removed,a cuck is a non trump voter right s
wow,removed,god i hate this xkcd
wow,removed,no you didnt you lying piece of shit season ended on the same date the prepatch launched sources
wow,removed,this is almost endearing hahaha
wow,removed,uuuuuh im a whiny little bitch uuuuh
wow,removed,who is crying if you are a child that insults the game provides a tool to report ignore etc end of the story you insult you get reported assholes that agree with toxic behavior are probably pathetic individuals that belong to the ignore list anyway
wow,removed,hope his random comment didnt trigger your fee fees
wow,removed,this looks like the kind of retarded buggy shit people do on private servers but hey have fun with pretending youre in an anime finding the hidden areas of the mmo you cant log out of
wow,removed,youre right on an individual scale its not a big issue its even funny in an absurdist way but anyone who has played this game since the beginning has seen the community go from overwhelmingly welcoming and friendly and close knit to cancerous and more akin to league of legends and it really erodes away at people who are still the type to be friendly
wow,removed,ekowraith is bis legendary
wow,removed,for real man i officially retired from regular raiding opting to help my guild if necessary i had quit wow after hfc and honestly what used to be a very capable softcore raiding team at the start of wod is now a shadow of its former self if i didnt like the guild members as much as i do id have already moved guildsservers and im on the fence right now mostly because of how bad they did at normal en my guild got nythendra down on the first night spent the rest wiping to ilgy night two they got ilgy elerenthe and ursoc i was with them night one filling in as a replacement tank but their tank showed up so i was out for night two i pugged into a group with the lfg title nigga nigga bitch nigga nigga and join if you have a big penis and we downed the dreamsmen and cenarius with only a couple wipes on dragonscenarius since a lot of us had never done the fights before or even much research going in we just made shitty meme jokes the whole time and killed bosses
wow,removed,anyone who plays a pandaren should be shot
wow,removed,no donald trump you cant

wow,removed,are you implying it is hard wtf it may be bosses maybe even more and its funny you didnt know that they werent drop rate because your too lazy to actually do the content instead you want to argue online killing lfr is only had when you get spergs like you
wow,removed,tell him to do raids in the looking for retards queue
wow,removed,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee not everything is working perfectly in the first month of a new expansion better whine about it on the forums like the entitled little shit that i am
wow,removed,nah that nigga dead
wow,removed,how many fucking weeks will us have this stupid fucking pet god fucking damnit fuck shit cunt
wow,removed,if something is designed to feel overtuned then thats just poor design sure itll be better in months but who cares theres a wide gulf between finishing traits in a month and grinding days of dailies per trait
wow,removed,youre actually a little bitch
wow,removed,eu cucks triggered lul
wow,removed,who is the rtard now son

wow,removed,so you cant address any points i make youre the type of player who bitches when people die in a heroic i guarantee it
wow,removed,friend of mine wrote a ticket and complained about the whole thing that ppl seeing the movies are not getting gametime or anything he got accused of insulting the gm he then used the survey to rate everyone as bad as possible as response to that a leadsupport contacted him which gave him a free copy of the digital deluxe legion addon he already had the normal version preordered so he made €
wow,removed,
wow,removed,kys
wow,removed,timing a dungeon in mythic isnt very polite and your group will quickly find out this fact regardless of what you say
wow,removed,lol nice impression of the op i bet he dont know what a heroic mode is cause lfr lets u skip it lol
wow,removed,no im saying i didnt see the news you dense asshole why would i try to debunk a post thats been made public
wow,removed,damn bruh you salty
wow,removed,you sound like the kind of person that unnecessarily comments on everything jist like me aka go fuck yourself too
wow,removed,well there arent dozens of graphs sims and performance logs indicating you play the worst fucking spec in the game and anybody with any knowledge about warlocks at all know that aff has a lot of ramp up time but is easily comparable to other specs in most situations unlike frost
wow,removed,obviously if you dont just mind your own fucking business all the fucking twats will come out to play and shit on you for trying to be social in a fucking mmo
wow,removed,logs say otherwise fucking idiot
wow,removed,no shit now i just get to be irrationally pissed off cuz i cant call the stupid frost mage a bitch to his fucking face and smash it in with a hammer thanks for reminding me of my issues though i always fucking love it when every fucking person i talk to does that
wow,removed,naaaai win every time i take a few hits sure but she usually ends up gagged hands cuffed behind her back and with her ass up face down obedient little bitch
wow,removed,could always watch a video or two and try your best not to waste other peoples time
wow,removed,what does she stay on coms and provide moral support
wow,removed,⚘ spot a problem httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetokaze
wow,removed,aww he linked noxxic thats adorable
wow,removed,lol no lothar wasnt a paladin lothar was the knightchampion of stormwind
wow,removed,is there a reason that the loot is generated upon chest opening and not automatically after boss kill it seems like a fairer system but statistically speaking from what you are saying it is the same why would they change the way the system works for chest looting and secondly does the players bad luck prevention come into play with looting ie if a player has not received a drop due to bad luck for a period of time does his loot chance increase this would indeed skew the chest looting and make the playing field unlevel for the rest of the group since not all players will have similar bad luck prevention coefficients
wow,removed,i think its time to pull up your big boy pants and realize youre on the internet tiger no one cares about your feelings
wow,removed,true i would just like it better if they were more forward about these things i find it morally reprehensible that they are not but then again the current state of business in our world doesnt really seem concerned about morality unfortunately which is sad because you can still be profitable while being moral i think our government is far too overreaching and far too dysfunctional and stupid but if there is one thing i would like to see them regulate it would be the morality of businesses morality insofar as meaning good for human nature some of the addictive greed and fear exploiting design that wow uses is shameful and i think they know it it does bring in more money but i think in the long run it will be destructive to their business i find the casino business to be similar in the long term unless they change their management techniques and ror expectations and drives they will not be able to keep future generations and eventually the old money will dry up one positive example imo of something wow did recently that is good for human nature is allowing nodes to be temporarily looted by more than one player i think it cuts down on the toxicity and foma syndrome that this game stealth supported in order to drive revenue
wow,removed,sure i really dont care its not happening to me when i pug so its obviously something theyre doing they need to stop being a victim and find a way to improve skilled players dont get yelled at in pugs and if they do i bet they laugh it off because the person yelling is worse than them
wow,removed,people are offended by every single thing so fuck em even trying to be civil you get told to fuck off by the person youre trying to help so guess what asshole shit players likely helped create this atmosphere
wow,removed,theyre just words not even vocal its text in a box from a digital avatar how weak are people that youre upset by that
wow,removed,the post is less shittier compared to your shitforbrains comment now go kys hehe xd
wow,removed,dont listen to these qq pussies only not shit rogue spec right now and even then its still not good ridiculous assass was dominating in the wow regional tourney you will have a bad time with pallies but that is what arena is all about no one classteam reigns supreme outlaw and sub are good as well between the eyes is still badassgouge and blind sub can pull a lot of outplays but you definitely need points invested in the tree this guy does a lot of rogue videos that are pretty in depth and cover all the specs and talent builds good luck keep ya head up
wow,removed,ooooh shit son you sure did you shitlord
wow,removed,and in that case suck it the fuck up seriously why does everyone have to be the victim you fucked up own up to it and apologize if someone jumps down your throat who the fuck cares
wow,removed,who cares if youre told to kill yourself seriously its no one elses job to tip toe around anyone elses feelings in a game full of strangers if you get upset by it thats on you and you need to fix it the community wont change so either get over it or leave because you cant handle it
wow,removed,how nice for you but no one likes being harassed you seem to keep confusing come on man step it up your dps is bad dude getting kicked or i think youre doing something wrong in your rotationstop pulling mobs which is how normal non sociopaths give flak to poor performers with death threats and colossal rage tantrums its not unusual or wrong for these things to really get under peoples skin theyre not thin skinned theyre human all in all you sound like a colossal twat
wow,removed,as the father of a son who was killed by sticks and stones comments like yours are truly ignorant immoral and immature if only people were as mature and educated as me then the world would be a better place thank you also how dare you im outraged
wow,removed,i like how youre standing on a cliff about to end it
wow,removed,i got anger of the half giants on my main last week get your cuck choker outta here bro
wow,removed,someone randomly told me they wanted to eat my ass the other day i told them they were being vulgar
wow,removed,alternatively get fucked by rng and not get a legendary at all even though you have been since the first week on alts running as much content as you can i fucking love rng
wow,removed,not even close to mad nice try degenerate
wow,removed,if i see exodar or ragnaros i instantly leave i dont want to be paired up with a bunch of people yelling in spanish at me for whatever reason
wow,removed,who cares stop making this reddit another tumblr with post of how someone was so mean to me on the internet
wow,removed,no balls you wont do it
wow,removed,valid but once you whisper me all public etiquette goes out the window since we are now in private and in private i hope your socks are always wet and think your taste in music is trash
wow,removed,because hes asking something that can wasily be googled
wow,removed,great to hear he likes it dont be hard on yourself you are a good dad
wow,removed,post it in the daddit sub
wow,removed,right in the feels try other games with him
wow,removed,it is almost as if they buffed everyones chance for their first legendary
wow,removed,no and fuck off its a fucking game everything should be about making it fun if thats not their design purpose then this isnt the business for them
wow,removed,then theyre bad ill end with one too dumbass
wow,removed,so original retard
wow,removed,he likely noticed wrathions crusade against the rest of the black dragonflight well their lives do matter
wow,removed,its the goddamn jews again make wow great again build a auschwitz to keep the jews in
wow,removed,im not sure what sperg out means however as to the other portion of your comment i didnt ignore anything in fact i expounded on your initial statement by clarifying that none of these changes are final and are in fact meant specifically to test the numbers of the spec before anything is actually put to paper the entire premise of these changes to fire is to smooth out the damage throughout the fight as opposed to having everything frontloaded within combustion as i stated the point of contention that i was making is that your argument that fire mages arent looking too hot is very onesided and doesnt take into account specific changes being made to the other spells of the spec which will help to smooth out the actual throughput youre putting down an entire spec of the class because you cant see the forest for the trees and in regards to someone asking about how mages are standing up in terms of other classes i stand by my point in that you dont know what youre talking about
wow,removed,well at least you showed you arent butthurt
wow,removed,tard
wow,removed,exactly equipped im equipped bags my point was top guilds with top players do not waste time in en normal especially for a chance at legendaries keep being salty
wow,removed,im gunna guess that this is you httpwwwwowprogresscomcharactereuamanthultaleria you havent even entered mythic so stfu
wow,removed,we are hated by blizzard we keep getting dicked for no reason let me tell you from the beggining of legion they introduce a cool new spec with pistol and a grappling hook and everyone is so excited for it most of the rogues roll outlaw and start enjoying it but blizzard is like nope nerfed it to the ground at the week of en now everyone who dedicated over a month of gameplay to outlaw and griding ap for the weapon is forced to switch to either assassinaation or subtlety grinding ap and gear with different stats all over again and now they are planning to nerf subtlety and assassination to the fcking ground by outlaw is still shit and the other two are also going to become shit
wow,removed,stop being crazy
wow,removed,youre still an ass
wow,removed,you are a disgusting creature kill yourself and make the world a better place
wow,removed,he is not in europe look at his screenshot it says tuesday nov if youre gonna try to call someone out try not to be such a moron

wow,removed,idiot
wow,removed,orcs din do nuffins dey was good bois
wow,removed,cynical answer wow taught me that everyone is a closet sexist and that their collective favorite word is cuck real answer i definitely got leadership experience from dungeonraid leading

wow,removed,read the lore scrub
wow,removed,very touching story i wish the best for you and yours he draws better than most his age
wow,removed,how to get attention on rwow make a post crying about how the internet touched me or how i cant get anyone to take me in a group despite the fact that im playing a bad spec poorly geared have no class knowledge or fightdungeon knowledge and blame it all on the other guy sure harassment does happen to everyone but sweet jesus sometimes it is your fault sometimes its not about you as a person and its about the fact that youre just not doing what should be expected on anyone how many more times is this fucking feels bullshit going to be posted here its almost a damned meme at this point isnt there a sub dedicated to you people circlejerking to this kind of crap wwwredditcomrwowcirclejerk
wow,removed,well at least we know one thing for sure about your son he is prepared d happy legion adventures to you both

wow,removed,yeah because that is what matters not the other of the game
wow,removed,grow up
wow,removed,alright i tell you what im in a fabulous mood tonight so ill help you out lets brofessor this up shall we okay so that picture is of a forest please feel free to open the picture in a new tab and look as we carry on now looking at it and knowing about forests in general whats something that forests have a lot of i dont want to spoil it so if you want go look at the picture now and come on back if you got a guess got it great well if you didnt get it spoiler alert the answer is trees now i know you might be thinking what the heck diddliy eck do trees have to do with anything professoroony its time to take another field trip to that fancy picture friend but this time since this is where you got lost lets go together you see that big red arrow pointing to that red circle ill wait you back great okay what was inside of that red circle with the big red arrow pointing to it ill let you think about it for a second take another look at the picture if you need got it great so tehgumchum what was in that circle why it was a tree another tree alright so you know what artifacts in the game are yes if not take a break and look it up were in no rush here today no siree okay now in this game there is an interface you use to alter those artifacts you keeping up if not dont worry just start at the beginning and come back to this point as many times as you need now to use these interfaces you have to go to your classs order hall and find the interface and click on it and then you can tinker with your artifact so what does finding an interface have to do with trees trees and more trees this is where it gets interesting take a seat back for a moment maybe drink some coffee and prepare your brain heck maybe even get a nap you might be exhausted after all of this information alright back from the nap great so what does blizzard logic trees trees and more trees and tinkering with an artifact all have in common now i dont want to just say it out right this is a big moment for you tehgumchum if possible i would like you to get this yourself first so im gonna help nudge your brain along just a little before the big reveal are you familiar with the phrase its like finding a needle in a haystack well what if a gaming company i wont name any names here youll figure it out i know you will i believe tehgumchum though it was a good idea to take that concept but rather than finding a needle in a haystack instead they chose to have their players find one tree in ahow did i word it fucking forest and if you still dont get it let me know i will spell it out more plainly good luck tehgumchum
wow,removed,go drown in a river
wow,removed,for a second i thought this was that two chromosomes subreddit that annoys me before i log in what the hell man just call names back thats how the world communicates now youve seen the elections dont turn into a
wow,removed,anduin is the arthass son anduin is the arthass son anduin is the arthass son anduin is the arthass son anduin is the arthass son anduin is the arthass son
wow,removed,what is the point of this are you trying to name and shame hansol or the boosting service pretty much every top pvp player gives out boosting services so that they have a little extra income im not saying its the right thing to do and i know its against the rules however if i were above rated i would probably do the exact same i personally dont find this a constructive post at all and its pretty much a flame against hansol you couldve just made a post about blazing boost instead of just one person eventho almost every player at blizzcon at the moment promotes it on their stream
wow,removed,kill yourself fgt jump off a cliff become paralyzed whilst having herpes and down syndrome and having to survive and no way to die godbless fgt gl
wow,removed,ya the retard combo cant be done anymore thank god
wow,removed,this is about hansol isnt it
wow,removed,if you cant handle shit talk over the internet then i think you are the pathetic one it doesnt make sense to me how someones mood can be ruined by some random person calling you a name over a fantasy game on the internet if youre having a bad week unless youre just insecure as fuck its not going to be because you were called a retard by someone in your world of warcraft dungeon if anything these are the kind of threads that inspire people to talk shit to others in video games the kind of people that say people who talk shit are just insecure are the same kind of people who join up for a raid group with a terrible grasp on the dps rotation for their class and no understanding of the mechanics a raid boss requires if you sign up for a group in any sort of scenario video game or not you make a commitment to the group if you sign up for a raid boss then die to mechanics times in a row while consistently pulling low dps dont expect to be treated like a fucking child by doing things like this youre wasting other peoples time due to your lack of effort in terms of learning the encounter because there is obviously no way of implementing something to punish people for a lack of effort in a video game people will obviously feel the need to try and punish you themselves and by all means if you waste another persons minutes due to your laziness expect to be called a dipshit
wow,removed,i bought a rbg carry not to long ago just so i could get a mount and the website i went through bent over backwards for me and even threw a bunch of discounts at me after i accidentally found them in trade chat i thought it was a bored experienced pvper selling carrys for cash turned out to be lvl china spammer so i have a hard time believing they would tell you to fuck off in a live chat unless you where poking and prodding them disclaimer i understand that services like this can really disrupt pvp and the game in general but i didnt really care because i wanted a mount and the method of which i was carried got me literally nothing other than some honor and the saddle
wow,removed,do you think people should be punished for going afk in a league of legends match
wow,removed,but its the same logic no
wow,removed,autism not even once
wow,removed,reporting someone for not putting in any effort after signing up for your group and getting a depleted key at level basically fucks you for the entire reset if youre low item level and a spriest
wow,removed,why sign up for a timed run such as a mythic keystone if its your first time doesnt that seem like an irresponsible thing to do i dont think it would be possible for something such as a bad run to cause you to lose aggro multiple times thats something only caused by not knowing how to play the game once you learn it its pretty hard to fuck it up
wow,removed,i chose to play with him theres no way for me to know if they understand something as basic as aggro i have to assume that anyone that signs up for a mythic keystone would know the very basics of the game is that unreasonable anyway does that mean if it was a heroic that was found through lfg it would be acceptable to report him if anything its more the other way around
wow,removed,are you implying its possible for someone to both be trying and not know any mechanics to a dungeon and the basics of his class before signing up to a group
wow,removed,no ones equating afking to bad performance id appreciate it if you stopped straw manning its pretty obvious that im equating afking to not putting in any effort
wow,removed,if he fucks up mechanics on multiple bosses its fairly easy to say that hes not putting in any effort watching a guide on youtube or even reading the in game dungeon journal would be enough but he couldnt even be bothered doing that if you dont think that messing up mechanics on dungeon bosses consistently or losing aggro is a sure sign of lack of effort then you must suck at wow or have never played it yourself
wow,removed,nope im definitely not conflating anything if someone fucks up my run due to not knowing what to do with the light on the last boss of vault of wardens i think its fair to say its entirely his effort not his skill that fucked the run
wow,removed,i mean the priest was slightly abrasive but jesus thats about as kindly as ive ever been yelled at it gets a whole hell of a lot worse than that and it seems that this subreddit believes that the priest went off on a tirade at the tank instead of one fucking sentence
wow,removed,go get an education youre stupid as fuck
wow,removed,you think that asking people if they know mechanics works what do i do if he lies about it kick him and find another tank oh wait you cant have you ever pugged in your life literally everyone says theyve got experience but of the people dont lets just think about this hes a bad player if he doesnt understand how aggro works he shouldnt of signed up and is a dickhead he doesnt put any effort in he shouldnt have signed up and is a dickhead
wow,removed,cant argue with someone who is a fucking retard and doesnt understand how morale consistency works in any way shape or form
wow,removed,read the edit dipshit
wow,removed,i try to min max but its fucking impossible when i have to pay every time i want to change my fucking talents i think not being able to change talents is a bigger problem than not having reforging
wow,removed,ah just noticed the server goldrinn is a br server let this be a lesson to anyone who thinks its a good idea to invite brazillians to your group
wow,removed,goldrinn is a br server so that explains it
wow,removed,yeah im normal and heroic dps have pretty much zero responsibility a stun or interrupt might help you get through faster but most of that is negated with everyones ilvl by now in mythic though aoe stuns and silences can be crucial as well as focusing down certain mobs or making sure they all die at the same relative time
wow,removed,goldrinn is a br server
wow,removed,i would have left when they invited someone from a br server to the group
wow,removed,no i cant afford to min max anymore which is where my point comes in
wow,removed,qq more
wow,removed,the tears are strong
wow,removed,i think its time you ignorant twatwaffles who dont have any clue game design stop giving retarded suggestions
wow,removed,i ran a mythic the other day as a healer and beacuse ot was only a i didnt change my spec to be optimised for a five man grp i didnt not anticipate the tank chain pulling and the dps not avoiding easy to avoid damage suffice to say we still got three chests despite this even though only one person died they still called me a cunt and the worse healer eu people are arse sometime
wow,removed,i play on emerieseu its a horde server and play alliance i used serverhop as soon as i enter a wq area and it takes seconds max to put me in a group that changes my server to an alliance friendly one i know server hopping does not work the same as it used to but i have been doing this successfully since the launch of legion when im doing emissary wqs most of the population are also doing the same emissary wqs so it takes no time at all for serverhop to find a group with the leader in the current emissary area
wow,removed,so what youre saying is it wasnt just some quick offhand off the top of his head comment he literally went into a translation app just to insult the tank and you want to defend that hey calling someone an asshole or a baddie online it happens ive done it before but i usually type it out think a second and realize you know thats a really dick thing to do its not going to make me feel better and its not going to improve the situation for me my emotions are controlling how im behaving and its not going to help the situation at which point i delete what i typed so if he was using a translation app he thought yeah im gonna be a dick fuck this tank guy not once but twice both the priest and tank are fuckwits id be pissed at the tank for leaving but i understand why he did it just like id be pissed at the priest for opening his big stupid mouth even though i understand why he did it this wasnt one person being a dick its two people screwing over the other three
wow,removed,butarent you working towards legendaries with each boss kill or chest opening
wow,removed,can you explain the satisfaction of chasing a healer halfway across the map unable to kill it just to get killed by the random other players that pass by is it like some sort of autistic tunnel vision or what like i just zoned back from the dungeon i was running still heal spec and you want to kill me cool whatever get it over with i dont really want to spend minutes slowly whittling down your health but if you cant just give the fuck up already usually ill just lay down and die or fight back as heals but sometime i just continue headin where i need to go and the persistence of these autists truly baffles me
wow,removed,omg haha because of the way your comment overflowed from one line to the next fucking hot garbage was the very first thing on the next line and laughed my assignment off as a result
wow,removed,well the old way of reforging was to pick the stat and scale how you wanted it so the way i suggested is a totally different way gtfo troll
wow,removed,when theyre wasting your time and they cant be a decent person to you in the first place sure
wow,removed,you determine a persons mental problem by observing and diagnosing their actions and reactions you see someone scared the world is out to get them and talking to themselves it might be a good assumption they are untreated schizophrenic just as you see someone repeating a simple repetitive task without a variable outcome that most people wouldnt bother with or move on to better things and you can come to a conclusion they may be autistic there isnt many other ways to diagnose these disorders we use the information that is given
wow,removed,brazilians
wow,removed,wow justfuckingwow
wow,removed,hence why i used words such as assumptions and conclusion it is a personal observation i made myself and my own opinion i no way implied i am giving an official diagnosis based on how some autistic kid plays a video game
wow,removed,hey guess what youre wrong regardless of when they were released en and nh are the same raid tier stop looking at ilvl like a pleb thanks
wow,removed,i can handle people ranting people cry like little babies because they got yelled at over the internet and i find it ridiculous it is a game on the internet get over yourself move on toughen up
wow,removed,insulting people is not the behavior of a sociopath insulting someone in the game should only make the player to aspire to be better not cry in the corner with their blanky pleading for pity karma
wow,removed,no i dont see the irony all i see are weak players being upvoted for having terrible self confidence haha
wow,removed,woo what a zinger hahaha maybe there should be safe spaces in each major city
wow,removed,blizzard will ban you if you do this is a crowded area with other size increasing things they stack
wow,removed,thonkang
wow,removed,
wow,removed,you people my god
wow,removed,wow everyone really is stupid offended by everything these days remove the stickdick whatever from your ass and laugh at something once in a while

wow,removed,persons on euyes thats how you find stuff out mate
wow,removed,female pandaren look like fat tumblrinas cosplaying as fantasy characters mop was without a doubt the worst design decision ever for us audiences
wow,removed,i am glad your cuck of a king died now you got a whimpy child and a mutt in his place that is karma for defaming the horde i hope alliance serves operation meatshield when we go to argus spit triggered
wow,removed,hah why am i not surprised more pathetic theory cucks crying this kid is crying about me messaging their members which i find comical i took a few month break from wow prior to legion launching since wod was such shit when i came back they were bragging about supposedly stealing my members and one of their officers was messaging all my people talking shit and still attempting to steal i simply returned the favor and am obviously much better at stealing members than they are so here they are crying after their gm an officer and most of their raid team all left after they left i offered other people in the guild a spot since the guild was an utter joke prior to losing their only good people and afterwards i wouldnt even call it a guild they are still pathetic and cant even full clear heroic en and their pvp n such is nonexistent
wow,removed,theyre retards
wow,removed,the cucks are out en masse this evening
wow,removed,i spent over hours grinding for a legendary and got a shitty one which is utterly useless for me in raids today in en normal guild alt run this dead last dps gets back to back bis fire mage legendary fuck that i swear if i dont get a bis this week im gonna just cash in on my account and dip out i dont need this bis legendary make too much difference blizzard really dropped the ball
wow,removed,
wow,removed,never thought i would see the day when the wow skate trend caught on
wow,removed,rmelaniatrumpnude
wow,removed,tmorph version typing spell will remove the bubble and instead cast healing touch every time you activate it giving you an audible notification that your shield has been refreshed without showing the bubble typing spell will replace it with the learn grilled saberfish spell which doesnt play an animation or sound and doesnt have a bubble
wow,removed,especially when half the time its all like hurr durr just like cher up man thatl help u fucking retards i swear
wow,removed,
wow,removed,are those the eyes of hitlery cunton

wow,removed,you seem to be upset on the internet sorry bud hope it works out dont forget the drugs will always be there on the hard days where it seems like the world is against you
wow,removed,horde or alliance us or eu
wow,removed,im still looking for the tip though
wow,removed,id be down resto druid my m group had been mia for a while
wow,removed,huh literally the dumbest complaint ive ever seen did you not know you can use the tokens on any spec did you accidentally click of them while in the wrong spec the only time you cant choose which spec to put ap into is the earth elemental world bonus things that grant you ap to your currently equipped weapon but they only give like anyways and i dont even think they scale
wow,removed,you mean donald
wow,removed,kys
wow,removed,how can you not understand that it is difficult for some players if lfr is too difficult for you you have no business doing max levelend game large group content go back to normal dungeons and learn your fucking class and how not to die to simple shit maybe we need to bring back man intermediary raids like ubrs so people can learn the basics of raiding without wasting quite as many peoples time
wow,removed,this just in i can continue it aswell
wow,removed,well then youre just an idiot thats not something blizzard can rectify
wow,removed,id love it
wow,removed,forgot to mention us account
wow,removed,this is against terms and conditiona of blizzard and breaking subredit
wow,removed,gone delete topic
wow,removed,because trashpickers can get the fuck out
wow,removed,chest not big enough start stuffin
wow,removed,allahu akbar lets go fuck little boys and bomb our own people
wow,removed,so before i get the lol you dont need one comment if you are pushing high end content imo you have a responsibility to your group to do all you can to make the content that much easier never go full retard youre turning a game thats meant to be played for fun into a job and your logic is fuck all retarded its like youre taking winning the lottery into account when you sit down to do your bills its just fucking stupid and not feasible
wow,removed,but you see if i were to understand your retarded logic that would make me retarded as well just stop being retarded man is it really that hard god damn
wow,removed,hes more of a horde guy he wore that sweatshirt once at a blizzcon
wow,removed,i didnt want to see this
wow,removed,baddie
wow,removed,and thats why it has to be four man unanimouslyyes that way atleast one saint person can prevent this bullshit to happen it takes one asshole and two idiots right now to make that decision
wow,removed,it takes atleast people to be in total control of the kickvote system there is always that one mindless idiot its the same bullshit and duos usually dont wanna fuck up their own instance especially because it hurts themself its not a problem that two people kick another person just because they dont like him
wow,removed,no i dont having four man votekick counters the one asshole case having three votekick opens the doors for the revenge piece of shit what happens more often the one asshole who couldnt care less because insta replacement or the duo assholes who both wanna fuckup their progress
wow,removed,wow what an asshole
wow,removed,
wow,removed,to i package poppoppp o p op pic opened in ppm i p i o pi po opioid o im just pop o pop pp op w o
wow,removed,i never said i made an argument so looking at your post history suggests that you are a retard something i suspected from the start so i think well leave it here okay youre saying that as if bombing sandniggers is something negative
wow,removed,hey retard the the current system one player is in control if the entire kick system
wow,removed,you can kick player in a man vote system
wow,removed,you are so full of shit and you are in line with kick trolls dont you realize that you are wrong
wow,removed,yes its the case in a vast majority of random groups hey retard it takes one asshole to control the system how are the odds that there is one personasshole in a group
wow,removed,every profession besides enchanting has to be looked at either nerf or buff every other profession
wow,removed,dae got amirite
wow,removed,
wow,removed,elemental my dear sherlock so then they can start whining about how legion has nothing to do in less than month
wow,removed,how is it elitism to not want to play with inbreeds like you
wow,removed,all the people that got suspended for exploting basilisks got their accounts back with their inventories untouched
wow,removed,xd
wow,removed,i am so fucking jealoud
wow,removed,well there only current game by riot is league of legends which is lacking in most departments gameplay subjective i guess character design art and graphics again probably subjective lol like most mobas or assfaggots or whatever is unsurprisingly narrow and just not as deep or as broad as blizzs collection of games
wow,removed,you just blew my mind like a mass shooter at a university
wow,removed,because it was me
wow,removed,at least you have a legendary i still do not have one on any of my three
wow,removed,no not top all you had to do was google search this goes to show monks are retards

wow,removed,really i think uh has a great artifact frost on the other hand
wow,removed,ahhh i see
wow,removed,beats me
wow,removed,not on the danish keyboard
wow,removed,whos the pink haired sjw on stage
wow,removed,why report it use it u fgt
wow,removed,the prize was this httpsmyoutubecomwatchvosdandcyypi
wow,removed,so instead of being patient they act like kids expect legacy servers to take priority over current content and slap blizzard in the face when they dont get their way incredible blizzard has somewhat turned a blind eye to private servers going to laugh when they pull out the hammer and just end every private server they see bunch of dropkicks
wow,removed,literally who cares about these crybabies they are a very small minority of players whose interest doesnt mean anything to blizzard or the future of the game let them do what they want they dont get to win though they can fantasize about millions of players leaving wow for a ms private server but that will never be a reality they will be forgotten about in a week like they were after they were shut down
wow,removed,niggа its pve you can man that shit
wow,removed,read the damn post before you start mindlessly shilling against it
wow,removed,i dont care to start any arguments you can play what you want its completely other thing to be delusional and say that mess that was vanilla is just as good as legion
wow,removed,well so they are acting like spoilt children because they cant have what they want when they want it the fact that blizzard have talked about doing something is something and they are going to talk about it when they are ready to talk about it is also something i feel what they are doing isnt going to help anyone releasing source code what will that achieve really blizzard is a big company but it takes time to do something like this they thought that they would get an announcement within a matter of months please time to get realistic i think something will come from blizzard eventually and i used to be against them doing anything but they have been more open about the whole topic this whole thing is just going to hurt their crusade
wow,removed,dead as fuck and blizz doesnt give a shit shocker
wow,removed,and im saying that most of those people seriously came from outside of this sub yes it was a massive thing but most of the huge support that you saw here for it was from people who just came here because of it theres a reason there was a big faction of people basically telling all the legacy people to fuck off within a week because most of the posts about legacy were people who hated current wow and basically took over a sub about current wow that has always had anti private server rules it was damn annoying how every single post was about legacy in a sub that it shouldnt have been in in the first place
wow,removed,nost we want legacy servers blizzard no nost its been months and weve been ignored by blizzard bloody hell i cant wait til all of this is over
wow,removed,cool maybe the legacy server movement will die with this if you want to play old wow because you think its the best shit ever thats fine but expecting blizzard to cater to a much smaller audience is dumb wow isnt what it used to be and thats good if you dont like wow in its current state dont play it there are other games
wow,removed,offer technical advice a private server team offering technical advice to blizzard ha
wow,removed,yeah what they are doing now is vengeful and immature
wow,removed,the fact that accessing their website at all has an antiddos delay screams persecution complex
wow,removed,this fanboy mentality they quieted them to calm the storm for legions launch
wow,removed,you scumfucks should be thankful that i actually post on this subreddit
wow,removed,im sure rwow will have a thought provoking and intelligent conversation about legacy servers for sure this time no way theres going to be a huge circlejerk about how legacy and private servers are the antichrist
wow,removed,you people who are trying to drag the game down are irrelevant
wow,removed,
wow,removed,why are the wow was better when it was physically painful to play hipsters always so edgy
wow,removed,prepare to get downvoted by the legacy players because youre making them look bad
wow,removed,a casters weapon is like a niggеrs gun though you cant take that shit away
wow,removed,so basically theyre a bunch of crybabies that didnt get what they want so theyre gonna go ahead and break the law again yeah real sensible and mature
wow,removed,tldr they didnt get what they want so theyre breaking the law again and being crybabies
wow,removed,amazing well thought out incredibly knowledgeable post
wow,removed,what you say is true to a degree in terms of content drought pushed more people to vanilla servers but that doesnt change the fact that there is a sizable amount of people who still want to play vanilla better yet currently subscribed players also would like the option to play vanilla why are all antilegacy people so shortsighted i keep hearing this imaginary notion that prolegacy people are the bad ones when everytime a thread like this pops up you have hundreds of people attacking anyone who thinks vanilla was a good game in its own right sure it would take some dev time but it would be worth it not just because i would like to play it but because the vanilla experience to me is an experience any gamer should have the access to experience they shouldnt have to go the illegal route making legacy servers would solve problems not one first you curb the private server people second it provides a game that is considered one of the most influential games in history a platform in which it can still be legally played today and third it provides current wow subscribers with an option to experience raidsdungeons that are mostly goneredone as a way to experience content between patches most of my guild are basically done with everything they want to do atm the only thing we have left is mythic and we simply cant because we dont have the peopledo not want to invest into mythic
wow,removed,lol if you say so
wow,removed,why does it matter its a rough estimate even if it were million his point stands
wow,removed,i would very much like to see nostalrius gone and i hope this is the first step towards that they can pretend to be so professional and caring about their community yet they are the main reason that i and im sure many other people are so against legacy servers in the first place blizzard is a company and they had a very busy they released a new hs adventure many new hots heroes overwatch the wow movie and one of their most successful wow expansions to this date and we had blizzcon as well and who knows what they are working on behind the scenes even if they have the intention to release legacy servers they couldnt do so within the time frame that nostalrius and many people demands them to do so they can threaten blizzard all they want its not gonna make them create legacy servers any faster or help in any sort of way the matter of fact is the only reason why we are having a conversation like this about legacy servers is because of wod the outcry for legacy servers wouldnt have been as loud as it was if nostalrius wasnt shut down during the content drought of of wod where many players very extremely dissatisfied with wow and no doubt why many even tried nostalrius or other vanilla realms for example does anyone here really thinks that so many people would have given it the time of day if it have happened during legion personally i dont think so i been to subreddits where many vanilla fans often hang out and had nice discussions about the topic and didnt even get down voted into oblivion which is nice nostalrius and mark kern and a lot of advocates downplay how much work it takes for blizzard to create these legacy realms i mean if nostalrius did it why cant they right it creates a lot of animosity towards blizzard and against people who object to the idea of having legacy servers or at least why it isnt as simple as some people make it out to be there are a lot of questions and problems that needs to be solved by blizzard before they make legacy servers and we have to keep that in mind will there be balance patches content updates are they gonna roll into other expansions will the character get transferredcopied to another expansion realm or vanilla rolls into bc and so on wouldnt any changes to vanilla inherently go against the idea of legacy realms its really not that simple and the more discussions i have people who want legacy realms they see that too
wow,removed,itll only be there for a year or two for each person its not this long lasting want like people seem to think player burn out happens and new content is required to compete with the burnout its not a sustainable thing for blizzard to do cause like i said itll just be dead in a few years or people will beg for updates to fucking vanilla which already happened and is happening
wow,removed,oh because private servers outweigh wow subs
wow,removed,people are playing the newest ones they can get their hands on without paying for it the playerbase from cataclysm to wod private servers is so small that blizzard wouldnt even notice if they didnt pay the sub fee on the live game youre stupid if you think it has more to do with it being free to play compared to people enjoying the old versions of the game wotlk has several functional and stable private servers that arent even close to the population that nostalrius had
wow,removed,having read the whole announcement i can readily surmise these guys are a bunch of rank amateurs legacy servers are nonsensical which version of the game will you deploy to people on the first place what about hosting fees whats the server infrastructure you will builddeploy on to make the experience seamless who cares if nost put together a whole action plans and deliverables its someone elses ip and they own the rights point blank the largest issue is a segmentation of the user base for all the complainers out there realize that wow is the ip of a publicly listed company the fact that they havent sued the pants off nost whomever they are is indicative that blizzard respects community to hear them out and make time for them also keep in mind that legion went live in the past months that these individuals caught feelings and didnt hear back anyone who knows anything about software development realizes the last few months are crunch time and extremely stressful maybe nost should have engaged them later factually the fact is blizzard doesnt have a firm plan for legacy servers is a good thing they are devoting all resources to growing the core game and making it better the day may come when everyone abandons wow altogether and this is likely when they will entertain the issue also it doesnt matter how many people are willing to pay for legacy servers these numbers pale in comparison to the millions all in all i applaud blizzard for de facto relaunching the game this year similar to diablo and making it accessible once again
wow,removed,suck a dick retail
wow,removed,other servers that are out of firing distance from blizzards legal cannon like on the other hand im so glad k didnt get the source code from what i remember theyre a bunch of cash whores
wow,removed,yes of course they just choose to not take millions of dollars that hardly requires any work pff what kind of dummies are they
wow,removed,ah so now its a security issue you guys are crawling down rabbit holes to hide from the fact that blizzard dropped the ball on this one
wow,removed,youre saying the server is being hosted in a country that isnt bound by the intellectual property agreements laid out by the world trade organization well unless its being hosted in north korea or south sudan you can fuck off spreading this ignorant crap about how the us cant enforce intellectual property law in other countries
wow,removed,hhahahahahahahahaha what a fucking joke gg
wow,removed,thats literally not true did it happen with any other video game did it happen to when microsoft abandoned it and the ip was stolen for years
wow,removed,because circlejerk thats why also if you like nolstarius or whatever other private servers you play you arent going to want to believe that blizzard would shut it down im surprised very hot wow private server is still up and running they even sell ingame mounts for actual money not going to say the actual server name because of the rules but
wow,removed,the problem was that after that there was zero communication and they were just ignored start by reading the article
wow,removed,bull shit you obviously never touched nost why bother making up lies
wow,removed,yay cant wait to play nostalrius elysium again
wow,removed,theyve tried to appeal to a business and failed heres where i disagree with you they didnt fail its only been months if weve learned anything blizzard moves at a monumentally slow pace as they have everything planned well in advance just because they hadnt heard anything recently doesnt mean that theyd never hear anything nor does it mean that blizzard wasnt actively making plans in regards to legacy servers no this is nostralius throwing a teenagers temper tantrum because they got tired of waiting the truly unfortunate thing is this is going to be in the back of the mind of blizzard anytime they reach out to a community like this and a pretty big reason for them to stay away
wow,removed,false information you really dont have a fucking clue about intellectual property laws then you have the audacity to tell people not to spread false information why the fuck are you even making a comment
wow,removed,you mean exactly like vanilla wow wooo molten core fire elemental boss woo brd more fire elementals and some dwarves better grind that shiz out to gear different people and hope they all sign on next week well be killing a rock elemental woo but muh guild relashionchips and server community only if you were on a decently populated server low populated server guess you arent raiding just because you do the same world quests guess what other people are doing them too you see more people out in the world now the community is still there not our problem people are too lazy to look
wow,removed,what problem exactly piracy of their own code how entitled you are
wow,removed,what what an absolute trash mongoloid im glad they got cut out now
wow,removed,thses people are delusional and think that legion isnt hemmoraging subs id be surprised if its above mill irght now if they released classic servers it would easily bring them back to at least million they are just fucking idiots and dont wanna
wow,removed,hahaha right on fuck you blizzard hope your company fucking burns
wow,removed,if vanilla dungeons take you hours then youre a shitter and probably shouldnt be playing mmos
wow,removed,hah getting downvoted because you made the fanboys angry by stating the truth
wow,removed,bullshit this interpretation of the law is beyond retarded nostalrius wrote edited and hosted open sourced emulation it would be identical to suing the guys that made the console emulators back in the day which nintendo did and lost
wow,removed,theyre a bunch of babies even without taking sides all they do is demand things they are in no position to demand despite our thousands of signatures hell its nice of blizzard to even have a meeting with them and their thanks lmao heres the source code wewillneverdie it was honestly a bit convincing even for someone who doesnt want legacy servers but now theyve just thrown any ounce of professionalism out the window its hilarious to see all these twitch streamers suddenly not give a shit about legacy servers cus theyre enjoying legion or claim mental instability like kungen
wow,removed,i hope this ppl go to jail
wow,removed,egotripping babies they named themselves ambassadors of legacy wow and then go on to sell tshirts and now ruin it for any other private server to flourish by doing this good job lads as idiotic as their followers
wow,removed,at no point after the meeting did blizzard ignore nostalrius they chose to not respond to further communication thats the definition of ignoring someone the fact that they even met with them in the first place absolves blizzard of any claim that they ignored the group this is complete bullshit theres no rule in the world that says you cant ignore someone after youve talked to them once blizzard invited nostalrius over so blizzard has some social obligations to end the dialogue if they dont need nosts help anymore doing otherwise is stringing someone along which is considered rude behavior by most decent people
wow,removed,illidan kills guldan at the end of the nighthold so guldan will have already been stopped prior to argus
wow,removed,this is fucking stupid advice the cops could very likely come and kill them never call the cops on someone who is in an emotional position cops are trained to shoot first ask questions later
wow,removed,if the cops hurt the person the blood is on your hands
wow,removed,lol the only thing funnier then this is the comments i just want vanilla without the bugs then it wouldnt be vanilla wow because it was full of bugs lol i really like legacy but i wish they would release more content again lol how long until youre back to cata i still dont understand this obsession with legacy servers since from what ive seen over the years is every single person has a diffrent idea of what good wow is or just want to play it for a day or two to expereince the expansions they missed
wow,removed,pros pretty fun lots to do fun challenging content cons rng is at all time cancerous heights with new content being focused around players having them if you are unlucky enough to not get any or any useful ones youre going to be shit out of luck gear upgrades only come in the form of rng rolls for titanwarforging with the awful statting of most gear just means that you will hit a drought around where youre more or less reliant on rng to progress its bad to the point where im probably going to cancel my sub
wow,removed,well me must remember that we only has one side of the story whose fault is that
wow,removed,its totally valid if vanilla wow came out today itd crash and burn
wow,removed,i think youre under the impression that blizz is being threatened from where im sitting its looking like blizz doesnt give two shits from their silence over the last few months so nost is releasing their mangos branch for the benefit of the emulation community
wow,removed,to complain on the internet oh dear we have to prevent that at any cost grow up
wow,removed,correct the server shut down voluntarily after the cd most private servers ignore these letters and nothing comes of it valkyrie in particular has been running for about years nostalrius shut themselves down in hope that there could be an official solution
wow,removed,super guild invite
wow,removed,if i dont like something then enjoying it must be wrong and i need to tell people why it is wrong
wow,removed,if you want something above utter trashtier writing youre in the wrong game hell youre not even at the right company
wow,removed,he had a reason it was just an illegitimate one apparently people want some realbattle experience on their new classes when theyre about to change heavily or something
wow,removed,you saw that in the brazilian official forums didnt you according to your post story you are from brazil too oh sweet sweet karma

wow,removed,ive been to hillsbrad foothills ok on our tour to sack the undercity we came across a small orc village nestled southwest of brill a few klicks off the beaten path most of their men perished in siege of the fucker and it left a bunch of homes with mostly women and children our spirits were high this weird thing that accompanies adrenaline and victory i went into one of the huts there was a solitary orc girl about years old by measure we made eye contact it was a weird interaction filled with high emotion i went over to her never breaking eye contact i took her shoulders in my hands and forced her shift up she protested but i brushed her aside and pretty much stroked her until wet i fucked her whist looking into her eyes initially it was fear but it changed to supplication and then to pleasure i didnt fall in love that day i made contact with some orcs soul that ive never been able to reestablish those were interesting days playing vanilla
wow,removed,meanwhile everyone is getting hyped for the nostalrius rerelease in weeks thanks for the shitpost lel
wow,removed,were all going to be playing it again in weeks anyway
wow,removed,what the fuck are you talking about no one needs official servers blizzard doesnt give a crap anyways there is a reason they dont announce subnumbers anymore retail wow just sucks and people dont want to play it anymore
wow,removed,shut your dick holster josey
wow,removed,its not they said like weeks ago they lowered the spawn so it pops about twice every months
wow,removed,if you tweeted it directly you shouldnt fucking post it here jesus you attention whore
wow,removed,yeah maybe you need to look at the game and wipe that shit from your lips look at the game then look at wowdb if this isnt everything you need then you must love the taste of shit
wow,removed,have you tried the one made for people who arent white you racist piece of shit
wow,removed,make sure you arent accidentally supporting the white one you racist piece of shit
wow,removed,im sorry are you dumb or do you just love spitting awful misinformation out of your arse corpse shield look it up it gives us incredible survivability in m paired casting with your pets protective bile ability and you or your pet isnt going to die through literally anything damage reduction to you and that damage goes to your pet which then takes less damage it essentially gives you a hp shield unholy survivability frost frost does way more dps in m in large aoe pulls sure however getting to higher mythic where you arent doing massive pulls and are in small size group pulls unholy has an advantage if you play unholy correctly and prep targets also single target unholy still reigns champion for me doesnt have a pet or diseases that luke to pull random shit first of all unholys pet cant body pull anything full stop it will literally run through mobs and not pull a single thing if set on assist guess what frost has diseases too howling blasts aoe spread is yards where as unholys outbreak is a single target disease that spreads to nearby enemies ive never accidentally pulled anything with outbreak please next time jsut shut the fuck up if you have nothing critical to say at all frost does have a stun correct
wow,removed,talking about mythic plus dps links en parses and specifically ursoc damage a fight with cleave yeah shut the fuck up buddy still never pulled anything with outbreak as im not a retard and i know how to control my aoe this is what youre looking for kid in regards to mythic plus damage
wow,removed,they were you were too late now wait for next wq reset acting like a cunt helps nothing and nobody
wow,removed,right because youre obviously so successful in the real world do yourself a favor and drink bleach btw ive been paid £ this month alone while studying at university mastering audio tracks goodluck seeing how many times you can masturbate in a day kid
wow,removed,this is fine and good and all that and i know some people have different degrees of autismaspergers etc but if youre the type of player who disables chat and then continues to run dungeons you are the worst and im going to assume youre either russian years old an asshole who doesnt care i feel like if someone does this because of social anxiety that is not the reaction they are going for the opposite probably so for the love of god people just read the god damn chat and please answer if someone asks you to do something please
wow,removed,look im not trying to say unholy has better numbers than frost im not a fucking retard im talking about a kid spewing misinformation about your pet pulling mobs pulling as if outbreak is barrage its literally not even close something like a yard range spread between enemies play a dk and try it out unholy works best for me as im rocking two pretty good unholy legendaries i have knowledge of the spec and know how to play it well i have parses in en without the bracers im not as ignorant as i make myself out to be just when responding to people who spout misinformation l get heated and treat them like shit as they have clearly done to me and others misinformation helps nobody
wow,removed,yeah i understand where youre coming from and honestly i dont mind about my shit getting buried at the end of the day you see no real analysis on this subreddit its a cesspool if youre not apart of the hivemind you get buried the amount of people telling me unholy is broken unviable or whatever is fucking ridiculous i still occasionally top the meters of our mythic kills and runs so im honestly not fussed
wow,removed,drink bleach please thanks
wow,removed,im sorry you are incapable of clicking the different keystone levels and checking for yourself httpeubattlenetwowencharacterravencrestlicariussimple there you go
wow,removed,false information such as how unholy pets dont pull aggro outbreak doesnt pull like barrage and how unholy is useless drink bleach pls ty i f you want to talk shit atleast link your shit char progress

wow,removed,maga
wow,removed,because half of america just lost their country and the other half realized you will be rewarded for being an asshole to everyone everyone is scared or belligerent and acting out
wow,removed,you think you can wear square inch of cloth in total and not be subject to slut shaming where the f do you think you are a lac female studies campus
wow,removed,you may want to add cuck to that list
wow,removed,hm two strangers and youre a demon hunter youre probably shit

wow,removed,nice edit garbage player
wow,removed,are you also be unaware of a couple of horse cocks imbedded in your rear end or are you just used to it
wow,removed,you stupid fuck there is protection if you play with people you know personally
wow,removed,cheating is kind of part of russian culture in competition
wow,removed,anybody got a free copy of legion
wow,removed,if anybody can give this poor man a cd key of legion na i can die a happy man
wow,removed,if that is your attitude maybe you should not wake up tomorrow morning
wow,removed,hey im dark short hair eclectic taste in music m no beard no superpowers love the nerdy things in life only have tattoos one awesome the other a disappointment typically a shy guy but thought i would reply as you wrote beautifully nice rgonewild posts
wow,removed,cool no boostright i guess they pulled it off
wow,removed,rofl are you actually this delusional the majority likes lfr lol how fucking delusional can you be the majority of the playerbase unsubbed because the game is shit right now go look at some charts of subs before and after lfr and then tell me how the vast majority of players love lfr in icc only like of people had ever downed marrowgar while it was current which was why they added lfr so why do youblizz want to force nonraiders to raid they dont need to see that content they had other things to do the first wing of icc was so easy and accessible anyone could do it if they wanted guess what they didnt because the majority of wow players never wanted to raid in the first place
wow,removed,its pretty weird to play it as a single player game you know server communities were hurt a lot because people did not need to group for leveling anymore and they are just doing it in single player mode you cant make server communities without people in it how fucking dumb are you i like smaller servers because they have more of a community than high pop servers do i never said i was going to play alone but crz give me zero benefits of playing on a high pop servers and all the downsides why would anyone defend crz its not good for anyone with one mega server there definitely wouldnt be any sense of community at all if you think otherwise you are beyond retarded and delusional no fucking shit the dumbing down of questing hurt server communities i never argued for a singleplayer game i want the opposite but crz does not help anyone unfortunately you are beyond retarded with less than iq so dont waste your time trying to think its not for you
wow,removed,it is on kelthuzad and the name is milbhean lvl dwarf hunter so i can go to buy the looms in iron forge
wow,removed,i explicitly mentioned the example with i know by logical deduction that it can not be reasonable to assume this is the intended way for quests to work but it does if i said i have never exploited anything in wow i would be flat out lying because the way the game is made there are numerous errors that appear over the timespan of years have i benefited from some of those bugs before sure i have but for the matter at hand i have zero knowledge about why im getting banned because i have never wintraded yet this is why i am getting banned so now im inclined to believe have i been part of some group of people who have inadvertently wintraded well i have been in rbg groups where we only met a single player who did nothing but it was never our plan to set out to battle teams like this i have not intentionally done that but it has happened because i have played the game so much that stuff like this is bound to happen i did not know beforehand that i would encounter situations like this i did not intend for them to arrise but they did now what the fuck do i do i met or empty rbg teams does that put my account into auto delete mode does that seem fair
wow,removed,let me try
wow,removed,im not here to prove to you that i am innocent im just looking for someone from blizzard i can get in touch with to have them actually properly investigate my account i didnt come here looking for some manchild like yourself who are blatantly ignorant towards other people and unvebitably just started plastering insults everywhere because your simple mind is such a limiting factor for you that you probably have nothing else to entertain yourself with oh and btw jon snow dies in the next season on tv
wow,removed,i suspect you should look for helptreatment for whatever you are suffering from
wow,removed,ha gayyyyyyyyyyyyy
wow,removed,dude who cares you just freely share information
wow,removed,nice then thats good one less entitled shitter who doesnt play games unless they jerk him off
wow,removed,the reason this was downvoted is because you are stupid not to call you retarded but simply stupid you had it on personal when you should had well known personal only gives you items on every boss are you a legion baby prehaps never played wow before
wow,removed,stop bending your sister over your desk when youre playing
wow,removed,doing looking for retards for runes northing else my motivation for the game going down evry time im in a lfr so many there dont know how to play the game and now lfr going to give all the newbs tier gear is so facepalm whats the point on being an raider to get tier gear when evre god damn newb can get it now lfr should only give rare items maybe rare set like vanilla tbc doungen sets nothing more then that
wow,removed,medivh has been binge eating it looks like
wow,removed,the people who say your dps sucks dont usually think theyre being rude only honest so in a similar vein the contrast needs to be pointed out
wow,removed,holy cringe
wow,removed,sieg heil
wow,removed,retard roasted
wow,removed,first i saw it to be honest i always showed me regardless
wow,removed,went
wow,removed,wrong
wow,removed,here
wow,removed,like
wow,removed,seriously
wow,removed,well now we know why they camp you they know youre a cunt
wow,removed,with crit i see big numbers pop up more often you dont the amount of crit required for you to observe this unconditionally will be enough for verse to allow you stand in some serious shit hell even with primary stats i see a gradual increase to damage so whats the difference between that and verse verse scales a bit lower still the best of second best stat for some classes just behind primary stat but not to a huge extend by you wont see any difference from any stat increase if you dont stack it
wow,removed,where exactly is this false the data you listed demonstrate that the effect of versa scales a bit weaker than crit but it says nothing about the subject i present
wow,removed,your argument does nothing to address that versatility is just a stat that combines other stats like agi and armor you are completely correct i said nothing about versa was a great stat or not i was simply saying that your arguments are not persuasive at all its lazy as shit not as lazy as you do who ignore my arguments completely
wow,removed,not those are completely different topics the survivability provided by versa is examined by incoming damage the crit provided by crit is present by players outgoing damage the implication you made from my post is baseless
wow,removed,i was hoping that you werent implying that vers allows you to stand in shit and do almost the same amount of damage as you would with crit and avoiding shit please quote my words that has implication on this and no im not making arguments out of context im directly addressing your confusion that versas effect scaling a bit lower than crits means the crit increased frequency observed from every extra point of crit can be compared to survivability provided by versa and yes you are embarrasing yourself by making irrelevant post and sucking at reading comprehension
wow,removed,then listing those useless data is not the way to do so should i teach you how to argue against that argument lmao
wow,removed,did you just contract amnesia that was explained several posts ago if you are not trolling your reading ability is just laughable
wow,removed,look you are not even quoting the actual explanation but a single claim im not quoting it for you since im here teaching you how to read now try again
wow,removed,what if this makes him snap and finally get the courage up to blow his brains out do you want that blood on your hands
wow,removed,fuck you
wow,removed,i must admit im curious how you came to the conclusion that posting a picture of a random person with thunderfury equipped was a worthwhile submission
wow,removed,ilvl ends up trumping secondaries in most cases at least in the case of tanks since you obviously cant comprehend english i would suggest looking up the word most obviously jewelry is an exception because it doesnt have main stat the fact that you feel the need to point it out is why youre an idiot
wow,removed,in between the boss section
wow,removed,at least not all the people on this thread are jerkwad retards thanks for the logical answer
wow,removed,obviously damage is important for mythic say the words attack power does as much for druids from a tanking stand point because you know thats what this entire thread is about as it does for vengeance demon hunters please
wow,removed,it isnt
wow,removed,hi jake if you are viewing this please message me your blizzard emailpassword
wow,removed,they dont balance the game around duels and never will so what dueling other players outside the major cities is a pretty significant part of the game for lots of players and gives them a chance to socialize improve and have fun if players cant get decent gear for this its ruined how does world content affect pvp immensely and you can get artifact power from pvp world content is extremely difficult for players that havent been doing dungeons for gear i got shotted by a rare when i was about item level came back today with after grinding more than of people are willing to saw it was spawned and killed it easily other players that also like both aspects of the game but havent been getting decent rewards for focusing on pvp are going to have a bad experience theyll barely be able to do hcs and never in a million years get accepted in mythics and no you cant get artifact power from pvp youre a fuckin retard if you truly believe that
wow,removed,i did every single quest in first zones got to am still wrapping up high mountain you missed a ton
wow,removed,hey thanks for posting yet another one of these threads for easy upvotes bet you pulled shitter deeps too
wow,removed,i hate you
wow,removed,also that toons name is olarisa i know this caz reasons
wow,removed,lol the funniest thing is that girls always have it easy in mmos the second their guildmates or people around know they are girls
wow,removed,exactly legion will i project be an addon with a lot of repetitive tasks for twinks you need reps you need the class campaign finished which is time gated you need to level the artifact im not looking forward to ride the isles times over
wow,removed,dude i could have responded with flames stronger than those that made the metal infrastructure of mysteriously burn to air but i chose to laugh it off bud
wow,removed,razer lmao enjoy ur double clicks in
wow,removed,the raid drops baseline might as well enchant ur current gear
wow,removed,every class for the most part sorry locks seem to have their place and can hold their own fairly well dh are the flavor of the month but i havent seen an over abundance of them oh the irony of my flair like we did with dks wayyy less moves you should not require too much to customize to fit everything they slimmed the talent trees down to where you only have talent tiers to choose from there is no more hybrid specs it definitely feels like a simpler play style but the rotations are still there just the cool downs dont seem to take up buttons anymore it is completely up to you if you like your class then i would stick with it you can probably ticket a gm and they will be able to help you if you were hacked leveling has been streamlined and is a lot easier to level the lore is just a little mixed now i would not recommend using your boost you get from legion until after you feel comfortable playing but thats just like my opinion man i just downloaded it as i had built a brand new computer and if i remember correctly it does have some bulk i believe it is around but dont quote me on this utinytitn
wow,removed,nein nein nein nein
wow,removed,so is a tard interesting
wow,removed,says the guy that failed kindergarden

wow,removed,
wow,removed,
wow,removed,rofl who cares about being able to outdps a retard who cant play his class some of us are doing mythic raids and will be forced into holy because ret is in its current state and cannot compete because we do not have terrible players we can replace like your casual guild who aims to clear lfr by the time next expansion hits also if you want loh bring a holy paladin if you want bop bring a holy paladin no reason to bring a ret besides when you use loh on the tank you prevent his own loh due to forberance and his is significantly stronger than yours since it scales with your hp again youre backing yourself into a corner which shows you have no fucking clue what is going on around you and therefore you should probably be quiet when the people with a clue have a sensible discussion
wow,removed,shut up
wow,removed,just when i was doing the fucking raid i swear to god if its poodlecorp again ill hunt the cunts

wow,removed,kill yourself you are unloved
wow,removed,uh dk haste crit my opener is similar and until i fixed a lot of my secondary stats it felt off after gaining more crit my opener changed slightly instead of having to festering strike times i only have to do now and i get wounds pop dark transformation gargoyle soul reaper apocalypse then spam festering till wounds while mixing in coils then ss coil spam and repeat when dark transformation soul reaper come back usually both come around the same time for me dark transfusion now around the time for soul reaper you want to get at least wounds up and have runes for ss available i say cus odds are if you crit with ss you are only critting with half the attack and popping wounds in the process because of the innate crit being low on half the attack also keeping runes is important in case you just get unlucky and dont crit thats how i do it and usually hold on mythic single target no lust
wow,removed,well if were gonna be honest i am too nice to meet you retard
wow,removed,yeah no i think you need to take the meds dude go cry more about legendaries that wont improve how shit you are
wow,removed,oh its not a joke then its gay

wow,removed,well ddos are made by any frustrated autistic scumfk with a decent net connection they dont need reasons just a happy childhood being raped by daddy kek
wow,removed,respect i play world of warcraft knowing that i dont have an expectation of privacy no one does people stream their gameplay all the time just like i do its insane to think im going to sit there and block all the names i come across please stop being a weirdo thanks
wow,removed,you think i just ignored the text that was suppose to warn about restarts quess what ¨retard¨ there was no such text
wow,removed,people with that problem need to go and visit a doctor not play a mmo game seriously
wow,removed,so why play mmo game with tons of people around you if thats what causes problems for you
wow,removed,how can you enjoy the game that causes anxiety problems and introduces fear of encountering some random shitheads in lfg youre messed up
wow,removed,see its even worse you have to raid you have to arena or you can do world quests all day waste your money and time and talk to no people at all either way youre messed up for worsening your condition
wow,removed,aye sure i am im sorry im not messed up with some bogus anxiety
wow,removed,i dont find it useful to show empathy to people with bogus problems and anxiety that is flat out riddiculous and barely possible
wow,removed,its weird to block out pseudonyms in a publicly accessible game
wow,removed,gz youre autistic
wow,removed,this guy cucks
wow,removed,check your server on httpwwwwowprogresscom try to find a guild that suites your experience level and what level of time commitment youre able to pt in if youve never done progression raiding that probably means joining a normal mode guild that raids or nights a week once you find a guild that looks like it fits you either find their forums should be linked on wowprogress or pm an officer to find out more info some guilds will have a more lengthy application process than others things that are important when looking at accepting new players from my prospective as someone who does recruiting be honest about your experience level if you claim to have mythic experience then you better have some logs to back it up just be honest be willing to join voice chat yes its annoying that every guild and every group you play with on every game seems to have a different voip program but just do it if you join and sound like a nonasshole youre already doing yourself a major favor
wow,removed,ugly ugly retard seal form is the glorious way of the future conform
wow,removed,actually you raise a very good point i mean who were the other options return thrall ask bain to step up lets face it sylvanis is the only one with the balls to win this fight

wow,removed,if jyn had become a jedi she still would have died years before rey was in force awakens so im not sure how that would have mattered
wow,removed,fuck off you retard
wow,removed,youre actually retarded read the other comments another redditor thinking he knows shit because he finally downed heroic xavius lol
wow,removed,res has save and saveres saveres says it is local only
wow,removed,remindme years was webzagar right
wow,removed,remindme years
wow,removed,only the good ones
wow,removed,youre pretty bad at your class then outlaw is so much better than dh at single target
wow,removed,
wow,removed,but i think compared with previous expansion such as vod lich king and so on boosting in legion is much slower if i spend to hours playing the game it will take about days to reach the cap level grinding the maps is also a horse work but luckily it is dynamic levels for the maps according to players levels so can switch maps easily i think the exp gotten from quests in legion is less than others if someone needs legion boosting guide hope it can help patch return to karazhan is coming so its time to get fully preparation
wow,removed,tldr lfr is for new players normal for fresh heroic for geared and mythic becomes somewhat interesting but is still easy
wow,removed,theres still plenty of money to be made in wow and other games if you know where to look and no im not telling you where to look i havent sold anything in wow for cash since vanilla but i know of friends who still do
wow,removed,gah i feel stupid now i thought specifically about some storyline ie game of thrones
wow,removed,meme detected ops ability to express original thought or look into the nuances behind a decision has been nerfed into the ground
wow,removed,remindme year
wow,removed,says the guy whose entire comment history is him being a dick to people regardless these omg look at my mission failure posts are getting old
wow,removed,cuck
wow,removed,some games it doesnt work though at least for me the game bar always crashes my wow hopefully its just me that it does it for
wow,removed,okay cool but retards are still downvoting me like its somehow my fault that it was broken in arena i wish they would disable everything that isnt a class feature in arena nerfing other shit because its strong in arena is stupid not that it matters it just reinforces that this sub is full of complete fucking moron manchildren
wow,removed,twitchtvbylekoyd sick new wow stream awesome pvp action chill music check him out
wow,removed,twitchtvbylekoyd sick new wow stream awesome pvp action chill music check him out
wow,removed,just did a search of new for orbs since im curious what it looks like now i was in the same boat and actually ended up bribing a warlock in trade and grabbing a guildy to go through the hole and summon me through ive also heard heroic leap works i was talking to the other people camping it and someone paid for a race change to try and beat the rush
wow,removed,yeah i cant wait for the posts by sjw about wow allowing people to strip dead women npcs
wow,removed,twitchtvbylekoyd sick new wow stream awesome pvp action chill music check him out
wow,removed,never gonna use that silly title anyway atleast i feel a bit better since im not ret i mean the ashbringer is the ashbringer but the silver hand could just be some mass produced titan forged hammer since its too small to actually be either tyrs hand or his hammer like uther and arthas had similar hammers feels more paladin than the sword anyway also im a champion of the silver hand an argent champion you could sayleticiacrowelluscsalvationarmyorg
wow,removed,eat a dick
wow,removed,he had to retreat that hadnt happened before and had the plague not been there the fight would very likely have ended with the lk killing everyone and everything yeah it would have been a real shame if the elite forces of the alliance and horde had been wiped out at wrathgate with our greatest heroes being raised as champions of the lich king that would have been a whole lot worse than what really happened which was that the elite forces of the alliance and horde were wiped out at wrathgate and our greatest heroes were raised as champions of the lich king if you are somehow suggesting that wrathgate was the precipice of oblivion and that it was only thanks to the forsaken that we were saved from the dastardly lich king and his plot to destroy the world then i really have to question how attention you paid to wotlk it was not some grand and epic battle to decide the fate of the world it was literally just the alliance and horde trying to bust into icecrown with elite forces and failing thanks to the valuable contributions of the forsaken also losing their capital was not something that could have been prevented or had been caused by using the plague anyway its unrelated apart from it all happening at the same time lol the forsaken are constantly in pursuit of power making deals with all kinds of devils to get the strength that they want they dont even want the power to save people but rather just to fuck the world over with horrific biological weapons beyond the scope of anything you could imagine they make deals with the most evil of demons and some of the greatest enemies that azeroth has ever known yet it was a total fucking shock that it all ended up backfiring im sorry but if you think that the forsakens absolute obsession with the plague and power had nothing to do with the battle for the undercity then you really didnt pay attention the priorities of the forsaken directly led to the loss of their capital because if they hadnt spent of their time trying to build a bigger and better plague then putress would not have had the power needed to execute his plans immense influence was given to untrustworthy individuals because the forsaken cant stand the thought of not brutally boiling their enemies to death in green goo and look at the paladin campaign giving a dreadlord power not necessarily a bad thing seems theyre not inherently evil sylvanas had him on a short leash until the wrath gate occurred and he started working together with putress firstly were not talking about your average everyday dreadlord were talking about one of the three leaders responsible for executing the scourge attack on azeroth they are evil to the very core secondly she definitely did not keep him on a very short leash since he was shown to be in contact with his brother balnazzar at no point did she actually have his loyalty and she was an absolute idiot to ever trust him not the worgen they had a choice die or join the alliance so you get their help they locked themselves away saying fuck everyone and everything we dont want anything to do with you for a long time had they not needed help they wouldnt have left gilneas i dont even know what youre trying to say its clear that the worgen have a much greater appreciation for the nature of azeroth than the forsaken and you dont even need to look any further than the fact that the worgen have such a strong druidic tradition on top of that alliance worgen do not actively go out and infect the unwilling with their curse whereas the forsaken are happy to do so at any opportunity its overwhelmingly clear which group values azeroth more and which values themselves more i think its very telling how you happen to gloss over the fact that they would have been perfectly content to stay isolated if the horde hadnt invaded their country they were completely justified in isolating themselves away after the second war and it was only after the forsaken destroyed their wall that they actually accepted the help of the alliance you also seem to be making the incredibly incorrect assumption that the alliance spurned the forsaken while accepting the gilneas with open arms it was not the alliance that mistreated the forsaken during their birth but rather the shattered remains of lordaeron stormwind was completely separated from the issue and was dealing with a host of its own issues yet the forsaken are more than happy to pin the sins of a desperate and broken people on the inhabitants of an entirely different continent simply because both commit the sin of being living humans yes because burning people alive or freezing them to death or whatnot is definitely a parallel to bombs i think you are being intentionally dense at this point it really reads like you are just forgetting to type s napalm does not violate international law biological weapons do the plague was able to touch the lich king the dragons werent even able to hurt him and at the end of the day the dragons of wow are pretty useless with a few key exceptions funny how you dont compare the plague to the light which was capable of actually getting the job done instead of just tickling him and causing temporary discomfort long history of stabbing others in the back ill go ahead and say humans more so than the forsaken most of the forsaken are pretty much undead humans so obviously theyre going to be a lot alike this isnt game of thrones humans in wow are generally pretty fallible but are rarely as duplicitous as the forsaken humans build alliances and literally have an inherent bonus to reputation gain forsaken dont even start out at friendly with the horde on kalimdor that alone speaks volumes about which race is more prone to backstabbing
wow,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
wow,removed,the only one i can think of is a toy from the timeless isle something warhorn iirc blizz decided to go full fuckboy at some point in wod and made it only useable in pandarus though so none of this helps
wow,removed,obviously if were being completely objective and ignore the fact that once in a while we could go out of our way a tiny bit and help those with less experiencegear but the fact these people are getting called morons is just fucking uhughuhaudjkasdasd just who the fuck do you think you are uladykayko get your head out of your ass

wow,removed,prydaz is currently one of the strongest due to its overbuff for every class and role dont talk if you dont know what youre talking about
wow,removed,boo fucking hoo suck it up you lil bitch honestly
wow,removed,youre not alone ive suffered depression and anxiety most of my life i got into wow at a pretty low point and id go as far as saying the escape may have saved my life at the time the game was first released i had friends bugging me to play but i had next to no interest i had a good job and a girl that i was about to propose to then everything broke i lost the job due to layoffs i thought this may be a good thing i was still living separate from the girlfriend i could move in with or at least closer to her and find something temporary id already planned on proposing that weekend had the ring already and a plan on how to ask her the plan for the night failed she was complaining of a migraine and just wanted to go home and sleep ok ill figure something else out this weekend the next morning i was stressing hard trying to figure out how to ask since the plan fell through when i get the we need to talk from her she broke up with me when i had the engagement ring in pocket totally blindsided found out not long later that shed already been fucking one of her coworkers and his girlfriend so in comes wow escape im no longer dwelling on how livid i am over the whole situation and how worthless i felt having those things happen at the same time
wow,removed,gypped like by a gypsy
wow,removed,im with you for vanilla as there really was an advantage to being an alliance player even if i dont like the onyxia argument ive always been an alliance player so i can only tell you about the difference i perceive from that point and that is that for those horde expansions the difference for me was that some really prominent horde character was in your face for a lot of the questing experience and also present during raids and such at least it felt like it while in vanilla there certainly was alliance story being told you werent really ordered around by alliance champions being insulted glorious soo or kill stealed etcetera im not sure how wotlk felt as a horde player but i feel that arthas was actually an antagonist to both factions though the alliance flavor was certainly stronger in addition to those things it came right after the devastation that was cataclysm if you look at all the territory that was lost it certainly made sense to redistribute but it was usually lost to a fight to the horde without any kind of repercussions the alliance was beaten and defeated on multiple fronts we lost memorable and beautiful places our stories that were told were cut short and it was all followed up by multiple expansion that further increased the focus on the horde side of things it was going as far as more or less telling alliance players to go and read a book to actually understand what happened can be a nice summary though its quite dated and im glad the last expansion didnt come to pass
wow,removed,stop playing on private servers
wow,removed,he may not be a pvper i never do pvp personally even tho i know i would get my legendaries upgraded slightly faster its just not fun to me
wow,removed,shut the fuck up players that are actually hardcore about grinding dont do it on multiple characters because it would make absolutely no sense
wow,removed,okie dokey enjoy being unjustifiable in your stances ill make sure to follow you around a bit to make sure you dont give anyone else such shit advice
wow,removed,no one wants to group with people that cant speak the primary language of the game have no fucking idea what theyre doing back in lk i was unfortunate enough to be clustered in with the br troll realms like ragnaros seeing br players with points in a single talent tree not uncommon at all

wow,removed,i linked facts wake the fuck up retard
wow,removed,ladies and gentlemen i present to you redshirt
wow,removed,you should probably stop being a hype sheep piece of shit this isnt vanilla you retard so the fact youre bringing it up like everything has to be like it once was shows youre a retard they are coming off a crippling expansion in which of the subscribers left because of shit we are approaching that same point in time with another shit expansion so well see what happens again wod fell to millionish subscribers and you cant even easily find out how many copies of legion sold to date they are doing what you love as stupid fucking hype sheep and just saying how they sold million copies at launch which is really inaccurate since they trolled for a year to preorder the damn thing
wow,removed,no youre a retard for thinking i was talking about the moose mount wasnt that a heroic kill mount im talking about mythic mount kills which you have of
wow,removed,illidan pops up kills guldan and tells us we are going to space
wow,removed,yes then better downvote the guy into repeatedly for no reason why are you guys so silly and fickle he made a mistake does that mean every single person who comes thereafter needs to hit the downvote arrow too
wow,removed,at that point youre a retard and will be a bad tank with or without defensive stance
wow,removed,you might be the funniest triggered retard ive seen on reddit in a while thanks for that have a nice day
wow,removed,found the retard
wow,removed,yesterday evening i opted to have a quick dinner at subway i enjoy their moderate prices and fresh vegtables i got my typical order of a footlong tuna salad sub with extra cucumbers and italian dressing on wheat with a bag of baked lays and a diet dr pepper the total came to which is fairly affordable for such a mild meal but after i ordered the problems began as the customer service representative was finishing my sandwich i had the urge to use the mens room i excused myself and took care of business when i returned the teller was glaring at me and didnt wish me a nice evening after the transaction was complete i sat and ate my meal in silence and then left i didnt even feel comfortable reading one of their complementary newspapers it should be the responsibility of all employees to make the customers feel welcome and happy i didnt have a good experience and was hoping to get in touch with someone at subways corporate office who do you think i should direct my question to

wow,removed,lol youre either starting to troll or youre retarded theres no antihomosexuality here just a remark implying that if you want a nonsexual reference if blizzard was a person youd eat his shit gladly if he told you to to try to draw social issues from this instead of having the sense to get what i was implying tells me that youre probably a kid or an anal sjw though plus if you really want to get into that shit i didnt imply anything negative or anything about homosexuality as a matter of fact regardless of whether its male or female gobbling nuts it implies a sense of sovereigntysubmission for the two involved and my point still stands arent you the homophobic fuck that first tried to connect it to something negative about homosexuality dont try to translate your insecurities onto other people you bigoted prick and while positive reinforcement is nice sadly it doesnt fix the issues when the matter of discussion has its share of cons it was a haphazardly done event that of course had its share of pros that you so adamantly focus on im simply pointing out the negatives many of which got changed because people had enough sense to complain about it instead of being a nuthugger like you again regardless of your gender if you like to hug someones nuts thats quite an unconditional love right there just thought youd need this added explanation since you seem to have a single digit iq id suppose youre the type to fangasm at the old ass abomination model or the shitastic wraith walk animation blizzard said is only a placeholder but yet put into live have fun with your event lol im done reading your dumbass replies that never had substance in the first place
wow,removed,kill yourself
wow,removed,nice projection

wow,removed,watch plz
wow,removed,there is a reason they call brazil brown russia
wow,removed,new weaponcentered animation you mean the same that priests use or any class with an artifact ability that uses staffs nice try oh wow updated effect in the entirety of arcanes history and thats a fact just compare balance effects and arcane effects or even fire mages for that sake the difference is just beyond laughable and the fact that druids are again the first to get even more spell effects while arcanes been neglected since forever makes blizzards favoritism more than obvious
wow,removed,damn bro
wow,removed,yeah it would be so cool if you could actually do that in the game just hold your weapon out like that and blue snowflakes fall down to runeforge it thats much cooler than porting to acherus and going to a forge
wow,removed,the worst show on tv
wow,removed,on heroic look out everyone we got a bad ass over here
wow,removed,back in the old days tabards were literally just decorative they didnt become useful until wrath with rep tabards

wow,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpgxefsuvja
wow,removed,false info calm down dipshit it was a joke
wow,removed,reported from who no people got unbanned yet
wow,removed,youre a fucking idiot
wow,removed,yeah basicly u called me a retard and u said u wont respond anymore great also the argument of being on the market for years and still not being balanced is not anything good shows how lazy blizzard is with this stuff check the ti again and see how many picks there were yeah some are niche but still thats a good turnout considering the nature of the game
wow,removed,last year was great
wow,removed,slut
wow,removed,well you sound like an idiotarsehole now i know to never visit your stream
wow,removed,because you went full autistic mode and claimed how unbelievable and fake it was to have an artifact at level in a couple days really it should be level within a few hours of hitting its like you havent even played the game your first shouldve been lvl from leveling and before that day was over good luck with the stream you fucking retard
wow,removed,the people in that thread that are literally nolife posting to try and manhunt people down and make sure no matter what that someone is punished are so pathetic like yea punish the people obviously but these retards that arent even involved care more about these people being caught than anything happening in their real lives its pathetic
wow,removed,no it isnt you insanely obsessed little shitter
wow,removed,then they went back and beat it before anyone else on alts proving they werent exploiting and slapping all of you obsessed insane people and blizzard right in the mouth
wow,removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
wow,removed,i use it when i cant be fucked doing lfrnorm for the nth time in a week i bot bgs when i cant be fucked leveling honor because simply why not when blizzard doesnt do anything about it
wow,removed,doot doot
wow,removed,youre not just wasting your time by taking minutes to out groups together youre wasting other peoples time we clear weekly and have nearly no problems group compis important but im not waiting minutes for a shaman or mage when i have drums in my bag get over yourself prick
wow,removed,yea i couldnt care less it just leads to people who could never clear mythic complaining about the difficulty of the content en mythic is so easy then why do most people not have on here lol
wow,removed,trying to push your stream why dont you eat some shit you stupid bitch lil bits
wow,removed,new class jew abilities throw coin yd range deal ap to target costs per damage point muh shekels heal self for ap restores per health healed hide in attic the jew enters stealth plug showerhead removes all poison and disease from the target board the train deal damage to target equal to gold currently carried then you die horribly
wow,removed,you seem to struggle with comprehension as well as what common discussion is which is fine everyone cannot have the intellect required to have proper discussions
wow,removed,tfw banwave no ban tfw salty fucks complain about le big bad botters tfw people actually sit around doing shit they dont enjoy on a game
wow,removed,new class jew abilities throw coin yd range deal ap to target costs per damage point muh shekels heal self for ap restores per health healed hide in attic the jew enters stealth plug showerhead removes all poison and disease from the target board the train deal damage to target equal to gold currently carried then you die horribly
wow,removed,pet damage is the same across all archetypes now so your pet choice will be catered around what exotic ability you want lust brez etc so id suggest getting a corehound stork and waterstrider check your artifact progression with the icy veins path stack more mastery as you go along secondary stats trump ilvl and just work the kinks out of your rotation for a decent baseline try the tellmewhen add on with the bm template from mmo champ to get a feel for what your rotation should be like
wow,removed,this sub isnt really designed for people like me people with low tolerance for bullshit like most gigantic subreddits theres an extremely high noisesignal ratio so when people throw me bullshit meh i just throw bullshit right back at em thats how it works right i mean its not like the mods care about it
wow,removed,yea crybaby you can equip a random ilvl in your legendary slots if you think your ilvl items with absurd high stats and an extra effect without any drawback is not enough for you fking retard
wow,removed,mentally ill protesting the right to be a slut and to reveal themselves in public are angry that a man revealed himself in public
wow,removed,blizzards own client allows streaming to facebook without crossing out names so why are you doing it think about it before you answer people are streaming to twitch and facebook right now and no names are crossed out while doing so why because theyre not real namestheyre pseudonyms why are you blocking out pseudonyms
wow,removed,its easier to harass on reddit than it is in wow wow has a terms of use policy that harshly punishes people for harassment whereas on reddit you could just keep making free accounts in seconds and continue harassing an individual with impunity so why didnt you cross out your reddit name
wow,removed,i buy some games off they all worked so far and i also buy my gametime cards fom there
wow,removed,get out of here you have no idea what your talking about
wow,removed,you might need to work on your reading comprehension you downvoting helpful moron why the fuck would phorfaber say that western plaguelands is out of the way so you have to sit around and wait if he knew there was a portal to dalaran in the paladin class hall what is he waiting for huh could it be the cooldown for his dalaran hearthstone the fact that he emphasizes that the advantage of the druid order hall is that it has a portal to dalaran forther points to the fact that he possibly doesnt know he can come back from the paladin order hall go and be helpful to someone else i am talking to phorfaber about class hall portals here okay
wow,removed,qwenjqwehjipweqmqwerlqwae
wow,removed,went full retard with second post
wow,removed,because pet battles are cancer and one of the worst things introduced to wow
wow,removed,but ive never been raped or sexually assaulted that means you are actually a white hetorosexual male in disguise
wow,removed,hey maybe its when you wipe at maybe you cant raid because youre an idiot not because you work
wow,removed,except it moves the base up from to
wow,removed,all i know is that i hope hillary clinton gets cancer
wow,removed,well if youre going to be a little bitch about it the from the bottom is also skyrim and the from the top is too
wow,removed,stop linking this retarded shit
wow,removed,humble brag god teach me to fish for likes
wow,removed,got my first legendary was sephuz secret proceeded to cancel my subscription
wow,removed,i play on with all advanced setting on and i get if i turn my limit off in dalraids in suramar specs intel quadcore ram radeon ocd to
wow,removed,gamebreaking isnt a very valid description of a bug that happens during an event that gives nothing that matters
wow,removed,til wanting to participate in content is needy
wow,removed,the whole world doesnt revolve around you jackass
wow,removed,timewalking dungeons pair you with i never noticed
wow,removed,you sound like a very unpleasant person so im just going to tag you as a bitch and stop replying to you
wow,removed,look at this guys history of posts full of old lady porn
wow,removed,information just or search rwow for kosumoth i mean its been posted about like times since it was discovered
wow,removed,how could you possibly fucking fail to find info on it jesus christ
wow,removed,good maybe blizzard will trash this shitty fucking idea and stop recycling content maybe this subreddit will finally pull its collective head from its asshole and realize timewalking is recycled horribly made content that they love for no reason
wow,removed,youre a lazy fuck the kosumuth experience cant really be expressed in a sentence
wow,removed,its beacuse you are too stupid to realize the help he gave you was literally just googling kosomuth and clicking the link when people used to ask me on youtube where i got my tabs from in my videos it fucking irritated me to no end that you and they dont grasp the concept of googling something he didnt give you any more information than you couldve found yourself but you made an entire comment about it and sit there waiting for someone to tell you to click his very name on of all places wow head how dense can you be now that you know what he ishas are you not going to attempt to become attuned im sure you are so guess what you need the guides
wow,removed,must be a sad life to judge people on not enjoying old content being recycled and shoved down their throats but instead of actually point out why you think its a good system just try and make baseless insults because you cant think of a valid reason to reuse shitty outdated content that deserves to be left behind if people want to see it they can go see it i dont like having bonus roll tokens and raiding level chest rewards tied to this horseshit
wow,removed,they still use some form of communication and are an organized group soooooo they did what most raiding guilds and pugs do and down bosses kudos to them and your humble brag on your guild
wow,removed,you sound like a flaming douchebag do you realize this
wow,removed,damn dude also hey there insanctylem yeah you failed at covering your name big time
wow,removed,cringey as fuck
wow,removed,they aren´t fucking fun though unless you are a litteral retard who enjoys drolling on his keyboard
wow,removed,im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay im gay
wow,removed,the lowest end of wow fucking retard player as possible to see by keybinds and asks gold for a tele wtf
wow,removed,king varian dies
wow,removed,yeah sure sucks youre fucking retarded and you know it
wow,removed,real women craving attention kek
wow,removed,thats right u mad
wow,removed,its unclear if you want to be inside the photo or inside the outfit or inside her
wow,removed,i dont even know what draneor is and who the fk cares what a litch king is not me lame ass tolkien knock off wanna bees
wow,removed,u mad also i did your mom
wow,removed,clearly you are not aware of what you wrote you inbred fuck
wow,removed,wow nice cosplay you look like youd smell nice hhehehe xd im jealous of ur skin
wow,removed,wait wtf i didnt know these things existed i play on emerald dream and its the last server that wpvpthis is going to be gay af some of these are way over the top next thing you know wow becomes world of diablo with warcraft skin
wow,removed,my boyfriend and i awwww you just made all the nerds cry p
wow,removed,s according to wowpedia
wow,removed,my boyfriend i found the exact point where people stopped reading
wow,removed,is that a spoiler hmm o
wow,removed,could be a ddos from poodlecorp they said that they were gonna attack pokemon go servers maybe they got overzealous also i found that the head if poodlecorp is selling his services to ddos other sites how come no one stops this shit
wow,removed,if someone has a spare i could really use one as well
wow,removed,i am eu as well if someone has a spare it would be greatly appreciated
wow,removed,and if you are a women that explains a lot lol
wow,removed,just unsub this fucking game
wow,removed,except for enchanting that is stupid expensive
wow,removed,this may be petty but thank god varian is dying one less character for metzen to voice seriously its hard not to notice him doing his voice on nearly every character once you recognize it
wow,removed,remindme days download enemy grid
wow,removed,its part of the involvement of playing the class really its why people who tank tank instead of dps or healing they enjoy the added responsibility and enjoy dictating the pace yes its harder and you will get trolls but really just say something in group if its bothering you ie please dont pull just let me if they still dont listen vote to kick this isnt call of duty and most people will change their behavior if you simply say something is bothering you
wow,removed,class halls send you on missions that make you explore the world could have a class mission send you to the old raid to clear it and obtain the item obtained from the last boss or a specific boss related to the mission sooooo you want to add portals to take away the exploration
wow,removed,lmao the age old argument of dont use it yea i stopped reading after that good luck with it i guess i still do not support
wow,removed,but people who want to be toxic will find a way regardless through whispering or relogging or blocking to find a name to harass a player assuming everyone is going to be an abusive cunt is rather cynical
wow,removed,first it holds zero water its a straw man argument just like saying well there is this less health debuff on mythic raids but you can just right click it off if you want to make it harder no one is going to realistically take the harder approach i am sure your next reply well go something like well some people can choose to make it harder just stop there is a reason this post as a big ol points and your forum post has negative points also couldnt care less what you think of my opinion this is a very poor change that is not needed and definitely not worth the developer time to put in effect someone pointing out that its a bad idea does not make them high and mighty but if thats what helps you sleep at night by all means i am just that nasty ol shitter that shit all over your obvious glorious idea disabling inbox replies for this comment chain since i honestly dont care what your next reply is and this thread will be buried in a couple hours
wow,removed,wow what would i have done without that correction i thank you sir for saving my life now fuck off you dumb retard
wow,removed,i am sorry but i am not reading that make it like lines short i am going to bed and i am not in the mood for an internet argument as i told you friend there
wow,removed,i have a ton of complaints as a horde player and how theyre currently dealing with our lore and the sudden abrupt usage of voljin in a terrible way not to mention he was benched for an entire expansion
wow,removed,because alliance player whining did you see how it went at the end of mop i play alliance and i thought they were whiny ass bitches
wow,removed,you sir win the idiot award of the day
wow,removed,the blatant favortism was having your human racial go unchecked for years ally having a huge advantage in av and still do you still have an op ne racial that lets you run like a bitch anyways alliance can get these toys from a vendor in new dalaran so quit your bitchin
wow,removed,i have several characters on both factions on multiple servers i am still going to main a dh this xpac the mobility alone is worth it to me i also do not really like what they have done to frost dk so far so yes i will be a dh main this xpac
wow,removed,y u roll on pvp server if u bad or cry bb
wow,removed,uhm lore things going on at the same time that cancel each other out roll the event on another toon pretty simple but to say it is stupid because an mmorpg makes a quest chain based on lore is pretty fucking stupid
wow,removed,jeez they are blind buy you dont have to rub it in
wow,removed,wow dude did it take practice to get that dumb
wow,removed,please we have known that voljin and varian dies since like january if you havent had that spoiled yet you have legit been without a internet connection since betaalpha rolled out
wow,removed,the newest hero down syndrooome
wow,removed,its a treasure
wow,removed,maybe i like community and self made summary comments as opposed to watching a nerd orgasm for an hour and a half on youtube you fat asshole
wow,removed,its really not unless you suffer from severe autism
wow,removed,even the quest line taking you to the kings death i havent really read into it much sorry if i sound stupid
wow,removed,since the announcement of legion varians charactar has been so much more cool i really really like him its such a shame he had to go down
wow,removed,im not even the person who made the joke retard no wonder you cant tell sarcasm when you cant even read properly
wow,removed,if youre a retard sure if youre halfsmart youll realize the points im trying to make is that there should at least be a way to heal yourself or maybe not have the stacks reset upon death
wow,removed,haha what a retard
wow,removed,are you brain damaged more buttons absolutely increases complexity are you trying to say spamming ice lance is equally as difficult as a catamop spriest or affliction rotation more buttons means there are more decisions more things to keep track of and more buttons to press
wow,removed,remindme years did anduin become a paladin like ufourecho predicted that would be pretty cool
wow,removed,thats the definition of pvp you fucking retard if you only want to pvp when its convenient then play on a pve server that its literally how they work fuck you are stupid
wow,removed,shut your filthy casual mouth
wow,removed,you didnt knock down anything everyone in here knows youre a fucking idiot the dh is probably your only level toon and youre pissed about the quest there lore prevents it from happening and youre dumb enough to say there game dont give a shit obviously it does you fucking moron you honestly deserve cancer
wow,removed,this
wow,removed,ah yes honor the rallying cry of mass murderers bullies and psychopaths who think if they can justify their atrocities via a code of ethics then its not really their fault honor demanded it religion may be the biggest cause of murder and war in history and politics the second but honor is definitely the third
wow,removed,triggered how do you know how does hesheit identify check your priviledges
wow,removed,if that makes you foam at the mouth you must be having a rough life
wow,removed,archimonde is highly unlikely dead
wow,removed,there are lots of ways blizzard could play it my guess is that his soul is gone has been sent to the twisting nether and replaced by a demons soul and thats why the light went out im guessing theres a quest to get varians sword back as part of bringing him back from the twisting nether to kill whatever abomination guldan has created in varians place i should point out i havent done any of the beta so these are guesses on my part i didnt want to spoil the expansion at release
wow,removed,yeah bye retardo
wow,removed,well there you go i was right case closed
wow,removed,go the fuck away nobody gives a shit there has been a month of non stop complaining about this bullshit on this fucking subreddit from people like you that dont realise that we give no fucking shit what you think you posting this is the equivalent of wiping your rotting feces on the side of a bathroom stall we all have to look at it and wonder who was fucking idiotic enough to put it there while we wait for a janitor mod to clean it off if you like playing vanilla fucking hooray for you go play it wait for it to get shit down and shit the fuck up with your entitled preaching about it here
wow,removed,since when does jon snow ride a gyphon
wow,removed,talk about a land whale
wow,removed,yeah posting the fat leg of his gf is definitely more than rshitpost
wow,removed,well if you are a healer you are a girl or gay so this makes total sense to me
wow,removed,just a thought here wouldnt this project be aimed more at helping the guilds who are not at the top of the ladder i think top guilds typically have people who are very good at putting together a good comp and optimizing gear their feedback may be valuable while assembling the project but id venture to guess you would get a lot more exposure by aiming this at the guilds who are lead by people with less experience and would really benefit from those types of insights its a cool project i hope to see more about this as you develop
wow,removed,idiot nothing wrong with using shortcuts i still bot because why the fuck not
wow,removed,try doing more dps and not being bad
wow,removed,the difference is if you arent a complete retard botting on wow is guaranteed return with risk this is much harder to do with a bank robbery if you cant even see this lol
wow,removed,not using a bg bot to grind op why live
wow,removed,ashran is bad enough dont need latam shitters to make it worse
wow,removed,easy to enjoy it when your other alternative is getting farmed at lel
wow,removed,cry harder and git gud next time fgt
wow,removed,do black people punch harder thinking of race changing to human neg for bik dik dps
wow,removed,lol fail as fuck wiping to xavius basically last tier content at this point
wow,removed,what is your mother is a whore
wow,removed,muh dps in dungeons is fucking terrible since the nerf even tho it didnt do that much not that i could out dps real classes anyway im got the ringand abusing double proc when i can using misery and shadowcrash and i do godawful dps even in high m like onwards dont really do anything past usually impossible to get into groups and guild isnt up for it but even then i feel like garbage cos anybody does easily doubletripple my dps and before i finished up dotting everything they are mostly dead c i dont wanna be a burden halp
wow,removed,so basically the us right now

wow,removed,some zones were updated in cata but all of them were given the cata load screen plaguelands afaik were untouched
wow,removed,just one thinghe needs badlydyed blondorange hair
wow,removed,id make the warlock himself the tank and the demons he summons buff him eg one for a shield one for a damage mitigation one for self heals etc
wow,removed,the game doesnt exist in a vacuum they were well aware of how the player base distributed loot dkp is one of the many reasons why they have added alternative means of gearing badges raids coins mythics
wow,removed,oh god its hillary
wow,removed,if you are not then see about getting them to say sexual things to you file a report with blizzard about pedophilia harassment and watch the ensuing shitstorm
wow,removed,damn is your gf single
wow,removed,grinding has never had this much impact on character power i have been playing since vanilla legion is probably the best wow has ever been in my eyes but its grinding is extreme even by wow and mmo standards
wow,removed,wow everyone is getting cool unique mounts wonder what im going to get sees retard protodrake lookalike fuck
wow,removed,you didnt ruin anything op ruined it by being a cuck about your response
wow,removed,well committing suicide is haram

wow,removed,well i dont know man ofc it sounds racist but the message was that he is angry at people who sells gold and that is it i think that he is not angry on whole asian race but rather more angry at people who sell gold and do not get punished
wow,removed,hes not wrong though fuck their spam and fuck this new silencing system
wow,removed,meanwhile they dont address the issues of subreddit moderation and the fact that certain subreddits have come under the control of power tripping cucks in fact they made the situation far worse by adding an admin message to each subreddit ban saying that theyll ban your reddit account if you dare circumvent the ban by posting on another account and by giving moderators the ability to rudely mute people
wow,removed,it encourages cyberbullying through the idea of a mob mentality except no it doesnt just saying it doesnt make it true player a needs to learn how to control himself player a knew the rules and chose to violate them player a is now mad because he got punished for breaking the rules why do you think player a shouldnt have to obey the rules

wow,removed,most of the replies are telling you to fucking quit already its obviously your whiny baby back bitch tone you have ps orange text wont make up for the fact that the people beating you are likely better players to begin with
wow,removed,i think that tirion doesnt actually die i mean the entire scene is super weak for such a major characters death plus if you go into icecrown and click on tirion before fighting the lich king he has new sound bytes ones of pain and anguish and begging

wow,removed,ah yes copying the person youre replying to in order to troll get the last word in make yourself seem spicy and intelligent gain attention toward yourself and other members of your subreddit i dont give a crap about politics but please dont drag this shit in here to try and push an agenda its incredibly easy to see through you guys reply thats either trolling off topic trying to deflect in order to act bigger etc rather than addressing the actual issue or take any form of responsibility
wow,removed,youre the exact reason that sub sucks
wow,removed,so your guild master was a fucking retard sounds awesome im glad i never met them basically if you are on an achievement run like this and someone does something like that not only are they banned from the run but they are likely kicked from the guild if i am gm
wow,removed,httpslmgtfycomqopisfuckingstupidandlazy
wow,removed,buy heirloom gear with it if you head over to ironforge via the deeprun tram theres an npc in the hall of mysteries that sells heirloom gear heirloom gear scales with you as you level is generally stronger than any blue gear you find in dungeons and keeps you from spending gold on upgrades at low levels you can buy yourself the sword and shield upgrade them to scale up to level and not need an upgrade until you get to draenor
wow,removed,you just clear en like normal is the loot not enough anymore
wow,removed,they still have time to take the currently hopeful elemental shaman and show them a new low please shut your whore mouth you shut it right now begins sobbing
wow,removed,relevant
wow,removed,did anyone else sing it
wow,removed,america is at the height of racial equality gender equality sexual equality etc the fact that that is what the altright and the mainstream right that have put stock into trump believe makes america bad is racist sexist homophobic etc build a wall is racism not because of wanting to secure borders but because its the murderers and rapists of mexico that are allegedly coming to america despite no evidence supporting that wild claim voting for trump after he was caught not just admitting but gloating about sexual misconduct in the workplace and using his position to abuse women is misogynistic and sexist the republican party seeing that trump doesnt care either way about the lgbt appointed mike pence a religious zealot that thinks taxpayer money is better spent on conversion therapy than aids recovery centers that would be the homophobic part so yeah maga is a racist misogynistic homophobic sentiment

wow,removed,i got my key from a website called gittigidiyor which is kinda ebay of turkey i still got the boost
wow,removed,if you dont need it and if youre not even gonna disenchant it its purely retarded to not give the item to someone who needs it

wow,removed,and im the first one to accept blame when im the one thats actually at fault on posts like these people seem to forget this dps or healer or tank barely anyone considers the possibility that they are the problem
wow,removed,fuck youre a stain lol
wow,removed,oh look i found a retard
wow,removed,i dont think it was very subtle but yes i just wanted to insult the design team whoever did this needs to hear about it
wow,removed,i honestly dont want to be associated with anyone who cannot handle simple raid mechanics not in real life or in game so for me it is constructive
wow,removed,idiot
wow,removed,i actully should take a medicine xd went to the doctor and gave me the paper to buy some pills but forgot to buy it damn
wow,removed,nah its not that bad man i could be aliens
wow,removed,hopefully holinka takes notice of this and leaves the industry
wow,removed,no offense but as a non american youre probably the last person to ask for advice on building a pc pc and pc gaming has always been an american thing we invented both so it would be like going to a brazilian to learn the history of the english language it makes no sense thats why the vast majority of users in the pcmr are american
wow,removed,or those groups that let you clear the entire instance except for the last boss and then kick you for no reason right as youre about to pull kick reason jajajajajajaja server ragnaros the jajas are on you though i may have to reque but you are permanently bad

wow,removed,kill yourself
wow,removed,geez poor guy its like a beaten puppy who only wants to make you happy to much feels for a friday its because of the elitist shit bags that people feel this way they are scared that if they arent insert spec theyll be kicked and or shunned
wow,removed,just a thought dude wow might be ruining your life not saving it go for a long walk in the woods go hunting and kill some shit do human things try meditation yoga working out go for a run everyday instead of a run in the game play some loud as fuck music and scream your lungs out go express yourself you may be depressing yourself i have struggled with the same at times so i realize its easier said than done but humans arent meant to be sitting in a chair staring at a screen all day were meant to be going out doing shit hunting and fucking bitches surviving i personally believe depression is a symptom of our society not a natural occurrence in your brain surely depression is normal in times of loss and such but permanent depression may very well not be a thing ill probably get downvoted for saying this on a gaming subreddit but whatever i hope it helps man
wow,removed,and wow contains my violent urges very helpful indeed
wow,removed,i suffer from severe depression along with ptsd i play to hours a day are you though diagnosed by psychiatrists opinion everything or are you selfdiagnosed to provide an excuse for playing wow hoursday and whatever else has gone south in your life have you tried all the various med combos electroshock group therapy occupational therapy etc no way a licensed professional will tell you hrsday wow is beneficial to treating your obviously extremely severe illnesses so how is wow saving your life just be real aware that there are millions of people of all ages without depression andor ptsd that do addictive activities all day long maybe mmos maybe video poker maybe tv watching in fact for someone in the midst of a bout of actual severe clinical depression playing video games let alone all day every day is not something they are likely to be doing
wow,removed,you made a post about not liking a huge integral part of the game i suggested with no venom at all that you stop playing if you hate the concept so much you reply with vitriol and personal attacks i suggest you take a moment and think about that for a moment
wow,removed,wow is a mmorpg if you dont want to interact with people you should play a game that doesnt require you to be online and interact with other people

wow,removed,and what does that have to do with the fact that i could have the same exact gear as another shaman yet pull less dps because i had bad rng the dps you do is and forever will be determined moreso by rng than anything else in the bracket rng literally rules the top end of performance the fact that legendaries happen to be rng completely fits with the high performance landscape perfectly the fact of the matter is however that you dont need to be lucky to completely clear all the content

wow,removed,i hate when games come out with remastered editions and then charge damn near full price this is exactly that no its not you fucking braindead moron the gear is not what you are paying for item models are not content you are paying for the leveling experience storyline dungeons updated pvp raids etc this has nothing to do with the price of the game at least have a rational complaint

wow,removed,i take it youre either not a dk or just dont know how to play one optimally
wow,removed,nothing better than a single downvote good job bud youre too fucking dumb to support your argument time to move on
wow,removed,you know why it beats arms sidewinders thats it irrelevant why it beats arms it becomes shit and the rest of the talents for mm hunters are shit and if you think that what they did to arms is okay then that should be just fine in the meantime stop whining because a spec beats one in logs how about you learn to play the game and perhaps one day you will understand why the difference between melee and ranged is so big besides the one here bitching is you the moment fury beats arms in logs youll whine i dont know if you knew this but youre an asshole wrong about the topic as well theres no point discussing this with someone an assholeretard like you so i wont be replying anymore
wow,removed,you fucking mouthbreathers dude how simple does this have to be explained a mobility spell being part of your damage rotation does not negate it as a mobility option if mage blink did damage would that somehow make it worse it is honestly amazing the logic leaps here no hyperbole at all youre astoundingly dense
wow,removed,well if they put a space before the question mark its usually a big red sign of a retard so i think you dodged a bullet there tbqh
wow,removed,cant transfer tokens only way to get them for use is buying with gold
wow,removed,theyre very expensive on eu though maybe like double na
wow,removed,if you need more than fel rush charges to survivedps then blizzard should just cater to your handicapped needs this game should be disability friendly

wow,removed,cry more you picked the op class deal with it noob
wow,removed,withered training started out annoying then turned into useless i run through as a hunter facerolling everything not caring about what i pull and just raping everything in there and still coming out with a withered group all i go in there for is for that one chest at the end that wont contain an upgrade for me or a legendary you can pull the entire boss rooms with trash around it and down it so easily when you get all the chests it makes me wonder how long they actually spent planning this little minigame
wow,removed,sounds like not pitty this forum is just about memes
wow,removed,then unsub
wow,removed,thats not a problem what makes you think i cant click and move at the same time same for healing
wow,removed,tanks have been pretty much the only viable specs at super top end arena the last xpacs self healing defensive and being able to dish out all the same damage as a dps thats why they said what theyve said give it a fucking rest they are trying and now that you cant smash face you think its all gone into the shitter
wow,removed,reading these comments of yours had me dying lmao you seem like such a douche
wow,removed,you dont speak the entire fucking rotation what fantasy world are you living in you have a rotation and someone speaks up if they cant get next and people figure out who had one available rather than hoping someone reads it and people dont panic interrupt
wow,removed,not sure why youre personally offended by stuff i post that has no direct relevance to you
wow,removed,no you dont have to are you insane before the fight you say a gets b gets c gets etc when b fucks up he says cant interrupt e says i got it then it goes to c and back around what kind of guild are you in lol who mishears i cant get this one with macros whoever cant get one either has to type he cant get it which the ability has probably already gone off or whoevers next has to be fucking reading chat and have his off cdpray someone else gets it whos reading chat during a boss for some reason im sincerely confused what kind of raids youve been in
wow,removed,this will be my last post here posts again because hes too butthurt that the mages on rwow dont like or agree with him boo hoo
wow,removed,why are you such a judgmental ass

wow,removed,then they are all retards
wow,removed,my ex gf banged and cheated with a male stripper
wow,removed,why do people think this subreddit is the general forums
wow,removed,i think the problem is that were dedicated so much they dont want us to get early access because lets be honest no one plays beta and actually reports anything and if they do its like of the people they give it to new peoplefagstreamers to build up hype and try to grab new audiences because were already a sure thing
wow,removed,there could have been an advanced interface option for these same with the stat page if players couldnt handle all these options to the point that their heads explode they could just have them disabled by default and just players just enable them on thr advanced menu less doesnt always equal more here
wow,removed,
wow,removed,will you whining softcocks please harden the fuck up

wow,removed,try not being such a retard words have meanings i am objectively right look up objectively if you need to understand what that word means too
wow,removed,similar scenario id love to find a guild just content with blowing through a heroic raid once a week and then banging out mm or other world content but its inevitable as soon as heroic is on farm they drop it and move on wiping times a night on a mythic raid boss i simply dont have the patience or desire to wipe times a night multiple times a week and get screamed at by frustrated raid leaders fuck i hate mythic raiding i have no idea what drives people do to that miserable shit
wow,removed,not bad she looks like a proper cumslave

wow,removed,ty
wow,removed,thanks my dude
wow,removed,you are being way too autistic about it if it is a graphical setting that can be changed which it seems so then there are no issues there are slash commands that allow you to take the graphical settings beyond what they are in the options menu if this was not allowed blizzard would block them they have had to issues in the past with it and it has been around forever
wow,removed,lol you pull the aboms into the section prior on the steps no you didnt progress or rather you progressed with a retarded autistic group and your tanks sucked balls
wow,removed,upgraded trash is still trash
wow,removed,redditrwowservers
wow,removed,i like his movies but here he kinda screws up tbh first he sais you need to play what you like and not play something you dont enjoy and he has seen that time and time again and right after he sais that if you can be a tank or a healer you should be that if your class is able too i will main an enhance shamy and prolly warrior second taking i will do i enjoy that but no way on earth i will heal on my shaman you dont even want me as a healer i hate it just wont do it
wow,removed,congratulations on being one of the most ignorant people on reddit my apologies if you are literally mentally handicapped in real life in that case best wishes to your family

wow,removed,would rather kill myself than playing on this
wow,removed,except i dont fucking care about the average players hands look at lower average percentile parses classes are all over the place no where near where they should be not at all indicative of the specs capabilities
wow,removed,white men dont give a fuck about it youve obviously never been to the web site reddit before have you id also like to see the source for your must insulted stat
wow,removed,too fucking bad youre a clueless retard
wow,removed,bc fire is not in line and needs to get nerved in cleave or st it basically needs the outlaw treatment and this we dont want to force people to respec is a absolute joke rogues dks warriors all had to do exactly this no reason to give dumb mages sth special here
wow,removed,add in a exgirlfriend dummy or remove this one because fuck you blizzard if we cant have tracers ass because of sexisum then why is this fine
wow,removed,out of the bosses out atm only of them are pure single target soooooooooo i say take your barrage and go kill helya while im over hear basically required to keep demo up cuz its the spec i like and destro right behind it because its the spec needed in most of the current content

wow,removed,rlewronggeneration is leaking
wow,removed,whos to say theyre not
wow,removed,then keep playing fire if you enjoy it and while you do that grow a pair
wow,removed,if anything id expect outrage about how it portrays women as crazy and having very clingycreepy behavior
wow,removed,whys that because i dont appreciate music that sounds like we are mourning someone who isnt even dead you sound a bit pushy like you are trolling for some ragey responses
wow,removed,i guess its because most physical abuse around the world happens when a man beats a woman although women can do it its less likely women can for example cause great distress and mental abuse but that cant be proven as well as physical abuse you can always find something that will offend someone the best thing to do is to leave it if you dont like it you can write to blizzard thats alright i just think that the last couple of years has had a decent amount of feuds between genders especially concerning feminism what i always do is just ignore it i treat my mother sister and girl with respect and i wish them to have the same opportunities in life that i have but i dont liked being labeled as anything be it a capitalist feminist communist or socialist i believe in doing right thats all that matters to me the reason i dont believe in being labeled is because far too many people are using these isms for example in a wrong way racism has gone way out of hand the word racism i mean hope this didnt bore you haha just my opinion
wow,removed,that is not at all what happened thats the neckbeard keyboard warrior version ie reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee feminism and censorship reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee my tendies
wow,removed,you appear to have lost your way httpswwwtumblrcom thats where ya wanna be
wow,removed,not as crying on reddit xd
wow,removed,you do know this is a video game meant for fun right also affliction btw
wow,removed,yeah i started using ap in my lee artifact at the whining of the expansion then thought to myself what the fuck am i doing and immediately switched to enhance
wow,removed,seriously silly mra shit in wow in a game where men are still men and all female armor looks feminine
wow,removed,just like how the taste of poop is subjective most people will hate it if you are one of the few who enjoy eating poop then i feel sorry for you
wow,removed,unless youre pushing world content this doesnt even matter play whats fun chances are if youre good at it youll still outdps the majority of your raid
wow,removed,masculinity so fragile in here boys theres about a million things in wow that could be more offensive than this
wow,removed,yet the balance team not only considered but put it in the ptr so your logic is horrible
wow,removed,stop changing this reddit into tumblr
wow,removed,bitch shut the fuck up you aint god fool
wow,removed,sjws are sad little creatures
wow,removed,god dammit tumblr is leaking again
wow,removed,look youre being fucking dumb the hunters were in a riot throughout the testing period before legion against the changes coming in legion and the changes went through youre being downvoted for very good reasons what youre saying has no relationship with reality and is offensive to people who know very well and firsthand about these phenomena which you claim dont exist fuck your arrogance basically
wow,removed,you do know that this doesnt work anymore since mop p
wow,removed,isnt that the server where no one does real content instead they just sit in the inn and talk dirty to each other
wow,removed,is it okay when they turn it green cause you know no one likes green things
wow,removed,whats next you want pvp in a fantasy game gone too
wow,removed,dont make light of suicide fuck off suicide is fine life is not marvelous for everyone everyone needs to have the option to exit game it is the peak of selfishness to expect people to keep playing or living because you want them to play
wow,removed,funnily proving another point in the process op comes in to point out the hypocrisy if it was a woman youd all be pissed off people come in and provide evidence that society doesnt give two shits about men
wow,removed,but you can get the invite for the fox mount also from emisarry caches i got my fox from a nightfallen emessary cache
wow,removed,wheres that perculiapanserblizzardwatch outrage now
wow,removed,dunno how about some advertising here but here is cool wow server
wow,removed,take your namesake up your ass
wow,removed,go hang youreself
wow,removed,no you arent
wow,removed,because it is and stop crying fire mage will still be best spec of mage
wow,removed,what a huge wall of text because of less healing on passive small heal that doesnt contribute much anyway
wow,removed,i will never get how it is easier for people to sk google abut wow subbreddit then create an account and the post the question instead of just typing question in google
wow,removed,the difference is males can take a joke about this stuff the ones that cant are transgender
wow,removed,the difference is we are guys and shit like this doesnt really bother us cause we arent huge bitches that make a big deal out of everything this doesnt bother me in the slightest
wow,removed,literally who gives a fuck just because feminists whine doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level and whine too instead lets hope that one day the idiots and sjws who whine about things like tracer butt pose etc see the light
wow,removed,he wants to exploit it for as long as possible
wow,removed,tyrande silence is offensive but exboyfriend dummy is fine
wow,removed,a vast majority of the people is not offended by the name but annoyed that there is such a large double standard if this would indicate violence against females it would be talked about everywhere how distasteful that is
wow,removed,i think you need to develop a sense of humor nobody hears a racial joke and goes haha that was funny because other races are inferior to my own hahaha
wow,removed,oh you admitted that on your own without toture oo
wow,removed,the op is a pathetic human being for even suggesting the idea of taking it back a battlechest costs like nothing you sold the account and some dude may well have put years work in bought more expacs with their own cash to rip that away because you feel like playing again is disgusting im guessing you have aspergers or some kind of social disability to even think what you are planning is ok
wow,removed,hey please watch your language i know being a mod of a completely unless entity in any somewhatsuccessful persons life makes you feel empowered where you go around pounding your chest but please you calm down too
wow,removed,so you say for you a virtual item in a fantasy world promotes domestic violence if yes then you are the problem not the toy its a fun toy in a virtual reality where you slaughter humans dwarfs orcs elfs and all that is okay for you but the toy is the breaking point then wow is clearly not your game
wow,removed,its important to note that anything on the ptr right now is just the first iteration of the patch things will change if they dont im afraid mm hunters will riot harder than the liberal antitrumpers
wow,removed,its a joke and the guy is a retard
wow,removed,how is stabbing a caricature of an ex domestic violence should we round up all the ex boyfriends and ex girlfriends who rip up pictures of their exes and burn them and jail them for promoting or apparently engaging in domestic violence the flavor text even says the real thing is illegal this is the softest hearted bs ive ever seen a community of babies be outraged by this is why people hate sjw culture because it lowers the bar constantly on what we should be angry about and most people just arent angry we are more angry that you want us so badly to care about non issues when we are adults with actual problems to worry about
wow,removed,notmytrainingdummy
wow,removed,the first sentence im going to write might sound really controversial but bear with me men and women are not equal thats not to say one is superior than the other they are just different and thats okay it should be celebrated even rather than trying to homogenize humanity into the same pigeon hole the average man is much much stronger than the average female so of course when it comes to violence its much worse for a man to hit a woman than it is for a woman to hit a man im not saying the latter is okay but there is a disparity im sure there are examples where its worse for a woman to do something than a man the sexes both have particular skillsabilities that are better than the other so why not embrace that treating both sexes the same is just treating them both worse than they could be treated everyone is so worried about offending others that they have to treat everyone the same so theres no recourse dont treat people the same just dont be a dick thats all back on topic i really have no problem with that punching bag thing i think its way over sensitive for that guy to be worried about it he may have had a situation pertaining to him where he may have been beaten by a woman which caused the upset no laughing matter nor is it okay however everyone has their own things that might trigger for lack of a better word them personally but if you censored everything that offends anyone wed have no media left offence is taken not given and you can be offended about anything it doesnt make it wrong
wow,removed,wow lfr and normal raiding must be super fun gl getting into mythics plaiyng like a sub optimal retard
wow,removed,its an assumption i agree but expecting to be alive and waking up in the morning is about an equally safe one as assuming that a gender reversal in this case would cause a never before seen kinda shitstorm seeing how less problematic things have been brought up in front of actual politicians before
wow,removed,i tried to post the madseasonshow video tutorial of this from youtube but because reddit is such a censored shitty website it wouldnt let me does anyone else feel its time for a new website when we cant even fucking post youtube videos to help other people its time to jump ship just like digg
wow,removed,maybe we can organize a cry in to get this changed
wow,removed,you think ive never died ive had plenty of shit runbacks they should fix the graveyard thing but running back is punishment for dying death shouldnt be inconsequential im not on some high horse im just not a fucking child who desires no consequences for mistakes
wow,removed,fuck off its a fun toy in a game does killing humans in bgs also make you want to become a mass murderer irl what they need to do is add a ex girlfriend summoner toy with a accompanying rape emote as a nice fuck you to sjws like you
wow,removed,you sound like a retarded robot stuck in a loop
wow,removed,oh a tetarded robot with a little personality i didnt know if you could break the loop of confusion but what happens if he leaves
wow,removed,so you admited killing is okay in a virtual game jokes are not thanks lil sjw d
wow,removed,take hey reddit stop censoring me you stupid shitty website dont block urls and post for those of us trying to help others i cant wait until this shitty website dies
wow,removed,lol we all saw what you were trying to say and they answered it and you kept asking it like a broken piece of equipment youre getting upset just relax or youll get stuck in another loops
wow,removed,yea me and all the other people have reading comprehension problems it couldnt that you are the one with the issue
wow,removed,the list says draenor dungeons too so i guess its just a bug
wow,removed,psa to people who bot dont use public profiles and you will be sweet
wow,removed,go back to league kid
wow,removed,it is not glorification its a joke there is a difference and we should not go down this path
wow,removed,cmon now its just a dummy
wow,removed,meme has apparently become synonymous with joke just like how troll lost all previous meaning now a troll is just someone you disagree with
wow,removed,where do i go for these whine posts
wow,removed,aw thats adorable no fuck off you dip shit sjw go to rpolitics where you belong dont bring that cry baby bullshit into this game
wow,removed,the priest name in that post is sycorax from moknathal realm
wow,removed,eh people may have different views on botting but that is a undeniable piece of advice
wow,removed,your stupidity is astounding these devs suck i can do a way better job of balancing so instead of offering constructive criticism they can use thus improving the overall balance im going to rage about the devs like a year old child on reddit i lold
wow,removed,oh wow a ban threat for giving advice im quaking in my boots o great moderator
wow,removed,except like if you actually think that youre a fucking retard
wow,removed,its november all over again
wow,removed,devils advocate shut the fuck up
wow,removed,you post in rthedonald yet youre acting like the whiniest of sjws
wow,removed,itt waaaaaahhhhhhh
wow,removed,hunters are liberals confirmed
wow,removed,you taught me good how about we hop in discord tonight and i hear which one of us sounds more like the whiney bitching one im thinking its probably gonna be the one that writes a structured angry response like the one above lool
wow,removed,but rainman was still a retard hence the insult
wow,removed,maybe because they had so much time in between wod they mightve been working on something else like legacy servers puts on tinfoil hat
wow,removed,wow such a long shitfilled post almost every aspect of every detail of this post is just flat out wrong makes me sick knowing cucks like this think they know how to balance a game fucking pathetic
wow,removed,i dont care about subreddit witchhunt ill call him out suchmonkwow sells ingame stuff for real life and viewbots to a ridiculous degree i report him once a week or so especially when he gets to or on wows most viewed twitch streams i dont get how he has lasted this long twitch obviously knows he view bots because they havent partnered him when he is regularly pulling views he isnt even covert about it go in his non moving chat and ask how much a carry is and he will openly type out without hesitation
wow,removed,how fat are you you have amazing tits
wow,removed,aryan
wow,removed,never played in beta even when invited pointless and ruins the game its okay though i dont give a shit about others that play it they can help fix the game for me
wow,removed,idgaf what a hard service lul
wow,removed,you seem triggered you mad neckbeard
wow,removed,wow you got me wow player insults are
wow,removed,remind me not to bother actually wasting my time to actually engage then if thats the only response you can muster i typed all that on mobile too christ
wow,removed,youre wrong about the chests and a retard for thinking its staged the guy is just a douchebag bitching about new legendaries like a jerk off
wow,removed,illidan is such a cuck lmao
wow,removed,use exploits at your own risk i think the void storage exploit is still live if you put items in void storage it deletes the metadata and when you take them out of void storage your artifact power will apply use exploits at your own risk
wow,removed,i plan on having all classes to in less than two months now keeping them competitive is not possible what will be possible is doing a few world quests on what i need eg maybe gold im thinking of swapping from dh to monk so we have a healer god fucking cunt eating dammit do i miss double jump and glide so much ive already jumped off a ledge to my death once cussing every second the way down cry oh i can just dismount and double jumpglide for extra height to get over that instead of taking the annoyingly long path to get there
wow,removed,haha itll take more than a few days
wow,removed,probably your fault casual for not being quick enough or knowing the route you didnt even tell reddit what dungeon it was please dont tank if you cant even tank a normal without coming to reddit and complaining you casual
wow,removed,ah ok thanks
wow,removed,i also want it to be known that i do all of my own math i do not use sims i do not trust amrs sims not that i have a grudge against them do you even understand that a sim is effectively rapidly iterated math simcraft is a fully customizable scripting platform that can be used to test whatever setups and variables you desire with sufficient interations to be considered reliable a computer can do more math in seconds than you can do in your whole life your napkin math is literally just a really bad and unreliable version of what you can do if you understood simcraft how can you call yourself a respectable theorycrafter without understanding that im so glad you dont theorycraft for the class i play you need to seriously wake up and rethink your methodology
wow,removed,no sex changes on us servers with a republican becoming president sorry
wow,removed,a legion of autistics
wow,removed,just remove the entire pvepvp server separation altogether and instead make pvp flagging have a week cd no thats exactly what was said clearly didnt read what was written

wow,removed,what youre doing something massively wrong we did with these affixes with deaths of a dd you cant die as a tank unless you misplay or never kite in case its even necessary
wow,removed,gay setup from pandaria still works mechanical pandaren dragonling
wow,removed,toon is literally only used by moutbreathing retards
wow,removed,so you abomraped him triggered
wow,removed,serenity windows just download the weakauras that does to hard part for you and press serenity when the button is green you might need to wait a few seconds to make sure everything fits inside but again the weakauras does all of the thinking for you thinking gcds ahead isnt any different to any other builder spender class though is it like having the resources ready to go when an ability comes up isnt unique to windwalker is it anyways my percentile kills are my bad parses that is also with the legendary ring equipped which inflated my ilvl up a few breachers like brackets while being at best a side grade at worse a dps loss last week i got the legendary cloak dropped the ring and have been parsing at about percentile since it also doesnt help that my guild is still progressing through en so we dont really have the gear to stomp the fights so kill times are longer than many of the people at the top
wow,removed,did you seriously remake this post keep it to the darkspear forums
wow,removed,the android app doesnt seem to work with regards to notifications hasnt worked pretty much since it came out when i got an iphone as a work phone i was surprised the first time it gave me a notification
wow,removed,are immediately met with a barrage of harassment and personal attacks that sounds vaguely familiar with of your posts im more disappointed that we have social rejects with minimal experience who feel its their place to come and bash people daily while making all his claims on the false premise that tanking sims are accurate
wow,removed,i guess the new dance studio is a pvp zone
wow,removed,fuck you
wow,removed,they want to jew you forcing you to give them another a month
wow,removed,aww are you sad people posted your pathetic workaround for a pathetic payoff before you did are you even sadder you forgot theres a lotto search bar up there where people can find the same tutorial but with less clickbait poor you

wow,removed,so near the warden isles i found an excalibur maybe it has something to do with it if anyone want to check it out its here its near a giant rock reaching out of the sea
wow,removed,heres a story i wrote after leading my guild through an early clear of blackwing descent a few weeks into cataclysm nbsp nbsp the amazingly bad race nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspour first week of legitimately trying to kill nef and i say legitimately because our raids typically consist of a debate match between a kid with down syndrome and a kid who thinks that jelly beans grow jelly trees we were in embattled in a time trial of sorts there is a rival guild on our server and rival only because the name light brigade sounds like a gi joe version of broke back mountain which we assumed was also working on their first nef kill since they are keep in mind we know nothing of this guild but were determined to beat them for no reason other than winning our meaningless footrace nbsp nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspwe arrive at nef passed our scheduled start time keeping in line with tbsh tradition by fucking up even the most simplest of things and proceed to dig in for what we all secretly hoped would be a freak first attempt kill however i had a feeling in the back of my mind that nef would soon be brewing his morning coffee with our collective tears the reason i bring that up is because of our holy paladin who is a special child amongst retards insists that nef is easier than alakir although we manage to fuck up beyond belief every time we fight him too so based on that tidbit the word easy is directly correlated with the speakers level of denialretardation about said boss lets just say that if alakir were real life and those tornadoes were city busses the world would be rid of at least miserable souls with the situational awareness of a fat kid eating chocolate cake nbsp nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspwe go over the strategy a couple of times and assign people to pillars for interrupts in typical tbsh fashion the only question after we are done reviewing and assigning is what pillar am i on again our future in the face of a zombie onyxia and pissed of nef looks veryconfused to say the least we buff up eat our food pop our flasks and jump into the arena to face what im sure is instantaneous death by face punch circus of morons nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspphase one goes smoothly and our mildly retarded dps manage to get nef down to before onyxia goes down to begin phase two the adds were also perfectly placed by our propaladininblues which in theory should make phase three an easy transition phase two starts and people are swimmingburning to death in a mad race to get on their correct pillars before nef one shots a respective amount of the raid with his fiery balls of bullshit most of us manage to get onto our pillars in a timely fashion except our huntard who manages to rack of a lovely stacks of lava after a quick panic from our superspecialholypaladin consisting of interupt your fucking blast waves you fucking morons ie nonmouse using paladin tank we get phase two rolling and hope that our tanks who are supposed to do nothing but interrupt dont suddenly forgettony it has happened before because if you havent noticed the status quo of tbsh is to find a way to fuck everything up at least once phase two goes of without a hitch and for those of you who have done nef before thats when the real fight starts nbsp nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspour canadian death knight who has no obvious deficiencies other than being canadian and standing in fire for very long periods of time picks up nef and proceeds to take him to the far wall of the arena meanwhile our paladin tank of equally terrible skill runs to the other side of the arena with all the adds in tow now since our fine members of tbsh fail at almost every undertaking we actually use two tanks for adds the second tank just happens to be an alt of a very misunderstood and confused warlock which was referred to earlier as the propaladininblues hand in hand the paladin duo take off with the adds with a very pissed of resto shaman chasing behind who is only angry for the fact that either one of the paladins like to run adds through fire to stack the buff well into the thirties which basically means that healing is next to impossible and the tanks die a horrible painful and completely avoidable deathhes also angry because he sounds like the country guy from fast and the furious tokyo drift after we are all set we push nef passed and begin the blindfolded dps race that is phase three for whatever reason going against a typical tbsh boss fight the fight runs smoothly till about taunt tardation nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspat this point the calm and sense of determination that has settled over the raid in the last quickly evaporates when an add comes stampeding into the raid group almost on cue the add tanks make a beeline for the raid group just as nef is throwing down a shadow flame for those of you that dont know shadow flame is just like your ordinary fire which our death knight tank is very adept at standing in except it follows you it follows you like a homeless man asking for change it follows you so much that it will follow you to your car and wash your windows until you give it a dollar much like that homeless man does thats how serious this fire follows you since our genius paladin twins decided to run to the raid to get the add rather than taunting it the fire is no long in the middle of the arena where it should be the fire is now directly under our main tank and standing in line with his canadian tanking tradition he proceeds to stand in it at our hopes are nerfed to the ground when crackle goes off our death knight tank dies as nef stomps around untanked i think a dps or two goes down but during the cluster fuck that phase three turned into i was just trying not to stand in fire so i am not sure what is going on but then again i am never whats going on so that last sentence is just pointless the only thing for certain was that we needed a miracle we needed jesus jesus in maryland nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspwhat we got was holycanolis holycanolis was the warlock turned propaladininblues for our nef attempt the expectation of this paladin was that he was going to help stun the adds and pick up stragglers now nobody would have ever let him tank nef considering he probably shouldnt even tank a heroic but there he was propaladininblues locked in an epic struggle against the last normal raid boss in wow nobody told him to nobody asked him to he just did it at this point there roughly people left alive only one of those was a healer that number quickly dropped to it dropped to because the other half of the paladin duo had adds with stacks ranging in the s beating the living shit out of him while he begged for heals keep in mind that the adds are never ever under any circumstances supposed to gain that many stacks but considering the fact that our mtadd tank paladin doesnt use a mouse to play wow which is like mozart using a kazoo instead of a piano the adds can and always will gain an ungodly number of stacks the little paladin who couldnt nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspby this time if memory serves me right there were only people left alive at this point myself propaladininblues special child paladin healer and an enhancement shaman that clicks almost everything he uses i know it sounds absolutely ridiculous to bring a clicker to a raid but this is the best god damned clicker i have ever played with this shaman clicks harder than you could ever mash your keyboard if will smith and jeff goldblum had to click to upload that virus into the mothership at the end of the movie independence day not only would they have done it and beat the alien bastards but they would have done it faster thats how good this shaman can click we proceed to go push through to which means another world shattering crackle goes off and in a fury of sweat and tears we push that last as hard as we possibly can adds are beating on our propaladininblues as well as nef he cant hold on much longer and i cant cast fireballs any faster than i already am at some point between and our healer dies i would like to think that he died because he is in the habit of spamming super heals until he goes oom after which he proceeds to scream at other healers in vent because they arent healing hard enough i dont understand healing at all but i guess thats the way it works with that being said im sure he pulled aggro from one of the adds and was sliced up to be served as an appetizer at the nef and onyxia reunion party as soon as we wipe we hit another major milestone on the road from to death when our propaladininblues drops dead he drops dead at
wow,removed,i run with elitist people who always run the best or dont tolerate failure much for our little group we dont really give a shit what your dps is like so long as you do mechanics we also take ranged over melee because theres so much fucking melee this expansion its ridiculous the people that get kicked or denied despite good ilvl are being kicked or denied by fucking retards literally the lowest common denominator that plays this game i suppose that apparently thats a lot of people out there if suggest making friends and utilizing your guild you probably dont want to play with those terribads anyway
wow,removed,thats not accurate at all yes from from ap from ap also with artifact research gained every daysand progressively shorter as time goes on your statement is entirely wrong
wow,removed,httpswwwredditcomrwowwikirules disallowed posts the following posts are not allowed and will be removed sell me on wow

wow,removed,i dont think a shorter cooldown on wraithwalk would be that big of an issue melee dps needs to get to the mobs quick to do damage but when most of the other melee dpstanks have more mobility it leaves you kind of running behind they did put in a few things that help and im hoping eventually ill get those haste to movement speed boots but i still just wish the cooldown on ww was shorter or had charges or something
wow,removed,get the hell out of my threads you fucking nolife

wow,removed,just gonna leave this here if anyone happened to have multiple codes and felt like sharing it would be much appreciated
wow,removed,yeah that guys a retard
wow,removed,hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhhahahhahhahhahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahwhwhwhahahwhwhwhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahaha
wow,removed,hahahaha nice one dude ahahahahah
wow,removed,lmao
wow,removed,the cringe is strong with this one
wow,removed,dps tier list for the beta dog shit has more uses than a dps tier list for the beta
wow,removed,fucking illiterate
wow,removed,no eu movie code as far as i know
wow,removed,i have an extra us code to that i would love to trade for an eu code as my guild leaders had to move back to the netherlands and would love to play with them
wow,removed,i still got a eu code pm me and ill give it to you
wow,removed,piggybacking on this request because i need one too appreciate anyone with an extra thanks
wow,removed,now i want to force him to crossdress tie him up and pound his boipucci
wow,removed,yup most raid leaders are piece of shits
wow,removed,i dont give a crap about your opinion i just signed up for a raid last week and after he declined me without a reason and i asked him why not he just told me because you stink yeah really funny seems like wows community is on the same iq level as twitch chat bunch of year old btw i dont give a shit about downvotes either
wow,removed,holy fuck checkov died
wow,removed,this is not a shit post i thought reddit welcomed sjws this is way less ridiculous than the ideas they usually come up
wow,removed,so has blizzard been overrun by sjws
wow,removed,its probably because youre gay
wow,removed,youre clearly new to this debating thing not once did you accurately look at what i said and ecen try to address the issue you simply claim im wrong and worst part is you dont even say why you just use ad hominem to claim that your expertise is better because mythic when in reality mythic isnt some high plateau for someone like me you would realise this if you looked at my armory for just a moment just look at your last answer i never said it was a rewarding spec infact a few posts above i called it the copout spec and it is high apm dont bother responding with answers this argument no longer interests me as a year spriest main i know what is best for my class but mark my words spriest is going to suffer and suffer hard when it comes to late tier content due to its button mashing high intensity and immobile nature
wow,removed,no just gay
wow,removed,yes well enjoy being blizzards cuck
wow,removed,off topic but its awkward that you used girls as an insult im a dude but i dont invalidate my girls opinion on games just because of her gender ah well carry on
wow,removed,shut the fuck up
wow,removed,there are people who believe that the restriction of speech in any context carries costs and downsides we call those people naive idealists let me know when you want to rejoin the real world where people dont want to hear a bunch of abusive shit in their global chat channels and you can be punished for it because neither does blizzard if people want to run their fucking mouths there are plenty of other places on the internet to do it
wow,removed,pl doesnt work like that fucking retard
wow,removed,thats quite a retarded thing to say
wow,removed,well thats what you get for being a super nerd
wow,removed,commenting to save
wow,removed,saving for later
wow,removed,save my spot here for later please
wow,removed,i will make accounts great again your levels will be huge i make the best auction house deals the goblins will build our garrison walls and pay for them make accounts great again
wow,removed,just give me the account kkthxbye
wow,removed,id love to share this with a friend intimidated by my guild and long time guildees
wow,removed,you may feel this way now but if you ever get free time again or just the urge to play even if its a couple of years from now youre gonna be sad you gave it away i thought about selling my account when i was having my first daughter but now i have free time at night and would have been pretty bummed if i had to start over
wow,removed,sad that you gotta go man i would love to put the account to use as i would like to get my wife to start playing with me she started a trial account and loved it but we dont get heaps of time to play nor the money to boost a bunch of toons with legion looming id love to raid the broken shore with my wife in toe and decimate our foes together good luck at school 😀👍
wow,removed,remindme hours gotta get some of these when i get home from work
wow,removed,

wow,removed,www thebestbuygoldhere susan gov nz
wow,removed,forgot the part where blizzard gutted this spec into oblivion
wow,removed,if youre terrible sure ill help you wwwplayerauctionscom
wow,removed,well im trying to assemble the best raiding team i can i honestly dont think im racist but in the end you have to put together the best group you can it doesnt really matter where theyre from so long as they perform at expectation however i have yet to see a polack since youre so happy to throw that term around be honest you like to emulate honesty but youre so eager to defend the polish that i must assume youre one of them and let me tell you that theres no such thing as an honest polack
wow,removed,thanks a lot im just trying to get a guild up and running i bet youre one of those high caliberdeath and taxesexodus assholes why even bother posting are you so high and mighty nobody cares about you and honestly except for your theorycrafting figures they never have
wow,removed,shhhhhhh
wow,removed,pretends reddit cares about greentext greentext everyone laughs
wow,removed,id recommend you learn to speak and spell english before you come back here you sound just like one of my incidental guildies polack
wow,removed,thanks for reply alex i swapped some gear out and hit the mastery breakpoint little high now will lower for vers and got the darkmoon will run some dungeons tonight and let you know if i notice the changes
wow,removed,we had a cape kid at college that never left his dorm one day we found him reading a wow comic and me being le fâg that i am said you play ended up he played same server as us and joined our guild was a decent healer but we still did our best to not be seen with him so if you need a healer might be worth plugging your nose with hand sanitizer and sayin sup
wow,removed,its not about ethics its about nature of competition since clearly defined rules about what is an exploit and what isnt are hard to do teams are practically forced to abuse any they find in fear of others doing the same for a good example in near history we can look at fnatic boost in csgo if youre not aware fnatic used a boost standing on other players to gain vision boosts are allowed but this one gave them practical invisibility while seeing and being able to shoot practically everywhere in the map
wow,removed,youre all ok with being virgins when youre
wow,removed,best way to get it fixed is by causing chaos
wow,removed,bad design ill stop paying instead
wow,removed,cool story meanwhile you only done lfr
wow,removed,who cares
wow,removed,enjoy lfr
wow,removed,yeah everybody is xx on the internet we are all impressed by your text
wow,removed,yes you are autistic atleast now you can focus on your problem
wow,removed,i got every piece i need from mythic en and i do m a day cache pvp still at leg is that not content
wow,removed,why would i pay for a shitty game that gives lfr heroes a dps item on their alts
wow,removed,yeah game is shit all my toons got only leg including my main
wow,removed,somebody is a lfr cuck i probably farm more ap in a day than you do in a weak lfr kiddie
wow,removed,oh so they have unbenched you know engrish hue
wow,removed,you care enough to reply you dumb cuckmook
wow,removed,consider using better insults good enough for this cuckmook to keep replying with his cuckboi tears
wow,removed,you keep using the term cuck when im not doing anything cuck related typical cuck doesnt know when hes being a cuck would fuck your wife again
wow,removed,i have leg at why would i link
wow,removed,its okay we all feel sorry for your mom too after he train her
wow,removed,tldr cuckmook
wow,removed,im not an rtard
wow,removed,additionally for more relevant comparisons to more recent events a guild did decide to attack the sleeper on a night when there was some exploit in the encounter that made him killable that guild got banned as a result of their actions were coming full circle now baby
wow,removed,this post is cringe as fuck im such nice person i give free portals look i made friends we doin tis dungeon so fun eheheh cringe
wow,removed,theyve been skimping on development since wotlk remember all the recycled dungeons and especially since cataclysm subscribers put up with it for a while but theyve seen their client base steadily erode since then
wow,removed,gay
wow,removed,the codes are only for brand new accounts if you dont have a use for it i would love to use it me and my girlfriend went to an amc theater and i guess the codes were only given out at regal theaters but she got excited from the movie and wants to play now
wow,removed,what are your hobbies i play wow paint and meme around with my brother he doesnt have wow yet though what do you plan to do with the code give it to my little brother who are you madly in love with my family what do you despise when you poop and you look into the toilet and theres nothing there what has been your most unforgettable moment in game or in life just havin a hoot n a holler with the boys on vidya games in general
wow,removed,hell if you want to take unpopular to the next level heres my similar movie thoughts the movie does some things better guldan reviving stillborn thrall was awesome and is going to be so poetic as the series goes on maybe hopefully please i love how his own hubris is sort of what brings about the one who will undo most of the evil that the legion brings upon the orcs garona x lothar while awkward at some points in the portrayal is an awesome and pretty logical pairing that enriches both of them and denies us medan garonas killing of llane is better in the movies hell llane is better in the movies totally noble totally selfsacrificing a bit too much trust in medivh but that works and makes sense taria wrynn is an awesome character kind of a protoanduin in a way i have to admit i was like wow what a lame addition they really wanted a female person of colour didnt they but i just absolutely loved her character and wish she had more screentime durotan is better way better wod started to make him more interesting but the movie just totally upped the ante im still resisting racechanging like all my characters into orcs
wow,removed,medan is a shit character that is the retard baby child of garona and medivh hes a fanfiction self insert and dont count on him ever actually mattering in the real lore
wow,removed,if youve never seen this this is the most bullshit piece of corrupted crap ever if the directors dont like you they make everyone ignore you and hate on you its ridiclous this tournement of ages is complete trash
wow,removed,this is afterall the interwebz
wow,removed,lol hello again good to see youre so buttrekt about my comment
wow,removed,i guess i like anime and cats cuz cats are cute ive been wanting to get into wow for a few years now but never made the decision to go for it until now i guess so i would play the shit out odf this game for the third question filthyfranktv unforgettable moment thats probably doing my first dungeon in tera wich pushed me into the direction of mmo also i can wiggle with the wing of my nose so thats pretty cool but i cant whistle
wow,removed,clearly you care so much that youre replying to my other comments with your mad lol get fuckin rekt
wow,removed,lol you fucking moron get more butthurt because people dont like your video game movie
wow,removed,i know what vanilla was compared to other games like everquest or even lineage ii but most people regard vanilla as the hardcore experience without knowing that the above mentioned games were infinitely harder wow was the game for casuals it always have been
wow,removed,you sound like an angry child who cant understand why the grown ups dont like his shitty movie
wow,removed,tldr vanilla wow hitler mode
wow,removed,a black human in wow that wasnt made as a joke this is new
wow,removed,get a job you loser
wow,removed,discussion of private servers is not allowed on this subreddit also wow is very cheap at the moment
wow,removed,
wow,removed,as a frequent player on moon guard ill give my opinion on the matter here the directors of the event are extremely biased and the clique situation on moon guard is pathetic it is one of the reasons i no longer engage in role play guilds like the highguard arathor etc if they do not like you can ruin your experience on the server its a terrible situation on the other side farquaad is a troll ive had a few conversations with him and other friends of mine talked to him several times as well everyone agrees he is a bit of an asshole at times i have attended this event since its inception and can vouch that the server is corrupted by a clique situation it is not fun to roleplay on moon guard when a group of guilds run the server
wow,removed,how fat is she
wow,removed,i tried calling and they said that they would not deal with this over the phone but only by ticket
wow,removed,if they did there is no way they could have done it from my pc i dont run any servervpn from here so they would have another ip adress i expect blizzard to be able to identify that no
wow,removed,i am very respectful when interacting with others the golden rule i explained that i have no knowledge of this action i dont know what else i can say its very simple im not cheating in this game so i dont know what specifically i should be defending myself against
wow,removed,thank you for the tip friend i will get on that
wow,removed,my computer has a password so that is not possible however i dont own a smartphone so i dont have any authenticator but if this was the case someone figured out my password they would have to log in from elsewhere in which case blizzard should be able to see the different ip address when they logged in no i am also very sceptical to what i download so i am inclined to beleive that i do not have any spyware on my computer because i am careful when exploring the internet i use adblocks ghostery etc im starting a scan right now just to verify using antimalwarebytes
wow,removed,i did the phone thing you have to submit a ticket and they call you back now but the woman in the phone told me that this was never dealt with over the phone only in tickets by another group i explained my situation and she was very understanding afterall i have invested years into this game i think they understand that i really want to get to the bottom of this
wow,removed,i dont know what they do have i submitted a ticket stating that i did not have any knowledge about this because as previously stated i have not cheated in this game if i did hopefully i would have had more ratings during my years as a customer of blizzard i have never really ended up in this situation so im just very surprised at this all and all tips from you guys are really helpful
wow,removed,i did that but the woman on the phone told me that the people on phones does never handle this kind of issue thats solely for another group and they get stuff through tickets not phone
wow,removed,i have never downloaded any development tools or anything like that before i only have skype teamspeak steam origin and battlenet installed on the computer so theres almost no chance some hack was detected
wow,removed,i think your doubt is probably a good thing but it leaves me at the same place as i was before if i could get a reply from blizzard on what exactly they think i did it would be a lot easier to relate to this but since they are very vague it is hard to understand i am left with the email from blizzard saying that i did these two things and they dont even really describe what i did this is why im turning to reddit to get tips or ideas on where i can go next who i can contact i dont think blizzard will read this reddit post and think shit this guy got banned in our automated systems and he is clearly innocent we must unban him at once
wow,removed,i dont got banned for botting i got banned for account sharing and exploting game mechanics
wow,removed,i havent downloaded a bot beforebecause i only do pvp on about characters so i dont really have expenses ingame but the reasons stated was acc sharing and exploitation
wow,removed,i dont use the same password elsewhere and it has a lot of digits but dont you think the people who reviewed the ban would take this into account when making the decision ie that if someone else had my details they would be in another corner of the world
wow,removed,thanks for the moral support friend my next action will be to make a thread on the customer support forums and see what comes of it i greatly appreciate all tips and ideas
wow,removed,so uh whats the safest or least buggy site to buy gold from now inbox me asking for a uh friend yeah
wow,removed,when it also comes in a time when the new expansion is right around the corner which i have already paid for i am just left really puzzled it essentially means i dont get to try the expansion before way late and since all i do is pvp this means that i will be months behind other players in terms of gear very punishing for pvp but the biggest issue here is that i havent shared my account i have never willingly given my password to anyone and to the best of my knowledge nobody has ever logged in i dont have access to logs like blizzard do so when they slap this action on me and i dont know why when or if it at all has happened i have no idea what i can do about it when i also hear that a lot of other people has been affected by it too and i can read a post stating that an automated system banned people who are not suppose to be banned i just get very frustrated and dissapointed i have been a customer for years with blizzard and now an automated system just made me unable to experience the new expansion until months into its release very frustrating
wow,removed,thanks for the tip friend
wow,removed,i logged into a new account and it looks like my achievement and mounts are saved on the entire account but its still very poor from blizzard that this kind of thing can happen thanks for the tips
wow,removed,im able to get into quests lower than my level im currently using the lfd interface and these dungeons normally disappears as i level up but theres some quests achievements and mounts rivendares deathcharger id like to go after no of course nots what an idiotic question
wow,removed,i think my wording here might have been unfortunate i am not a native english speaker so i am trying my best the point is that i havent found a bug and then used it however i have experienced things that are buggy and probably not suppose to work the way they currently do prime example when i do ashran weekly quest events boss if i leave the boss for last i get boss already killed when i auto complete my weekly quest and accept the repeatable quest for conquest points so even if i only kill the boss time i get it tagged as complete on the weekly quest the new quest i get after that this is the kind of example i am trying to refer to when i put it in words the way i did i am sorry that it was not entirely clear from the start
wow,removed,i am just trying to get some help or pointers on what to go next and for no apparent reason some of the people here are attacking me for using bots and i have no idea why i guess this is reddit
wow,removed,i suppose this is the obvious thing i will have to do in the bigger picture if i get the money back i can buy wow over again and play with everyone else from the start of the expansion it is just very strange that this seemingly automated system decided to ban me like this and from the looks of it some of the blizzard customer support people are aware that their system has gone a little bit overboard high profile players like cdew got unbanned within hours but i dont have the same public profile he does so i can not enlist several thousand twitter followers to help me however i really appreciate all the tips and pointers i am getting from you guys right here right now and it really does help me figure our how i can deal with this i was just surprised and had no idea what to do at first but now ive got a forum thread going and ill try to get a refund like you said if the forum thread doesnt pan out
wow,removed,it stings when its this close to the expansion release essentially they are forcing me to either start months after everyone else or buy the game over again waiting months is not really acceptable since i only do pvp so my gear being that far behind is going to really mess with my ability to compete i am just very frustrated and dissapointed in blizzard right now
wow,removed,forum post a mvp has replied and writes that appeals should only go through tickets same info i get over the phone i guess a more final answer will come of it should a blizzard employee reply to the thread
wow,removed,i only play pvp and in terms of gear we will all start from scratch once the next expansion is released i guess it is not the end of the world when i think about it but i am just very surprised that it is this easy for them to allow the automated system to temporarily disable anyones account
wow,removed,the thing is im terrified because i havent actually done anything so this basically opened the door right in my face on the chance of always getting my account removed without actually doing anything to put myself in risk of that i know its just a game but i have really enjoyed this game for a long time and i hope to continue enjoying it but this changes my ability to trust the people behind the game
wow,removed,on the blizzard store i only find one for use on american accounts
wow,removed,yep thanks for the hint i wanted to make sure i had exhausted all my options before going down that road
wow,removed,thanks for the link at least one of those are stores near where i live so ill check it out never really figured those kind of places would sell them figured it was only a phone app and the pure authenticators being labeled with country was limited to countries
wow,removed,thanks for the moral support friend ive gotten a handful of ideas from this thread and i am already seeing what i can get done on customer support forums
wow,removed,i have yes but from my understanding those are both south american servers
wow,removed,theyre brazilian servers players from there tend to be of a lower quality unable to communicate are horrible at their classes and are so stuck up that they wont listen to advice even if they can understand you ive hated the fact that they merged the br servers into the us servers lfdlfr systems i used to give them the benefit of the doubt hey the game just came out down there possibly they dont know any better after years sorry but they really are just a bunch of assholes id rather be in a group filled with illidan players than more than br player
wow,removed,i referenced this in the original post
wow,removed,i was not around for the sick dps boost bug i only play a few days per week i have been affected by exploitsglitches like the ashran weekly conquest quest doing a double dip on the boss kill when you leave that as the last part did i plan for that to happen no but its not like i minded the fact that i was getting conquest points a tad bit easier stuff like this is spread around the game if you played ashran months ago you might also recall some bug where you could have multiple events go on at the same time im not causing these things but im not trying to give myself an unfair position by using them either
wow,removed,if harambe 🐒 and my girl 👧 😍 both drowning 😱 👋 and i can only save one 😤 😬 catch me at my girl funeral 😔 👻 🌹 with my dick out 😏 💯 😎 🍆 this is a bot pm new harambes and suggestions pls 🙏 harambeworld 🌎🌍🌏
wow,removed,i feel like blizzard knows about this soda even said in your second link there the guy told him something like it never not happened when i was an orc so it only happens on orcs clearly not intended and the fact its on the beta client isnt a cause for alarm
wow,removed,yeah cross out your ingame names but not your reddit name its the same thing a pseudonym geezus
wow,removed,blizz will take care of it all they will roll you back refund the money and send your toon back to its rightful server dont sweat it ive been hacked times over the last almost years not once since they added the authenticatior app each time blizz handled it very well except for the first time when they totally screwed me and perma banned my account for botting fuck you gm coldiotir thats right i still remember your name you fascist fuck
wow,removed,dont remind me im sick of blizzard taking things like this away from us what a bunch of fucking assholes i want to be able to craft them on my new engineer
wow,removed,lol another empty response from the idiot who thought boycotting the event by vendoring gear was a legit move i love how you say shit with no grounds and pretend to have the upper hand keep acting butthurt over personal attacks thatll help your side of the argument its funny considering you were the first one to make a condescending remark regarding my position on this matter then proceeded to play the bullied victim once i called you a dumbass and resorted to being a sjw when its completely irrelevant btw dont bring up issues like that when you dont even know what entails homophobia or bigotry and as fucking hypocritical as the last reply made you regarding personal attacks the funniest part is that you expect other people to do background reading on your reddit history before replying to your dickish comments get over yourself i dont give a fuck about your history you are vehemently defending this event that blizzard admittedly executed poorly which is the core of this discussion i came to this post first to just state the opposite side of the coin regarding this event as the series of hotfixes produced its fair share of flaws amidst the event that i too had been enjoying i ended up accidentally caught up with an illiterate condescending little kid lol read please and think before believing you understand or actually have a point if youd kindly look back on all your replies to me youd realize that you didnt actually say shit all except the fact you felt personally attacked and otherwise been grasping at straws to make me appear like a bigot lol not that i expect much selfreflection from your pompous self especially looking at the recent comment
wow,removed,youre a bit of an idiot arent ya
wow,removed,step get to the crossroads azshara or tarrenmill invasions tarrenmill is actually the worst one u can go to but if u dont have the other two thats the best one step get a group to repeat the stage and stage step tag as many mobs as possible step enter the inkeeper to logout faster or run into orgrimmars gate only for azshara step repeat it took me a bit more than because its the worst possible invasion to repeat tarrenmills one the other two are more efficient since the mobs spawn really close to each other enjoy
wow,removed,still waiting for the day blizzard changes its policy in the meantime j will continue to gank people like you and watch them squeal
wow,removed,lel theres actually a exploit related to getting people to auto flag been farming scrubs like op all week
wow,removed,then maybe they shouldnt be playing a public game where anyone can connect and see the names jesus what a fucking weirdo whats going to happen theyre going to get harassed well in wow you can get suspended but on reddit i can send you a pm anytime i want and make infinite accounts and harass you for years and you cant do jack squat so its fucking weird ass to cross out names in screenshots
wow,removed,disableupdate addons
wow,removed,the one outside iron forge has an inn to reset and highly recommended heirlooms upgraded max for xp

wow,removed,ive only seen it at invasions in the barrens
wow,removed,is it still not castable while moving
wow,removed,voljin is a strategist but hes done enough killing on the front lines to be on a first name basis with bwonsamdi theres a lot of evidence in the novels that voljin has a ton of experience on the front lines also thrall lorethemar and sylvanas all fought in the third war something only jaina participated in on the alliance side not to mention sylvanas had hundreds of years of experience as a battlefield commander as the rangergeneral of quelthalas which means that dat booty queen as you say is the only one to have commanded troops as a general for both the alliance and the horde as well as being the only one to have a commanding officer role during all wars when it comes to commanding officers the alliance are children compared to the wealth of battlefield experience still left on the horde side on top of all that alliance leaders are notorious for giving up and leaving their allies to be slaughtered varian and greymane ditched lodaeron and quelthalas during the third war and greymane ditched lodaeron in the second war velen hand selected which of his people would be slaughtered while the rest of them went into hiding during the draenor war hightinker lost his kingdom in a coup to diseased rebels and tyrande has hidden away from conflict fluffing the pillows of her sleeping druids for thousands of years horde leaders might get their shit kicked and die but at least theyre not pussies
wow,removed,ah yes the draenigger skin colour as it were
wow,removed,thats pretty hilarious i always thought their movement was random

wow,removed,are you stupid i was asking if he was even soloable and if so how do i do it with my low gear just fuck off
wow,removed,oh im sad now
wow,removed,hunters are epic dps at which should help you get into raiding guilds
wow,removed,its like that death knights too probably worse start off aiding arthas in his attack of the argent crusade then sent off to stormwind or orgrimmar where bolvar and thrall are nowhere to be seen and the factions are now being led by a much older anduin and voljin off to outland for no reason and then to northrend where the king of the alliance is a recently deceased varian and garrosh hellscream who you mightve heard was a huge problem recently is leading the horde expedition then back to azeroth where the demons are no longer an issue and instead some cultists are the problem then to pandaria where is suddenly becomes clear why that guy garrosh gets talked about a lot in harsh tones finally youre all caught up varian and voljin die and youre back to present times which is where you were when you were going to the kingwarchief to offer the alligence of the death knights in the first place
wow,removed,you might be secretly chinese have you been farming a lot of gold lately frequenting internet cafes
wow,removed,fuckin an hero you emo
wow,removed,unbelievable how damn toxic people are here pouring my heart out about something i didnt choose to have and how this change is going to affect me and apparently i made up a life impairing condition this was for me a last option in the hope for blizzard to see this i have no na account to post on and have no acces to legion beta forums they are in fact active on this reddit and read posts from people what i get from random people is nothing but hate over nothing just awesome well done be proud of yourselves yeee internet warriors seriously disgusting hope for you people you never have to experience anything like this in your life something that prevents you to have a normal existence have a nice day and i hope you get treated better in your daily life then you show others hiding behind your screens
wow,removed,yes they are just browsing reddit waiting on poor pitiful people like you to complain so they can change their own development genius how could i not have known that oh wait they dont i dont care if it was or wasnt aimed at me i just told you straight up that youre not goin to get sympathy here
wow,removed,retard
wow,removed,the way you type makes it undesirable to be near you let alone do an entire gold cm set are you bis even progressed to bis you just seem like you want a free carry
wow,removed,id report this to the police
wow,removed,you are just so elitist lol i am playing wow from months ago theres people that has no idea about the game kid
wow,removed,im going to be starting a new eu account soon to play with my old guild leaders who had to move back to the netherlands they sadly arent on the same server as you but if you would want to roll new characters on their server i would more than be happy to play with you and help in any way ive been playing wow since beta and have raided in every expansion im just on a break now because of the lack of content fell free to message me for bnet tag
wow,removed,typical french running away from confrontation by going offline suits you you baguette motherfucker s
wow,removed,why would you infer someone elses immersion to stem from your own camera distance truly stupid and idiotic and a lack of comprehension to boot id suggest playing in traffic sometime
wow,removed,no you need to realise that all hardcore raiders dont share the same opinion consider his argument on how competitive players dont really have a choice in camera distance because they are expected to perform on a level that is based on the information that the maximum camera distance provides that does not mean that they all prefer playing the game at that distance
wow,removed,alot of dust out there jokes apart sure there´s still a fog wall i think it would be overkill if they increase it more take a look at a alternative for the fog wall could be a depth of field option but i dont know if the wow engine can handle this
wow,removed,ok blizz i know youre making so many improvements but what we all really want is longer toenails on female trolls its been annoying me for ages how short they are
wow,removed,jainas gonna blow up the cathedral of light and anduin is going to take a dive off the balcony to stormwind castle and end it all
wow,removed,thats how the boost works you are given your spells slowly
wow,removed,i could say the same thing about you but everyone knows your mum was at least before she whored herself out and had you
wow,removed,who says were not good enough has your year old ass considered that maybe i dont have the time to do the same raid twice or thrice a week im already playing a ton i dont need another night added in there this isnt wod where you didnt have anything fun to do outside of your main raid
wow,removed,whatever fanboy im sure hes happy that you tell people what he needs to do
wow,removed,please for the love of god httpswwwtakeascreenshotorg
wow,removed,for the first example a prime example of forced garbage collection out of cycle or between cycles is when elvui gets confused onnbag sorting sometimes it will pop an arraytable then combat will start since the objects cant move and the array cant sort the function fails your array is still loaded on complete combat the update yo is fired if you died your array is still populated and now you have a function which failed when you ressurect or you drop combat your bag will not auto sort hitting sort again to re continue reloads the array the array is cleared using a garbage collection function to drop the cache of the search system because the search system uses the array thats no longer valid the purpose of garbage collection is absolutely to reduce or remove unused space that is being loaded in the memory im addon space non programming experienced addon authors are nice and overstep frame strata because they feel they are the only ones to make a frame called myframe or initializing multiple frames and temp variables because of overlapping addon spaces its super simple to prevent addon cross communication or lua errors by unregistering your frame sadly no one does this when they are new thanks fully i can pop garbage collection and force it to run and clear it before i do anything which may interact with my frames forcing gc is a tool to be used not abused doing high end calculations and leaving larges arbitration and dummy data can cause issues with the ui why wait for the shitty api and lua implementation to finally gc when i can force it and remove the trash left over data during the battlenet mesh network days with populating cross realm groups using the battlenet real id and having it places notes gc not being forced would cause nearly gb of data per minutes or on frame close we can force a raw dump of dead expired data
wow,removed,they dont get days of free game time from you rafing them it already comes when they purchase the game and as far as i know they dont get a discount for the game either anyone can get that try harder to be a scum
wow,removed,not quite as much as the type of asshole who still uses you must be fun at parties though if my behaviour steers dipshits like you away from me im doing everything correctly
wow,removed,well you too then the kind of idiots running around here is really quite amazing
wow,removed,about as useful as giving a college textbook to a black person
wow,removed,thats not on cooldown and not the reason its being cast frequently later in the fight youre beyond help its clear now why youre shit
wow,removed,wtf hahahhahahahahahaha
wow,removed,i like that it is not over the top whorey looking good job
wow,removed,so basically youre just a moron for bitching about it then its your fault for doing the inefficient thing there is no reason not to take the literal to minutes it takes to do a cache youre just being a twat
wow,removed,what theyre not designing a mechanic they are changing variables in a code string all you have to do is apply that code algorithm to a database reader with the new numbers and you should get a baseline dps for any spec youre changing then some simple insystem testing to make sure nothing is broken and youre good to go let it ride on the ptr for a day or two just to triple check and youre ready for live if youre a developer that doesnt know how to check algorithm values after a simple variable change then you must not be a very good one but what do i know am just not a fucking retard
wow,removed,if any of you retards puts poison on the bridge one more time they are getting gkicked for being such an inbreed
wow,removed,neat tattoo fit legs from running still a filthy foreigner would not bang

wow,removed,so ive seen far worse jokes upvoted in this community and far better jokes downvoted that doesnt mean that yall get to pm me and telling me to shut the fuck up jeez whatever happened to someone sharing a joke maybe even a bad one and not getting absolutely judged and destroyed by it i thought the idea of something so small and so obviously broken escaping blizz devs radar was slightly hilarious well we gotta make sure the pyroblast does x legendaries do y can you run the numbers real quick and make sure everything is tidy and set im reading a repeating of success and numbers are fine boss but take a look at this apparently flame patch is tuned too high and fire mages are now forced to flame strike on st well thats an easy fix we should defi nah forget it its not a priority wait till
wow,removed,hey mom i got a tattoo to post it on reddit for my friends to see i hope i get many upvotes xdddd fuck off
wow,removed,i think the reason most people are upset myself included is because there is no reason for these patch notes to be delayed so much you have absolutely no possible way of knowing that you entitled twat
wow,removed,what the fuck thats like ultimate cuckoldry the guy should khs
wow,removed,are you retarded

wow,removed,man i bet it would have been hard to type the exact title into google you tard
wow,removed,are you slow do you not understand that devs have said this every expansion since the launch of vanilla do you not understand simulations or logs there has been and will never be parity among all dps specs you look like an idiot posting a dev qa the question was is frost or unholy better moron unholy is miles ahead its people like you that ruin this game for new players spreading blatantly untrue lies do your research noob im done with you
wow,removed,asking if your friend is a mental retard should be a considerable question i remember when guild master of my guild sold at least worth drake mount for like and i bought it after that i got kicked for calling him a moron in front of his friends good times

wow,removed,and legacy will never cut it going back to the archaic periods of wow is an absolutely hypocritical and idiotic idea and if you actually had fucking brain cells youd see that legion is offering more feature and improved features than any expansion in the history of wow its clear that you are a legacy fanboy and you have no place on a wow reddit you really are a disgrace and the downvotes youve received are not suprising but much deserving

wow,removed,remindme days check app store
wow,removed,spoilers ahead i guess i am in a minority here since people seem to love most of the lore and story stuff so far but i fucking hated the story in legion so far especially the druid zone i get the kill important characters stuff really ok if it is done well but i dont feel they do it good at all voljin died completely random half of screen yeah we burn him later but his end seemed so unimportant varian gave me the same feeling yeah he saved the ship but why not let him fucking scratch guldan at least just hit him in the face once or something taking the big demonrobotthing down just to be stabed to death by the trashies felt so weak and the druid zone made me want to throw stuff at my screen ysera gets fucking corrupted by some shit man boss then bashed to death by my questing char for some greens yeah i get the tear and all but again it felt so fucking thrown out it feels like they are just burning through their characters at the moment and building characters people eventually like and get into takes time kill them off it you have to and it has some real weight and consequences but so far legion just feels like a everythingmustgo black friday character death all out sale
wow,removed,how is this relevant its obvious why shine light on your own stupidity this is like that retard the other day that thought hawaii was a continent

wow,removed,its winwin i suppose anyways either it actually comes in january and the mindnumbing agony of farming the same soon bosses fades or im right honestly just quit the game if you are this sick of en a few weeks in and you are already complaining about trial i dont see why you stay you clearly contribute nothing to the community
wow,removed,oh ok and i guess input lag doesnt matter on monitors either i guess emulation accuracy doesnt matter i guess running arcade games in mame at the right refresh rate using gsync or freesync also doesnt matter who the hell do you think you are telling me what matters and what doesnt just because you can tolerate lisps speech impediments and low quality lazy cell phone video losers doesnt mean everyone can try raising your standards tolerator

wow,removed,youre still going to someone else for an answer lmao except you know as i already stated you arent do you think reading a textbook is the same thing as bugging your professor for the answer one is a text that is readily available for you to read on your own the other is an instance of you being helpless and saying please give me the answer youre an idiot kid

wow,removed,remembering fairies with the fairies nice

wow,removed,stop being a cry baby bitch
wow,removed,yeah im actually pretty stoked about the movie representation of trolls reason ive mentioned them being upright is that theyre not tall enough that way their proportions arent the as youve put it lanky towering kind they look more like orclite in this book in wow for example trolls are actually taller than orcs if they stretch themselves out their posture is just horrendous compared to elves for example
wow,removed,but gays should kill themselves why are you trying to stop that also this is fucking retarded i would rather actually die than do something this stupid if you want to do azeroth a favor kill yourself too so something this idiotic never happens again
wow,removed,im being serious not trying to get people to fall for this whoever thought that up needs to shoot themselves in the face

wow,removed,i never used any console commands to force out of old default max for years and i have never had any issues conserning vision in any raids i play melee and unlike you wannabe raiders i know how to position myself you do not need to see the whole body of the boss seeing the legs of archimonde maybe not cool is enough information also on the last phase to give a quick example you dont need to see whole seething corruption patterns because you can still melee halfway through first platform and if its one of the bad patterns you can just move a few more steps back you just have to utilize your brain youre not gonna believe but still soo heroic now mythic hfc mythic
wow,removed,good thing hes not dead quite yet dies in ret pally artifact wep quest
wow,removed,joke aside i did enjoy the holocaust actually the reich was and still is fun the extermination of jews overall was great from a story perspective and felt like it really progressed with me my only complain like most other ppl here is the lack of content after you hit and maxed out your reich overall an ok game s please dont ban me

wow,removed,the mad king planned to burn down the capital city with a substance similar to grecian fire wild fire if he lost against roberts rebellion he had an unusual and sometimes sexual fascination with fire he lost but didnt get to burn the city cersi the dowager queenqueen mothergenerally off her rocker was imprisoned by their version of the pope for incest true infidelity while married to the king true murder true and framing her daughter in law debatable she got out on bail by walking the streets of the capital naked while people verbally and physically harassed her instead of showing up to trial she burnt the equivalent of the vatican where she was to go on trial down with the wild fire still hidden under the city by the old mad king many people find it to be a defining moment for her character as it directly leads to her only living child who is also the current king killing himself and her crowning herself queen regent it will likely lead to her twin brother who has been her lover since like age and father of all her children abandoning her since the mad kings desire to burn the city with wild fire was what made him break his oath of loyalty to the mad king and help defeat him mostly its the most bad ass thing to happen on that show without zombies or a clegane
wow,removed,i
wow,removed,as an artist myself aha that explains the autistic posts
wow,removed,dont go on the sarcastic way you fucking idiot i am in a group for fucking hours and no spawn read what i said not only the last line
wow,removed,no that is not the twisting nether its like a vision alteration of reality if we actually went there if he actually teleported us to twisting nether we wouldnt be magically back in draenor after we killed him
wow,removed,ive been playing since demon hunter access was first released on the alpha give me a fucking break momentum makes something like way of the moknathal look like you need to be a keyboard champion to keep up its not fucking difficult unless youre years old or have the mental capacity of one nearly the entirety of the demon hunter toolkit is so absolutely braindead it makes anything that has any sort of complexity a joke to maintain if you actually think momentum is a difficult mechanic i feel really really bad for you and your raid
wow,removed,being forced to the new one isnt jarring and awkward then you arent a raider at all yet again you prove yourself to be retarded
wow,removed,i really feel bad for the people of this sub if you guys really think momentum makes havoc way more complex than it previously was if you take a mechanic like havoc and add it to sub rogue pre its complex if you add it to fucking havoc demon hunter its still a fucking joke
wow,removed,wat a retard
wow,removed,im sorry you are too stupid to understand the difference between pvp and world pvp you are also stupid enough to think that they built an entire expansion centered around pvp which they certainly did not your opinion is worthless
wow,removed,i can ignore it i will ignore it i hate this penchant of blizzards and now even if the story is better i ignore it based on principle
wow,removed,i agree the invasions particularly phase need to be about longer and each event in it needs to be a little bit more intricate theres just not much there if you step past the wow theres demons everywhere visuals
wow,removed,at no point in my comment did i say the closer camera was going to make the game unplayable being forced to the new one isnt jarring and awkward then you arent a raider at all sure thing pal ignore your own contradictions typical retard
wow,removed,wardens suck no doubt about that however i will say im mostly disappointed with tyrande malfurion more than anything for starters illidan spent years locked in an underground prison cell this was in lieu of execution because tyr mal argued that it would be more merciful i mean really ten thousand years it comes to light in the illidan novel that this wasnt out of love or compassion but that tyrande knew the legion would return and so she wanted to stash illidan away so he could be useful again in the future like a weapon hung up in an armory thats fuckin bullshit lo and behold tyrande needs to free illidan at the start of so he can fight the legion tyrande does this by killing wardens and guardians in the prison in response maiev doesnt do shit to tyrande for killing her people and instead hunts down illidan who literally was just trying to help out she goes so far as to chase him into outland and fuck up everything he was accomplishing there so she can throw him back in prison again seriously at what point is infinite imprisonment more humane than just straight up quick immediate execution at this point i have a bad taste in my mouth about night elf society i would even go so far as to not blame illidan for wiping out his own people in retaliation for what theyve put him through that shit isnt fine and clearly the sign of a longgone corrupted race of shitbags
wow,removed,i have a mb version that is more correct and crazy high detailed dont know any hosting sites that i can put it on other than mega so give me a few min to upload

wow,removed,feedback welcome at rimagelinkerbot with ignore me via reply or pm
wow,removed,good fuck that loser
wow,removed,i could have forgiven all the other stuff but taking such a crappy shot at david brevik caused me to dislike him from that moment on
wow,removed,which loser the loser that bailed on his wife when she was having their baby or the loser that added rmah to diablo
wow,removed,finally fuck that loser partyhard
wow,removed,this thread is going to be full of people remembering him in a positive light now hes gone it happens all the time but why pretend he was a decent human being fuck him
wow,removed,wilsondeservescancer
wow,removed,not actually sure you read what i typed i dont care about fucking i care that he pushes his opinions out into the open and when criticised get angry and defensive doesnt respect others or their opinions either sure he made a bad game but when people told him that he went on twitter rants and sent angry pms if he had just made and said i fucked up only the fans of the game would dislike him and not as much as they do now
wow,removed,did you read anything he just said nothing he just said of what you replied to had nothing to do with the game being bad he was just a douchebag regardless of him making a game shit
wow,removed,nah fuck that loser
wow,removed,fuck that loser
wow,removed,he reacts privately to someone trashing his game publicly and people are offended haha
wow,removed,i think the issue is that so many sjw terrorists and illogical racists justify their actions under this vague umbrella feminist label it marginalizes a movement that accomplished things
wow,removed,who bailed on whos wife
wow,removed,as someone who is out of the loop about devs why do people hate this guy from this thread i gathered that he worked on but i kinda enjoyed so whats the issue exactly
wow,removed,lol andrew silvernail chiming in with dont worry about it haga you made the fastest selling pc game of all time he made hellgate london it was only the fastest selling pc game of all time because of the years of hype built up by the game created in part by the person hes trying to diminish not on its own paltry merit they literally made absurd shitty game design choices that ruined the entire endgame and caused lag in singleplayer mode purely to drive people towards the real money auction house and safeguard its legitimacy their game sucked because they consciously and knowingly fucked over the players who just wanted to grind out some legendaries in order to pad their bottom line and theyre all patting themselves on the back even though their sales literally stemmed from the efforts of diablo dev team i absolutely love reaper of souls and would recommend it in a heartbeat but diablo was garbage these devs had nothing to be proud of
wow,removed,i love seeing the hipocrisy in this community lashing out at jay wilson for vanilla and his reaction to being publicly shamed by an ex colleague known for flops like hellgate london and marvel heroes personally i find it pretty unfair to put that much blame and hate on one person for flaws without also giving credit for all the good things about it fluid combat etc jay responeded angrily in a closed facebook group to an excolleague berating his teams work something meant to stay private and its held over his head for years by salty people that act way worse than him daily
wow,removed,how would you be constructive about this that word is not applicable to this situation youre the type of guy to feel bad for the guy that raped you after you got your anus impaled
wow,removed,i dont know what you mean lass
wow,removed,imagine being arnold in that scene and having to be all like damn jamie curtis you fuckin fine all sexy with your tight body and horrific androgynous monster face i would totally have sex with you both my character and the real me when all he really wants to do is fuck another year old in his dressing room like seriously imagine having to be arnold and not only sit in that chair while jamie lee curtis flaunts her disgusting body in front of you the favorable lighting barely concealing her stretchmarks and leathery skin and just sit there take after take hour after hour while she perfected that dance not only having to tolerate her monstrous fucking visage but her haughty attitude as everyone on set tells her shes still got it and damn jamie lee curtis looks like that because theyre not the ones who have to sit there and watch her mannish fucking gremlin face contort into types of grimaces you didnt even know existed before that day youve been fucking nothing but a healthy diet of blondes and supermodels and later alleged rape victims for your entire career coming straight out of the boonies in austria youve never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before and now you swear you can taste the sweat thats breaking out on her dimpled stomach as she sucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get paid to sit there and revel in her statuesque for that is what she calls herself beauty the beauty she worked so hard for with personal trainers in the previous months and then the director calls for another take and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the studio security could put you down but you sit there and endure because youre fucking arnold youre not going to lose your future political career over this just bear it hide your face and bear it
wow,removed,i got banned for calling someone a faggot because i had to go afk for my sick dog and he told me that he hoped he would die worth it

wow,removed,this post triggers me i sexually identify as a shit poster and youre currently mocking my sexual orientation and life style please take this shit post down before i call the sjw police and get you blocked from my safe zone reddit
wow,removed,imagine being arnold in that scene and having to be all like damn jamie curtis you fuckin fine all sexy with your tight body and horrific androgynous monster face i would totally have sex with you both my character and the real me when all he really wants to do is fuck another year old in his dressing room like seriously imagine having to be arnold and not only sit in that chair while jamie lee curtis flaunts her disgusting body in front of you the favorable lighting barely concealing her stretchmarks and leathery skin and just sit there take after take hour after hour while she perfected that dance not only having to tolerate her monstrous fucking visage but her haughty attitude as everyone on set tells her shes still got it and damn jamie lee curtis looks like that because theyre not the ones who have to sit there and watch her mannish fucking gremlin face contort into types of grimaces you didnt even know existed before that day youve been fucking nothing but a healthy diet of blondes and supermodels and later alleged rape victims for your entire career coming straight out of the boonies in austria youve never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before and now you swear you can taste the sweat thats breaking out on her dimpled stomach as she sucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get paid to sit there and revel in her statuesque for that is what she calls herself beauty the beauty she worked so hard for with personal trainers in the previous months and then the director calls for another take and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the studio security could put you down but you sit there and endure because youre fucking arnold youre not going to lose your future political career over this just bear it hide your face and bear it
wow,removed,fuck you and yeah fuck that loser blizzard north created a far more compelling diablo title two of them plus an expansion with far fewer resources than he had at his disposal
wow,removed,fuck that loser and fuck you for censorship the community has upvotes and downvotes for a reason
wow,removed,nice attention whoring lmao im unable to work or attend school boo fucking hoo get a freaking job
wow,removed,
wow,removed,le xdddddd
wow,removed,this is what you do with your time
wow,removed,do me a favor and drink some bleach
wow,removed,hahahaha thats hilarious
wow,removed,was super funny man reminds me of playing on nostalrius a few weeks ago with all my friends who had never played wow before
wow,removed,most toxic shit i have ever seen wow talk about dramatic if this is actually some of the worst you have experienced in game i wouldnt mind trading
wow,removed,hahaha you fucking autists a trinket is overpowered for ret paladins so they nerf the trinket for ret only would you rather them nerf the trinket for everyone or balance rets around having the trinket and end up with rets being dogshit without it
wow,removed,simple yes or no would avoid this lets act offended then post to reddit lol
wow,removed,really harassment most toxic thing youve ever seen settle down with the hyperbole mate
wow,removed,i dont understand this sort of attitude towards women in general my blood boils every time i hear of douchebags being assholes to women maybe its just because i have alot of female friends and im very protective of those i love but these little fucks need to learn a little goddamn respect excuse the language this topic always gets me worked up
wow,removed,years of uninterrupted democrat rule will do that to a planet
wow,removed,that is a perfectly legitimate question
wow,removed,lmao all of these sjws in the comments talking about misogyny just because some random retards were edgy on a girl in a video game on the fuckin internet i agree that is pretty stupid that you got min ban and this definitely should be fixed but all of these comments that these people should be perma banned and that their behavior is super unacceptable is ridiculous wow is full of some unmannered idiots and if you are taking so personally every stupid shit said in this game it will be simply unplayable just ignore and tell em to fuck off instead of this long rants about misogyny and how deep the feelings of someone were hurt in a online video game because of the chat simply ridiculous i really hope the retarded pc community will not get establishment in wow
wow,removed,in before racism
wow,removed,they havent been around for years and its not all of them they have top tier players some of which are much better than you or i but they dont queue up for the randoms like youre doing saying an entire server is bad because you experience a small percentage is dumb ive queued up with some people on stormage and they were terrible its the players not the server
wow,removed,name and shame these fucks
wow,removed,so got a tight puss in those pants
wow,removed,as a rule they dont seem to care about playing well but there are some who are freaking amazing not really sure what separates them i do know that communication is really tough as its a latin america so a lot of them dont speak english or speak it well so when you say okay half left half right watch out for the tail whip and make sure to lead the adds in a counter clockwise circle away from the tank they might just understand left right tank this isnt an intelligence thing more of a i dont speak spanish or chinese so how can i communicate with those people anyways between the people who dont care dont listen or cantdont understand it adds up to a pretty bad reputation for the entire server ive been in ragnaros groups where its acceptable to just throw the raid against the boss with zero tactics for a couple of wipes and disband and ive been in groups where their tankinghealsdps is so good they can successfully ignore most mechanics one thing i have noticed is that people from that server tend to not deal well with instant death mechanics making me think overgearing an encounter is the most common way to beat it
wow,removed,cool story vast numbers of human beings are dogshit
wow,removed,as someone mentioned most of the time good players dont queue up with randos they stay with the guilds that plucked them from the crowd of garbage theres garbage players on every single server nothing new really
wow,removed,heres what i dont get why do you and others blank out peoples names block out your name but why protect the idiots its so funny how this reddit community blanks out their names on here the same way youd blank out your address on a form or where you worn is this just a disconnect from the real world or what not trying to be rudebut i see these posts all the time and the names of the dumbfucks that are the perps always have their names blocked out block yours out and expose them at least
wow,removed,butdo you have a tight puss in them pants
wow,removed,most of the time im grouped with ragnaros players they arent the best sometimes i do get some great players and its refreshing it sucks bc there is definitely a language barrier but that doesnt account for all of the skill
wow,removed,so let me get this straight you are offended so you didnt answer on a game that requires someone to either work to pay for or an adult to pay for you got asked an inappropriate question and didnt answer and got kicked right so you post it here on a subreddit full of kids why shouldnt we report this as vulgure why is it ok for you to say it here but not someone say it there also you responded with the same exact thing they said to you right to me either a get over it b learn to make light out of idiots c report them in game and leave that vulgar stuff off a thread where kids can see calling all mods to take this nonsense down the title alone is enough
wow,removed,your a bigger person then i am i would have redacted my namerealm but i would have posted their names on reddit and let the community have at them that is kidsaholes being just that kidsaholes these kind of people need a week or two long ban from a female gm who politely points out their attitudes are not welcomed in wow
wow,removed,dem fighting words
wow,removed,death to the ciswhitemalepatriarch amirite
wow,removed,its because confirmation biased is a powerful force
wow,removed,dont let the item take your grandmother from you snap out of it man but you did say the word bear twice thats kind of funny lolol but it meant child bearing eww and it meant fucking bear niiiiiice
wow,removed,two guilds i have been in have imploded when a female was promoted to leadership and she found out there was other female competition two guilds
wow,removed,i remember when blizz paid atention to details and never missed things like this then they started injecting marijuana and turned gay now they always miss simple things like this upvote prayer
wow,removed,looks like you were in orgrimmar and not helping mightve been forgivable if you had a tight puss
wow,removed,pandemic in a room with professor putricide there are massive plague containers blue black yellow and red at the start of the fight the closest person to each of these containers get a debuff called patient zero for each color the debuff deals damage over time they all get a infection bar and a special action button called spread plague the bar increases at a rate of per second to a full bar of the button resets the bar to and spawns a ooze whos hp is relative to how full the players bar was the ooze stuns and fixates the closest person if it reaches that person they also get infected if the bar ever fills completely that person gains a stck of the debuff and more damage per second and instantly infects people and spawns an add that has to be tanked but drops mutagens of the three other colours each person may only hold of them in total but receives random ones from its corpse if of one color are combined a vaccine is created and it can either prevent a healthy raid member from being infected or may be used to channel and decrease the infection rate of a carrier each time their infection is brought to they lose a stack of the debuff and spawn adds to fight once a color is completely removed it is out of the fight and the container bursts you may notice this means that the last color wont be able to be cured this is when putricide uses a catalyst on patient and they become one of raid bosses to fight they cant control movement but can wrest control and use abilities on a vehicle bar to aid in killing themselves
wow,removed,cute story hon
wow,removed,hopefully theyve fired or better killed the writers behind that
wow,removed,get over it blizz will do something or not youll never know tho
wow,removed,it definitely isnt the majority ive encountered xxxgurlgamerxxx vent sluts who revel in the attention more times than ive been the recipient of omg youre a girl and fellow women who are just playing with everybody else are far more common than either outlier even when somebody did make a thing out of it i can count on one hand the number of times something along the lines of oh fuck off lets just play the damn video game hasnt shut down whatever unwarranted advances were being made
wow,removed,affliction aoe on fast dying targets is full retard right now thanks to soul flame
wow,removed,epitome of reddit retard the real reason hunters are good is because you tapped into the heart of the cards not because of a flat numerical buff
wow,removed,they just randomly assumed op is woman and op was triggered if you really take this type of comments seriously then i dont know what to say you just have to move on retard are everywhere no need to be triggered by them
wow,removed,oh ok so if we posted a video of this happening you dont expect us to remove names in a video right because blizzard doesnt even give you the option to do that when using their built in streaming to facebook feature so what youre saying is posting an unedited video is better than a screenshot or will you delete the video post how do you have stricture rules than blizzard themselves
wow,removed,blizzard lets us stream to facebook unedited so it looks like we need a new place to go to post videos showing harassment ingame
wow,removed,i found who was involved httpusbattlenetwowencharactermalganishozzakwazdorsimple httpusbattlenetwowencharactermalganiskasnaadvanced httpusbattlenetwowencharacterillidancrabsodaadvanced klerikdathremar was in the group but im not sure which way he voted

wow,removed,lol u turn with your keyboard uninstall noooob
wow,removed,lol the fact that youre on a pvp server and then cry when someone pvps you regardless of how they do it its like ordering a pizza and then calling the pizza place and complaining that you dont like pizza
wow,removed,auctionator and energywatch cuz the combat health thing is kinda annoying cuz its transparents and moves around so just use energy watch and turn the health thing on and ur good
wow,removed,tad too many bro all u needed farm was the frostweave
wow,removed,it depends on how autistic you are if ur autistic and give a fuck about the dumb ass story u do that if ur care about pvp then what the fuck does the story matter
wow,removed,you must be one of those everyone gets a ribbon generation of kids
wow,removed,cuz orc racial

wow,removed,damn he got fat after the movie real quick
wow,removed,
wow,removed,if memory serves youre correct on the hispanic front but i believe the term latinolatina is a geographic distinction not language that is to say that you can be brazilian and latino but not hispanic

wow,removed,youd be on us servers yeah im keen to come along
wow,removed,lol twitch lottery i just want to find a group to run with why is there money and lotteries involved is this like the csgo skin gambling thing
wow,removed,brazil is a country not a race but ok
wow,removed,quelthalas is not an brazilian server
wow,removed,you can actually be latino and from brasil latino america is all central americasouth america exluding guyanas
wow,removed,except when it now takes twice as fucking long to just do the scenario because idiots like you people on both side none stop attack everyone and dont bullshit me with youre i only attack those not attacking the monsters because that isnt true at all and you know it just got out of a half an hour scenario because of fuckers like you and youre blanket pvp bullshit

wow,removed,im a russian i dont believe you
wow,removed,once again i have to leave a message to this effect and its getting very disappointing the ability to suck at a game transcends race gender sex and creed the brazilians you meet that suck do not suck because they are brazilian they suck because the average person is fairly bad at this game and at least half of all people are worse than that people who are both brazilian and bad are just bad at the game theyre not related the people i see the most who are terrible at this game are americans do we go around talking about how shitty americans are at this game no we dont because if we see a crappy american player we think theyre bad at this game because theyre stupid but when you encounter a brazilian who is bad at the game we tend to think theyre bad at this game because theyre brazilian thats sloppy thinking and its unfair and racist stupidly prejudiced any group of people is equally likely to suck or to be selfish or to play for themselves first so do yourself a favor instead of thinking to yourself hey brazilians are bad at this game just remember hey most people are fairly bad at this game and when you encounter a brazilian person who is bad at the game remember that theyre just a person who happens to suck at a game and its not because theyre brazilian its just because they suck stupidity doesnt have any borders people edit for clarity give your comments some thought before leaving them if anything is particularly xenophobic im going to be removing it if its really shitty you might get banned second edit what the fuck guys look at this comment the user points out quite correctly that the server thats being talked about isnt even brazilian and you guys are circlejerking so hard on br hate that you downvoted the factually correct statement rwow is better than this you are all better than this stop being this this is disappointing and stupid
wow,removed,its completely amazing how you get upvoted for this racist piece of shit you shat through your mouth and then you wonder why trump is winning the race because you retards are xenophobic as fuck and happy to show it when you know you wont be judged for it
wow,removed,stereotypes exist for a reason hitler killed jews for a reason silkku
wow,removed,nah brazil is shit tier rip nerd mod
wow,removed,you havent laughed that loud in years and this is what made you do it kinda sad that pretty much sums up this community these days a bunch of basement dwelling self loathing anti social bunch of wooks
wow,removed,remindme hours
wow,removed,harambe died for this

wow,removed,nuthrall is a complete cuck i wish they didnt meme up garrosh into le villain so evil he was one of the last competent characters
wow,removed,like not alot best way is to have like chars to and just do invasions on one and hop on the other and just do that to
wow,removed,yeah i had one of those days years ago and tricked some dumb fggt into giving me officer in a guild by telling him i was another officer on a alt stole gold from the gbank and called him a downie afterwards i hear he got alot of shit for it and kicked lmaoo i ended up getting banned tho
wow,removed,nice reference

wow,removed,suckz just find something else to masturbate too youll get to erp again after the invasions
wow,removed,play launch u get dat xp from invasionz wod is free if u alrdy have wow
wow,removed,yeah fuck quests theyre mega gy and boring
wow,removed,thats not how it works enjoyment can be lessened by alternative rewards if your goal to reach is hampered by your activity then it becomes less fun youre just being a retard though the xp wasnt easy or quick when you actively played the time to finish an invasion is about minutes now you get about quests worth of xp you barely get any xp for killing mobs though because of the raid penalty the new tapping system causes youre far better off doing dungeons or questing normally before it was about equal to doing dungeons and better than questing nothing really unreasonable
wow,removed,i would care but i dont play lock lmaoo swg
wow,removed,sure report away retard im not going to form an argument without insulting you you deserve to be insulted because youre just salty trolling
wow,removed,hunter

wow,removed,any normal person would understand that indirectly claiming someone is a troll and saying fuck off you little bitch to someone is a bit different looks like you are one of those people that likes to argue for the sake of arguing got it
wow,removed,i love all the retard reddit armchair lawyers its great every single time
wow,removed,are you a literal retard

wow,removed,so i have a essay due wednesday next week would you be prepared to do that for me in exchange for game time
wow,removed,why the fuck are you crying healer is more than enough for lfr unless you re handicapped and cant press your buttons or something maybe you need to come to terms with the fact that you re a shit healer
wow,removed,i m a healer who can actually press his keyboard while looking at the screen i know i m a god op is shit healer is more than enough for lfr never listen to baddies
wow,removed,you could also you know learn to heal
wow,removed,the guild bank only gets gold from two sources players musky going and depositing and guild changes can give a certain amount of gold thats the money used for repairs theres nothing wrong with only wanting to send guild funds on people who are helping progression
wow,removed,yes that was because guild leaders exploiting it but guild must be getting gold from somewhere and it aint from ppl depositing gold to me paying only someone in a guild for repair and not all is a very very bad thing and besidesraiders have more gold than anyone else anyway and its even more unfair
wow,removed,i went out into the world and gave all the mobs some money for safekeeping since im gold capped even some of the beasts whenever i need some of that gold back i just run out kill some guys and get my gold back i ended up handing out over a million gold to all the mobs i gave more to the mobs in higher level areas and less in the lower level areas for safety reasons some of the mobs in the legion lands have over a gold each since im a nice guy you can have all that gold all of it i have plenty and theres enough distributed across the game to pay for your game time for years and years all you need to do is go out there and kill the mobs whatever you find you can keep youre welcome and im happy to help
wow,removed,having everything my way gold i might use each day is everything my way its a small price to pay to keep all members valued and the non raiders sure as hell need it more then raiders if i had time and the effort needed to be part of a raid getting better gear than everyone else in the guild thats not a raider i sure as hell would not have minded that they got a little bit of guild repair for being part of the guild
wow,removed,was that a burp
wow,removed,its called social democracy something ppl in the na dont know about but want ofc thank god i am from scandinavia communism is dictatorship and has nothing to do with equality
wow,removed,i dont need to start anything all members in the guild i am in already get gold if they run out of gold something they have not done since before legion wen i joined then there will be no repair for anyone unthil money comes in again thats fair but only for raiders i say fuck that unfair business
wow,removed,lmaooo blizzard has you delusional
wow,removed,nope its very good so that unfair guild management can be highlighted
wow,removed,by exact i dont mean in terms of lag community etc but more like geographical areas dungeons raids quests lore etc
wow,removed,my kids are not narrow minded raiders
wow,removed,you might as well just go wotlk aside from some possible changes in class abilities youll experience vanilla bc and then wotlk your progression will just make more sense if you try to do vanilla bc wotlk youll burn yourself out leveling from three times at the original xp rate and youll never make it to the expansions thats how ive felt doing the same thing due to friends gaming adhd and we just ended up all losing interest now if youre looking to experience as much of the endgame as possible molten core onyxia etc through vanillaeach expansion youll have to play on separate servers to make sure theres enough other people also looking to do that content
wow,removed,its extremely important that you know that playing on a wrath or tbc server will not give you a vanillalike at all not even close its very important that you play on a vanilla server if you actually want to experience vanilla youre thinking about this completely the wrong way
wow,removed,cause blizzard wants even a retarded monkey to be able to play their game without problem have you seen half the tooltips these days they even had to simplify and already extremely simple character sheet i swear blizz thinks the average wow player is medically autistic though when i run lfr and m w pugs sometimes i think they are right
wow,removed,did i say that all im saying is that wqs arent the second coming of jesus theyre just dailies
wow,removed,gold on usjubeithos says this site will be dead like that wow theorycrafting site from few weeks back message me bullsackhyperkritical if you want to take me up on this
wow,removed,when your healer has autism
wow,removed,people downvoting because no one cares about a shitty version of the game from go die in a fire like your precious nost shit
wow,removed,lol low level pvp
wow,removed,why are women bad at pvp
wow,removed,thats the one that requires the seer to see it chances are youve already grabbed the other damage available and i believe you can only get one of them im looking for a source on that however so dont quote me on it ukissmonstar
wow,removed,i dont even know how people like you survive life pls go be a cluelss shit somewhere else shadow priest aoe is so shit its not even worth talking about yes our target fight is goodbut that is not meant as aoe aoe is when its target and we are sitting on of the dmg or even less then other dps
wow,removed,well that one was kinda bound to exist and get fixed
wow,removed,no this post is you bitching like a whiney fucking baby about how other people have legendaries and you have none thats it thats all this is i find it funny how you think you are right yet everyone in this thread is telling you how stupid and selfish you sound yet you just go on insulting everyone like a fucking basement dwelling anti social dickhead i hope you never get a legendary you turd
wow,removed,youre a retard
wow,removed,and they let them keep that wtf you could easily farm like felslate a minute with that
wow,removed,when did rwow become a subforum for tumblr subhuman trash

wow,removed,dont think hell make it really
wow,removed,you are fuking retarded if you are serious
wow,removed,rofl

wow,removed,oh my god i would kill l i t e r a l l y for will of valeera as a pvper
wow,removed,thats exactly right i havent i have over in ap now with chests
wow,removed,exactly what i would say to you too guessing youre buttbuddy friends both of your guys responses to every thing you say is smug af pretentious piece of shit
wow,removed,haha thats exactly how i am feeling more ap in my resto spec for raid healing or more ap into my enhancement spec for arenaing have you been splitting them
wow,removed,its too bad questing there is awful
wow,removed,vashj too
wow,removed,every single child that does this ddos shit needs to be straight up taken out back and executed i dont care if theyre ddosing video games or not theyre wastes of life
wow,removed,their only goal is to prevent others from doing things they enjoy they attack blizzard riot etc theyre not clever or edgy theyre just fucking retards who need to be removed from the gene pool simple as that
wow,removed,im still enjoying those times come join me on a vanilla server friend
wow,removed,got it youre a retard ignored d
wow,removed,exactly how i feel wish some white hats would find out who is doing this and well its against rules to say what i think they should do
wow,removed,cause these little ddosing kids who should be shot and killed are attacking blizzard and their isps
wow,removed,he is literally woeking with the legion in this quest chain
wow,removed,its radical islam terrorist attacks are becoming harder and harder to execute so muslims everywhere are taking to the internet to ruin the favorite pastimes of the west we must resist remember this frustration and anger the next time that obama and his democrat cronies try to bring in muslim refugees
wow,removed,kill yourself maybe youll enjoy that
wow,removed,so its true that only degenerates play male blood elves
wow,removed,the world in which you arent a cuck
wow,removed,if youve deleted the world of warcraft folder in step i would expect the battle net launcher in step to allow you to install wow from scratch i would let it start installing open up the new wow folder that was created verify it has started to populate with files then close the bnet launcher so you can overwrite the new mostly empty data folder
wow,removed,i thought guldan was going to be the biggest gary stu villain in legion after doing this quest zone boy was i wrong
wow,removed,start over horde scum
wow,removed,anal for the children
wow,removed,
wow,removed,so i know it really isnt that big of a deal that people are ddosing blizzard i consider myself a rational person so i understand that wow and other games not being available due to ddos attacks is ultimately not something i should get too worked up over that being said i still want the people responsible to get cancer and die
wow,removed,if thats what you got from what i said youre a retard im saying that theres nothing wrong with the weapon and my proof is im doing damage if you got that that means youre insecure about your play
wow,removed,telling you why youre a retard is overreacting k dude keep making bad arguements and using improper argument techniques and btw being levels below isnt normal scaling but keep thinking it is maybe youll get first raid down by next xpac
wow,removed,then save up and purchase it when you can afford so
wow,removed,dumb retard probably doing retard shit in the dungeon if you rage quit an amazing xpac because you got booted from pug normal dungeon three days after release then jesus kys
wow,removed,get the fuck outta here
wow,removed,do you know what psychological issues are some people might get depressed or anything like that youre retarded as fuck
wow,removed,need a good witch hunt for ddosing retards that do this shit then hang all of them we can find blood for blood game time
wow,removed,kill yourself

wow,removed,theres always more dpses than tanks and healers thats how mmorpgs that use the trinity work dpsing is easier than tanking or healing so more people dps but to make up for that you need dps and only tank and healer

wow,removed,i hope you are able to find the advicesupport you need but knowing the attitude of the most wow players you might be better off trying to directly speak with the mod team that were involving it getting the subreddit back into their control when the drama went down a couple years ago best of luck to you and for what its worth if i had been able to vote it would have been for bernie
wow,removed,is betnie a horde war leader or something cant find any lore

wow,removed,youre really funny thanks for clarifying retard
wow,removed,there is nothing naive about my statement would like a word with you
wow,removed,imo i dont think an entire expansion where we lose battle after battle is particularly exciting we lose really badly in the beginning on the broken shore losing a few big heroes like voljin and varian and then we come back with these legendary weapons and kick ass everything goes smoothly until we either realize a were up against a god that can literally chop planets in half or b the void lords are much much more dangerous than the burning legion could ever be
wow,removed,i mean most of what i said is all over the subreddit the only thing that may not be common knowledge is varianvoljin dying but why visit a subreddit dedicated to discussing everything wow if you dont want to know what happens in wow
wow,removed,youre also able to get all pvp transmogs in the game for mark of honor but thats hush hush

wow,removed,so screw me for not having a crystal ball in my server choice almost years ago i get that its a business but theyve created an artificial barrier with these transfer costs and dead servers i can take my for legion and in transfer fees and buy a new game and months of sub time for another mmo blizzard is the one losing money here there are other games to play and other things to spend money on someone returning who doesnt want to play on a dead server shouldnt have to spend on transfers for the latest expansion and a subscription fee that is beyond ridiculous and there are better offerings out there for that price

wow,removed,the family familiar pet especially being bb is a bit of a punch in the gut given the amount of effort required family familiar itself is pretty fun but there was a period about two weeks ago where we went through days of zero trainer spawns so i think some attention needs to be given to it on that part i will agree with you but im willing to bet the pocket pet portal being locked behind a much easier achievement is by design so that something as big as it is accountwide pet capacity increase isnt locked behind something that could take months to grind

wow,removed,probably
wow,removed,whats the point then why play a game if you are just gonna boost to near top level
wow,removed,ill have to lol they ruined this one
wow,removed,why play a game if you just boost to top level i dont need to be an elite at the game to want my progress to mean something especially after returning to the game after some time its bull shit they want more money out of a game they have already had running for years after just releasing one the hit games of and wont give us an opportunity to go back and play the game the way it used to be before the gimmicky bull shit
wow,removed,i can see your point but it would feel better to me if my progress actually meant something i worked for
wow,removed,so screw the rest of the game you just wanna do the stuff all of the people who worked for their levels do without any of the work yeah no that sounds hella fun
wow,removed,obviously lol
wow,removed,they were great years ago
wow,removed,that is a vaild argument for people who have actually done it once like if you had to have an existing level i would be totally ok with it
wow,removed,if they already worked that far up then who cares however when people can just join and day have that same level then what does it matter to level up
wow,removed,im glad you have taken such a liking to my post since you have commented on most of the comments bb i hope to see you around more often
wow,removed,after making us pay for it monthly and buy each new expansion and they just game out with the biggest game of they still want more at the cost of watering down this game

wow,removed,exactly retard
wow,removed,you seem a lil offended take demon blades if you want but youll always do bad dps
wow,removed,anytime fuckface
wow,removed,take the post at face value its not about native americans and it doesnt need to be moderated because someone finds it offensive think of it this way lets say i opened a grocery store and someone came to me and said i dont like olives so i take it off the shelves then another person says i dont like oranges so i get rid of them if we sat there removing things simply because someone doesnt like it we would be left with an empty store this post pure and simple was about killing bots thats it any offense taken is personal and should be viewed as such
wow,removed,found the sjw
wow,removed,if they were murdered id honestly be supportive of the murderer people who enjoy ruining the fun for other people really dont deserve to live among us these children and manchildren need to learn to play fair or fuck off and die
wow,removed,i still dont get the purpose of ddosing is it just i am a retard i love to ruin things

wow,removed,hey retard how is every dh on my team so fucking good
wow,removed,wrong
wow,removed,
wow,removed,
wow,removed,at least theyre finally nerfing it the right way by reducing the proc rate instead of their previous attempts at just nerfing the damage which made the proc not even worth casting but youre right between this and the scorch belt were basically back to square one with the legendary throughput problem
wow,removed,meme pls an hero
wow,removed,not to be the downer but i am certain that during the engineering panel not on the live stream at blizzcon the programmers gave reasons why it wont be coming mmochampioncom had a summary of it and the reasons the developers gave for why it was eventually scrapped i do however agree that it would be freaking amazing sometimes we all just want to have a little private time as much as we love our bnet friends both irl and online
wow,removed,though i do dislike how nonchalant the guy is just turning his back against his mom like that i would have gotten smacked to the moon for doing that
wow,removed,its ok guys we killed the boss and remarkably none of us give a shit if the gm freaks out and calls people retards cause were not sensitive retarded fucks like you all are
wow,removed,yes i did they suck just like the spanish on eu servers
wow,removed,lol it was basically odyn throwing a tantrum and telling you to go kill helya right

wow,removed,and by the way bis relics for your weapon can not wargforge otherwise it will be cheating this is mechanic in the game i know what im saying
wow,removed,its really good for things that people wouldnt invite others to in the first place like sometimes i see someone from my guild queuing for a random heroic or a lfr wing and i just hop in with them and its really cool or sometimes someone is leveling an alt and queuing for a normal dungeon as dps so i get them an instant queue as tank or healer
wow,removed,ive never seen a guild that actually does this they all want people who are already geared but its impossible to get geared without a guild like ive hit an ilvl ceiling of im not as geared as people who already do mythic but i consistently get parses for my ilvl bracket i figure that trend would continue as my ilvl increases but guilds just auto decline me because my ilvl is low or because ive never done mythic before
wow,removed,not in this sub we arent you know this kind of post is banned for a reason right not me im too busy playing the actual game
wow,removed,not the place for this type of post please go to rwowservers posts about private servers are banned here due to the dubious legality and the vitriol that seems to spew from both sides of the coin when this topic comes up
wow,removed,vanilla was shit played nost before it boomed realised it was never going to be anything close to what my nostaligic side believes and without those rosetinted glasses on i realised just how terrible it was
wow,removed,why is that an unrealistic expectation people put way too much value on someones experience when its like the least important thing it takes me or attempts of a fight to realize what im doing wrong and to never do it again and then after a week with that guild i would be as well also because of the tiered difficulties its way easier to figure things out like ive mastered all the raids on heroic so moving to mythic is a very minor change its not like re learning the entire bosses mechanics most of it is the exact same in normal and heroic
wow,removed,so fuck that person had a guy named crelragnaros completely fuck over a bud of mines key cus i took a chance on him being people get away with too much in this game generic insult and then you get blocked before you can respond
wow,removed,i literally just said i consistently parse
wow,removed,i disagree with the rule entirely crelragnaros you are a piece of shit
wow,removed,why not its a normalized version of dps you cant look at the actual dps numbers because of class balance just because a shadow priest can do dps doesnt mean every class can even come close to that you cant look at rankings or overall because those are going to be dominated by people with the best gear ilvl is the only way to measure people without those variables
wow,removed,its not small at all gems is over stats thats the same difference as just taking off a neck you are basically gaining a gear slot in sockets alone its huge
wow,removed,and sockets give stats so whats the problem
wow,removed,mythic is like the worst way to get gear you can get alot of drops but for all intensive purposes they are completely random you cant go for any specific items because you are rolling against the loot table of the entire dungeon you also cant use bonus rolls my gear right now is literally perfect mastery is my classes worst stat and i have mastery on gear so even if i got an drop from mythic it would have to have the proper statline to even be an upgrade an with mastery or less haste to put me behind my current breakpoint would be a massive dps decrease i did alot of mythic when it first came out and of the gear i got was garbage so i just gave up on it its not even mythics fault its actually the dungeons loot tables in general for some slots there just arent any items that have the stats i need to be upgrades and for the items that do exist the chances ill ever get it are astranomicallly low theres a chance the keystone i have is the dungeon i need a chance to get loot from the chest and then like a chance its the actual item i need thats literally a chance to get what i want id much rather just do raids where i can bonus roll specific bosses i need items from
wow,removed,i dont need to worry about that stuff i already do that perfectly
wow,removed,why dont people care about them they are the most fair metric you cant compare people with dps numbers alone because of class balance shadow priests can do dps and no other class can even come close to that you cant compare people with overall because one person might be way more geared so obviously they will do more dps ilvl normalizes both of those variables so you can fairly judge
wow,removed,thats why i dont even wear my legendaries because they increase my ilvl without giving me a dps boost
wow,removed,i do go for the best gear within reason im not gonna equip a legendary that gives me dps at the cost of ilvls
wow,removed,i could save every socketed piece i ever get until i have a full set of socketed gear for every slot
wow,removed,what are you even saying lol
wow,removed,warcraftlogs has different brackets for itemlevel lets say i do dps at ilvl that puts me in the top for that ilvl bracket now lets say i did dps at ilvl im no longer top because im competing against players with better gear the legendaries i have are extremely minor dps increases like the sheild neck would give me dps but at the cost of its not worth it
wow,removed,i dont really care what my itemlevel is as long as my dps is high relative to my itemlevel
wow,removed,its not an opportunity its a fact everyone who gets a socketed item is going to put something in it if they dont then they are retarded
wow,removed,how is it more complex then that you gave one example of having people in the bracket but the brackets im looking at have thousands so that doesnt apply
wow,removed,not all the good players have high itemlevel im good but im only and i have some alts that are way lower but still good players
wow,removed,found the sjw
wow,removed,mythic is like the worst way to get gear you can get alot of drops but for all intensive purposes they are completely random you cant go for any specific items because you are rolling against the loot table of the entire dungeon you also cant use bonus rolls my gear right now is literally perfect mastery is my classes worst stat and i have mastery on gear so even if i got an drop from mythic it would have to have the proper statline to even be an upgrade an with mastery or less haste to put me behind my current breakpoint would be a massive dps decrease i did alot of mythic when it first came out and of the gear i got was garbage so i just gave up on it its not even mythics fault its actually the dungeons loot tables in general for some slots there just arent any items that have the stats i need to be upgrades and for the items that do exist the chances ill ever get it are astranomicallly low theres a chance the keystone i have is the dungeon i need a chance to get loot from the chest and then like a chance its the actual item i need thats literally a chance to get what i want id much rather just do raids where i can bonus roll specific bosses i need items from

wow,removed,lol fire if all you care about is padding numbers in bgs go for it
wow,removed,just because your shit server doesnt wpvp doesnt mean every other server is like that
wow,removed,you will like this
wow,removed,or put that bullshit at the end

wow,removed,i just wish at times like this some of us could get all the karma back we lost from correctly predicting the date months ago the very moment the august release date was announced some of us pegged the prepatch at because it exactly fits into their previous release schedule and we were downvoted to oblivion for it
wow,removed,weve had the crusade now its time for the burning jihad
wow,removed,i did i made my point at the start of the post youre happy married have no responsibility have your husband do everything for you and feel like everything should be handed to you
wow,removed,looks like the little kids that god banned from overwatch went full retard again
wow,removed,i am also just making sure that it goes both ways i dont appreciate being called names from people who have no responsibilities pawn off all chances of responsibility to others and then feel like theyre entitled to everything
wow,removed,
wow,removed,cuz he pisses me of talking only shit about legion all is just perfect in vanillia even tho is unblanced asf
wow,removed,httpwwwwowprogresscomrealmsrankus
wow,removed,competent players obviously the more disablesinterrupts you have the better but if all youre trying to do is finish the group composition doesnt really matter
wow,removed,learn to take a fucking screenshot retard shitpost
wow,removed,and a lot of the pve bis gear is in the pvp loot no it isnt
wow,removed,you need to speak to all first then the imposter will glow an obvious red
wow,removed,so the other driver saw you lose control and turned it into an insurance opportunity pretty messed up
wow,removed,tldr you will probably cry reading this im immune to sob stories at this point im a girl too btw yep this sub is still garbage upvote baiting
wow,removed,youre literally one of the biggest pieces of shit ive seen on this sub for a while youre saying there are worse legendaries than prydaz and sephuz but giving examples that arent worse youre literally getting so much base stats on nonringneck legendaries that they are up for anyones gear who doesnt have gear youre being snarky and sarcastic to someone who genuinely had bad luck and tries his best to get a replacement which kinda justifies his feeling of entitlement for the gear as he has done work for them while you advertise on your stream that you have bis legendaries and to top it all you have a of your stream screen showing a still image of a girl streamer to clickbait people to watch your stream please fuck off if you aint try to be helpful
wow,removed,get well soon i wish the best for your recovery i know this is a nitpick given what happened but im curious why finish with i am a she i know safe to assume male but gotchya i gonna be frank who fucking cares how much of what i can only imagine is a traumatic accident and fighting through the recovery of your injuries has to do with fact youre a female from what i just read it hasnt so why bring that up again get well soon op and sending good thoughts through the tubes
wow,removed,didnt think about gender until u mentioned it n yes default setting is a guy writing this lol anyways get well soon and hope things get better
wow,removed,women drivers am i right jk hope you make a full recovery op
wow,removed,while driving perfectly normal speed wise and safety wise my car lost control wat
wow,removed,is there a way to stop you from posting any more
wow,removed,you forgot the berka
wow,removed,hahaha oh you serious they didnt btw
wow,removed,no one will ever cry reading some stupid fucking nonsense about wow you might have brain damage
wow,removed,for everyone one of these stories easily solved issues are closed with a generic macro response they really know how to run customer support drown out tickets by overdoing instead
wow,removed,literally at a loss for words proceeds to type a word post
wow,removed,thats dumb as hell
wow,removed,male or female dolphin male dolphins are not known to be as nice as flipper would have you believe
wow,removed,i am a she im a vegan
wow,removed,exploit now exploit often
wow,removed,i want to state that buying level ak in is not enough yes yes it is if you think alts should be able to catch up to mains in a matter of days you are frankly fucking retarded being able to buy ak really it would be wouldnt it would mean you are able to farm as much ap in two fucking days as people did in the first month of release thats a fucking catchup if you think you need a faster catchup than that you can fuck off
wow,removed,calling someone retarded because they dont share your opinion isnt productive a it has nothing to do with sharing my opinion it has to do with offering something that is literally retarded b being productive isnt a goal for a thread with such terrible ideas
wow,removed,i dont think you understand what literally retarded means unsurprising since you think he knows about the catch up mechanics which he obviously doesnt as he blatantly demonstrated in his op
wow,removed,from what ive read it is ak you can buy through have you seen otherwise i recommend rereading it since youre obviously missing some key points wed still start over in ap but catch up quicker to where we already were on mains correct let me get this straight again you think the system is failing in despite the fact that you will be able to gain more ap in two fucking days than people did who played the entire first two months of the expansion you think that is a failure lmao
wow,removed,dont make fun he might literally be a retard
wow,removed,nice sob story
wow,removed,cool story bro
wow,removed,clicked on link that says im at a loss for words has entire page of words
wow,removed,orrrrr just play with people you know as the system was designed
wow,removed,it wasnt only designed for people you know but if you are tired of getting burned the solution is very simple
wow,removed,rwowguilds
wow,removed,what
wow,removed,cool example back on topic do you have any idea why a system such as ops will never be used because its a quantitative solution to a problem which is purely qualitative the problem is it assumes all abandons are equally bad which is laughably far from reality for example i as a tank join a group which advertises mythic easy chest awesome dps awesome easy chests i dont usually do because they arent worth the trouble but ill be down for this dps isnt doing over and they wipe times to the first trash pack easiest leavegroup and hearth of my life that doesnt make me the douche in reality because i was the one that was lied to but in ops moronic system im the one thats punished so again if youre getting burned play with friends
wow,removed,and you sir are a moron if i join a group that advertises as such and they fail to deliver im not longer accountable for that contract if you think people should still have to stay in a group after the entire purpose of the group is null and void youre exactly the type of person to be clamoring for such fucking terrible ideas as ops
wow,removed,theydo
wow,removed,ok not everyone has a key or has time to run mythic dungeons this is a video game not a job what about blizzards blind players just because you have a disability doesnt mean you cannot play world of warcraft maybe they should feel for a group because they cannot look a lot of players myself included have social anxiety saying its easy to create a group is really flaunting your mental health privilege in our faces we get it youre not afraid to walk on the same side of the street as negrows at night and there are too many options in the lfg tool that makes young healers and below always have one foot out of the door for good groups this leads to five people never really connecting in a deep and meaningful way that they could because of the lfg filters on pictures likes whispers and comments that they get one day when youre not such a hot shit shaman healer anymore maybe youll realize that signing up for everything isnt an answer patience is
wow,removed,you are extremely mistaken the answer of item level for example a quantitative answer is indeed an answer to a quantitative question the question isnt how good are you as a player the question is whats your gear look like
wow,removed,yes in fact i can fucking read thanks for asking you asshole they still didnt answer the question of how the spawn rotates or how loot is determined so if these two dont spawn on the regular tuesday schedule is it always monday avaliable for a full week with chance at loot will it not spawn every week so these are on a random chance to maybe spawn every monday but yeah i just didnt process the tweet you fucking self proclaimed genius
wow,removed,didnt see anything on my sub when i made the thread i hear if you complain about it though people will stop posting no need to be a fucking cunt
wow,removed,artistic not autistic
wow,removed,kys

wow,removed,ok why not removing every gear crafting profession they are all gonna be useless once raids kick in
wow,removed,jewelcrafting needs mining and inscription needs herbalism
wow,removed,enchanting has to make profit take enchanting gathering profession enchanting is just perfect in itself why is having enchanting a handicap what do i do people do with gathering crafting do when they cant get profit out of it and dont give me that yeah maybe they add something shit its not the case right now

wow,removed,yeah this is kind of like thanking hbo for not charging you for their app for the new season of game of thrones or the new season of silicon valley theyre charging you between a month
wow,removed,🤔 are black people even real 🤔
wow,removed,no thanks
wow,removed,lol i hope u play a tauren
wow,removed,or i could just do the dungeons myself lol no way in hell i would pay per boss for loot that isnt even guaranteed
wow,removed,the circle k raid schedule monwedfri est the circle k is a progression raiding guild with its core created around real life friends looking to expand its membership and have a fullfledged raid team taking any classrole for raids most of our members have several years of raid experience and have been playing wow since vanilla or tbc not strict on requirements just have a good idea on what youre doing and seek improvement if necessary and as always be excellent to each other
wow,removed,what a ripoff lol
wow,removed,per boss in normal mythic are you insane everybody can pug a tank that can tank it for free
wow,removed,one of my regulars does have a guild to help him gear some of his chars but he told me during a carry most of his guild are not always on when he is but i am on most of the time no life he also has the gold to spare he just wouldnt want to waste so much gold on ah gear when he has a chance to save gold and get even better gear that is on ah
wow,removed,lolololololololololololololololololol youre fucking insane
wow,removed,i would understand people buying tank queues or maybe low m carry but its pretty pointless paying a tank for anything
wow,removed,you already cleared mythic en wow
wow,removed,yeah and they literally said that overwatch is around million hs diablo million hearts of the storm million mobile games million so that leaves us with million wow subscribers wow indeed what a false advertisement

wow,removed,why you keep trying to defend yourself if im just a noob keep crying beta cuck maybe your girlfriends boyfriend will let you have a ride later
wow,removed,does the chest loot even stay specific to that dungeon
wow,removed,that changes everything
wow,removed,dont worry the republican congress has your back oh god i nearly said that aloud didnt i
wow,removed,i mean it just depends on the situation if were talking sub dungeons where some classes can solo half the dungeon then why are we complaining if were talking heroics when everyone outgears everything to the point of it being impossible to wipe why are we complaining i tank almost exclusively doing my heroics every day and i never experienced anyone pulling other than accidentially like hunters with barrage also same goes for the occasional mythic dungeon i tank though mostly i play dps there and i would never use the words you pull you tank because thats just stupid there are two possible situations he pulls you tank it nobody dies its fine he pulls you tank it you die because healer is overwhelmed situation two would promp me saying something in the vicinity of neither me nor the healer can keep up with that many mobs so avoid it in the future please tanking is so easy its silly these days and threat is a non factor so for me the only problem is if i die else i dont care what people do
wow,removed,im asking you what the value of it is because i dont see it yeah youre not paying any attention at all and you are clearly arguing for the sake of arguing im not going to continue explaining to you the value since you apparently have no emotional ties to the game and all of your experiences can be chalked up to logic i told you i want the ability to go back and do this content with my friends and have something to talk about if the fights different cool if it isnt the same then you know what bummer but im still going to enjoy seeing past content with new relevance let them reward timewalking badges for which there is incentive let them drop gear so that theyre alt friendly im done arguing here since i know that statement alone will have you scratching your head dumbfounded by the idea of somebody enjoying the game for reasons other than your experience id also like to leave you with this httpwwwautismsocietyorglivingwithautism because i think you stand to gain a lot from reading through it
wow,removed,when will retarded people like you notice that this is just a moral highground fallacy i wonder
wow,removed,how dare you monsters downvote this post
wow,removed,ill carry your books ill carry a torch ill carry a tune ill carry on carry over carry forward cary grant cashandcarry carry me back to old virginia ill even harikari if you show me how but i will not carry a group
wow,removed,feedback welcome at rimagelinkerbot with ignore me via reply or pm
wow,removed,its even more cowardly to attempt to silence them just because you personally disagree with what they have to say the real coward here is you and other sjws that cant handle anyone having a different opinion than you youre the one that really needs to grow a spine
wow,removed,after reading the comments op is fucking retarded and should just stop talking
wow,removed,ved vu
wow,removed,dont listen to this time vampire he made a claim which i completely destroyed with audio evidence and the egotistical chimp couldnt even admit he was wrong this is the type of person who would deny evolution after the evidence is shoved into his grill
wow,removed,who the fuck needs a theorycrafting site when every spec is braindead to the point of any retard with fingers can play into mythics also lol getting mods and content creators from leddit if you need memes shitposts and bad infomation way to go

wow,removed,dont listen to this time vampire he made a claim which i completely destroyed with audio evidence and the egotistical chimp couldnt even admit he was wrong this is the type of person who would deny evolution after the evidence is shoved into his grill
wow,removed,i have and but that only started happening during mop and wod during content droughts before that since tbc i only had one character it depends on how you personally invest into a character i may have all those alts but they only have playtime where as my main lock has days played and my priest has or so i still only consider myself a warlock and nothing else they´re simply just my gold farmers and tanks for if my guild needs a tank but my warlock will always be that one and my lock still holds that same feeling i had for it in tbc i still feel like i can say it absolutely
wow,removed,for me it was shurrik not many people knew him because it was way early vanilla even before the graphics update on items like gutgore ripper and obsidian edged blade but there is nothing more iconic for a vanilla rogue than grims vs sulfuras hand of ragnaros warriors or perkulators minute duel with the ashkandi ret pally outside of the undercity
wow,removed,i have tried out aqw myself the game lacks content as fuck pvp is so fucking unbalanced the game requires no skill you must be a retard if you think aqw is going to kill wow no endgame at all on aqw since the game released they havent tried to balance pvp you can one hit people on this game and no need to play pvp or pve to get better gear you can get the best gear on this game by buying it with gold and not much gold or anything when you lvl to you will have around mil gold atleast i had that much and the only thing i did to lvl up fast and get gold fast kill mobs you can quest if you want aswell but cant believe lvling on aqw the fastest way is to kill mobs there is nothing to do at the end of the game the story sucks so much ass lvling is boring as fuck no need to grind to get better gear there is nothing good on this game or maybe its but thats it but there is so much better mmorpgs out there try out tera really nice combat or swtor if you are a big star wars fan but swtor endgame is lacking really much because they are focusing on story i would recommend playing swtor just for the story nothing else aqw is no where close to wow if you think so then you are a complete retard
wow,removed,no fuck off too many rogues already go play something with cloth

wow,removed,well they all just have like mechanics that prolong the fights other thne the last one and first one
wow,removed,you created this post blizzard well thats fantastic a really neat find young man we can put that fun in a fun ball pit and then reinvest the fun into fun foreign parks with compounding fun you look puzzled for a long time you uh what blizzard its gone its all gone you whats gone blizzard the fun it didnt go too well its gone you what do you mean we just found something really fun blizzard not anymore you didnt poof
wow,removed,if you want to experience dungeons some other way make your own group
wow,removed,yes thank you i am so glad you posted this the same thing has been happening to me its am now i started trying to launch wow at about am it had an error the battlenet client wouldnt even go online i have tried so many different things and eventually created a ticket with blizzard god i hope this is just a ddos thing and not something wrong on my end i am in kansas city with gigabit google fiber
wow,removed,my lock has always been affliction but i was rolling demonology for the invasions to test it out not a fan of demo at all same complaints lots of casting and ramping up no cleave no aoe my lock is still havent started leveling him yet and i havent decided between affliction or destruction after legion hit while everyone was going and enjoying the new content i took advantage of a nearly empty isle of thunder and finally got my sealed tome of the lost legion after only about rare mob kills it has been a looooong time coming green fire ftw honestly im probably going to go affliction for legion which is kind of disappointing because destruction has all the fire spells that are going to be greenified for me now ill probably continue going after rare mobs time lost proto drake for example while the old zones are mostly empty of competition
wow,removed,i dont know what you mean could you provide a screenshot
wow,removed,still disturbed by how easy ysera was corrupted and died
wow,removed,this game is very friendly to both veterans and people like you who are starting from the very beginning i started playing years ago and was so overwhelmed at the size of the world and how many things there were to do it seemed endless and now its multiplied several times just pick a race and a class that looks fun to you dont worry about trying to rush leveling or anything just do quests explore and ask other people for help when you need it you can level up completely solo completely grouped or any combination the slower you go the less stressed you will feel and the more time you have to enjoy the content
wow,removed,why not actually research the dungeon before you run it you have a dungeon journal you have fat boss you have icyveins you have fucking everything at your disposal to learn something before you run it and waste everyones time stop pretending to be a victim and actually play the game
wow,removed,it sounds like you may have to delete the wow folder altogether thats a lot to download again though so im sure if you google it you can find which files you can delete to completely reset any custom things that may be blocking battlenet from seeing it heres what i would do personally close all battle net processes and game processes using windows task manager move the data folder out of the world of warcraft folder and put it somewhere else temporarily mine is gb delete the entire wow folder launch battle net and tell it to start installing wow after it starts installing wow close battle net completely copy do not move the contents of the backed up data folder to replace the contents of the new data folder that shouldnt have much if anything at all you want to copy instead of move so you still have a backup move at your own risk launch battle net it should scan for what it still needs to download for wow find how much you have in data and download anything remaining
wow,removed,will you post again in another week when you give in again d
wow,removed,yup rexxar is great if you like staring at an arse all day its bad enough being a skinner with a pet rexxar is just a cunt who does it on purpose
wow,removed,
wow,removed,well i used to reallly enjoy my hunter i enjoy dh i also enjoy mage and it seems cool i just get pissed off at it after i finish a fight and im on low health and have to eat all the time it also seems abit slow

wow,removed,guys can you please not waste my time yeah no im not going to beg some retard to not be retarded
wow,removed,i asked them and they said ill be getting it when i come to watch not sure if its before or after the film ill come earlier and try to get it before
wow,removed,this thread has actually made me incredibly nervous and bad feeling in stomach because of while supplies last i keep imagining sorry we dont have one for you
wow,removed,anyone wanna trade gametime for csgo keys im itching to get back in the game cries because of addiction
wow,removed,also never understood needs reward system i can understand reward for being one of the best players on server glad duel chal etc you should play for fun not for reward
wow,removed,your entire opinion is bullshit and toxic and part of the reason wod had over million people quit
wow,removed,the reason its night elves and blood elves only is because they were illidans and kaelthas followers those are the only people illidan couldve trained brokendraenei are beings of light if you will so they would never do deminoic stuff and naga but naga cant be dh due to logic and physics playable naga race would be awesome tho
wow,removed,sure those are all good points but they dont relate to the identification of a problem youve now moved onto another issue which is the representation of statistics and personal biases while these can lead to the incorrect identification of a problem they dont actually hinder the identification of the problem itself they might hinder the accurate identification of a problem but thats not what ive been talking about if we bring it back to the gender pay gap pretty much everyone agrees that there is a difference in the average pay between men and women thats more or less undisputed the vast vast majority of people are also aware that women arent paid less for doing the same job as men if you have two people who are identical in every aspect but ones a woman and ones a man there largely wont be any disparity in their pay they more or less get paid the same but now we reach the common point of contention neckbeards and the sjwcounterculture people like to pretend that the pay gap is irrelevant because men and women arent actually paid differently a common claim is that since men and women get paid the same for doing the same job theres no problem and the statistic is overblown but all weve done is move on to another problem why do women get paid less than men because there are fewer women in higher paying jobs there are fewer women in stem fields for example this is also not disputed its a statistically accurate claim so now the problem becomes one relating to job disparity why are there fewer women in as highly paid positions as men this doesnt change the fact that the previous problem identification was limited to talking about pay specifically its irrelevant that the statistic could potentially be misleading the initial problem that was identified is that women are on average paid less than men once we look into the statistic more we can identify a problem that can more easily be solved the new problem is more accurate yes but it doesnt change the fact that what we identified initially is also a problem no matter how poorly identified the problem was its a ridiculously semantic argument i know oh well
wow,removed,you clearly dont know about naga enough to compare them to mere murlocs
wow,removed,golkdoor
wow,removed,there is no better feeling than joining a random bg and going with a geared warrior oneshotting newbies with execute yes there is its completely dominating others even tho they have exact same tools as you do do you enjoy beating a defenseless child because thats what your definition of no better feeling is forced equality makes the game lame top esports say youre wrong
wow,removed,youre aware that raiding weeks a night requires you to scheduled of your weeknights to playing world of warcraft correct you literally are spending somewhere between a quarter and a half of your weeknights locking yourself away to play wow not lfr players because they wont use them anyway what does this mean lfr players play other parts of the game too but please dont force other people to do content that they dont like im not forcing anyone to do anything you fucking no lifers are forcing yourselves to do it
wow,removed,no they are perfectly comparable they are games esports is just what game becomes if its successful and more interesting to watch in some cases than play yourself let me tell you of other meaning of sport or rather good sport its when everyone is equal but obviously there is a winner and loser its not equality thats forced wows progression is whats forced and they are changing that however i invest time in my character and i want to be strictly stronger than other players who didnt invest time and resources in most scenarios and not only in pve good thing majority doesnt think like you do
wow,removed,for all the people thinking it is a scam website check
wow,removed,also you dont lose of your week with raiding of your weeknights read you daft fuck normal raiding requires a schedule a schedule that interrupts rl to play a fucking video game
wow,removed,and call of duty is
wow,removed,just because game is on pc and consoles doesnt mean there will be cross platform there wont be ever unless its some small trivial game also balance is seperate for each platform easiest examples of this practice are diablo amd overwatch also ff has more buttons than legion and it plays on console that is not the issue
wow,removed,progression doesnt have to equal in power growth and blizzard realized that if you dont like this you should play some other antic mmo
wow,removed,nah you just cant compare it properly the guy with all of those stuff maxed out still wont be able to completely effortlessly overpower someone who just started which is what the whole change is about keep power growth but make power difference actually balanced
wow,removed,maintaining near identical game version on platforms is not the same as maintaining completely different game versions the reason they dont want legacy is because they would have to stop or slow down new expansion releases
wow,removed,if you grind more than someone you deserve to be stronger than them removing all gear from pvp is pure bullshit no you dont just because youre no lifer doesnt mean you can be better than others you can be richer in game at least stronger no thankfully blizzard doesnt listen to people like you
wow,removed,exactly opposite they catered to people like you until now a nolifer whos shit at the game and can only rejoice when beating people because hes put more hours into grinding enjoying the salt
wow,removed,yea totally pjsalt
wow,removed,there are going to be some changes like orgrim being in frostwolf clan instead of blackrock kinda annoyed that they did this but yea
wow,removed,i clear m with familyfriends but raid without them since they lack the time all of them have at least legendaries three of them never having set foot into en and skipping emissary chests meanwhile i clear the raid times a week do even more autistic m grinding without them do every chest and i have one i am not salty i just think the system isnt really all that good even if the bad luck protection does exist its still rng if you are lucky and get one the chances are relatively high that its going to be a shit one and a disappointment
wow,removed,this is somehow relevant httpsyoutubeukmzgyqqydg
wow,removed,salt
wow,removed,archaelogy because it was watch netflix while my bot does the work oh and no ban was the icing on the cake

wow,removed,i think its called vaginitis
wow,removed,need to allow our flight form to mine would be nifty use our beak or something
wow,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
wow,removed,you can skin and herb you cant mine
wow,removed,sad to see preach not being mentioned he is a great starting point and really teaches you how to become better he doesnt out right say do this to be better but instead leads you into the direction of being a better player
wow,removed,triggered
wow,removed,now for heroic helya p
wow,removed,i love them this way we can separate the good fire mages from the great fire mages because there wont be any to separate
wow,removed,isnt that joke a bit stale by now
wow,removed,think about how weird it is to cross out names in a screenshot when blizzards own client allows you to stream video to facebook with no blocking of anything why because wow is a public game and we use pseudonymsnot our realm names it isnt personal information so please dont cross it out in the future thanks aup no need to defend yourself
wow,removed,
wow,removed,im not autistic enough to do this can i find generalized pawn strings somewhere
wow,removed,kys

wow,removed,and you seem like a whiny bitch doesnt change the fact you got kicked deal with it and move on with your life what do you want us to do
wow,removed,you are hideously unattractive
wow,removed,if you ask one of the hardcore you tubers chances are they have a pretty good understanding of feral even if they dont play it and they can offer some tips i know for sure preach has about a min long feral review
wow,removed,is there a childrens mode for witcher i mean its just nudity and sex which i frankly dont think is harmful but people have varying opinions on what is or isnt acceptable for their kids
wow,removed,can confirm whole guild uses weaponized autism to kill bosses
wow,removed,nek minnit lvl wf raider
wow,removed,the reasoning is twofold fuck and you
wow,removed,fuck your sauce cracker
wow,removed,youre a pompous ass
wow,removed,dude youre as beta as it gets
wow,removed,in that case yeah wont defend that
wow,removed,wont defend that specific person in that case
wow,removed,or you were in a shitty guild most old school vanilla guilds also didnt make it into naxx sure when you start off in molten core you look like a bunch of tards with your heads cut off but then you start realizing what raiding is recruiting better members and getting to the point where you guys just mesh after that most the raids were as smooth as butter we werent dying from fire at that point we were dying just because we didnt have enough gear
wow,removed,i was using past titles and i mistyped nightborne instead of highborne im sorry that triggered your autism
wow,removed,wow youre a genius arent ya are you retarded its okay for you to say that but i call out your autism and thats not allowed just as its okay to make claims about expansions but when i make counter claims thats not okay learn the rules kid
wow,removed,youve just made yourself look like a complete retard your loss
wow,removed,are you a tattoo artist yourself if not shut your fucking mouth
wow,removed,but dont cry too much or too long
wow,removed,and i wish you got aids but first you need to have sex you sad pathetic virgin neckbeard
wow,removed,i dont fuck your mom for free damn bitch better be paying for my wow subscription im sorry she cant buy you mcdonalds once a month anymore its my fault
wow,removed,lb for a guy is laughable gain some weight you anorexic piece of shit its a disease that needs to be dealt with getting married to your imaginary friends dont help either try again
wow,removed,will someone by me a wow sub will pay in aaaaaughibbrgubugbugrguburgle rwlrwlrwlrwl
wow,removed,yea so you compared an oversimplified core rotation of one of the most complex rotations in the game to your full in depth mechanical rotation including maximizing momentum uptime you dipshit maintaining momentum uptime is part of the core havoc gameplay if youre not using momentum then you are wrong fuck off retard
wow,removed,play legacy servers the game courts the casual player now
wow,removed,the game has been ruined since classic
wow,removed,dont play retail wow play a vanilla server
wow,removed,the new retail wow sucks not the game u wanna play play a vanilla private server ps they are free unless blizz starts hostin their own vanilla servers
wow,removed,dem rose colored glasses man ill say this the experience and feelings associated with vanilla wow are the best ive ever had in wow that said vanilla wow mechanicsgameplay wise was a total mess
wow,removed,youre a fucking idiot lol
wow,removed,we did a mythic run on hov yesterday and were racing through it with really good time our tank made a minor error with positioning and we whipped right off the bat the healer who had horrid healing s btw linked the combat log of damage and said gg you faggots blow im leaving your dps is too low mind you me as a feral as doing and our monk was doing which imo was not low at all for how fucked up the run got form the disposition he fucked us all over and i dont think ive been more pissed in a long time from a dungeon
wow,removed,difficulty is all relative later in the expac anything below a certain mythic will be a joke it seems like blizzard is trying to remove money not add ways to get it sans garrison also its only ap after what ap research right a while ago it was only or whatever
wow,removed,made me close the video instantly that guy is irritating
wow,removed,do ovens trigger you as well
wow,removed,which is like saying you have the smartest retards grats
wow,removed,it is clear to me that you are beyond reason so this will be my last reply i used xavius as one example because i am not going to do all fights just to humor someone who is being a retard on the internet but shaman is in the same or similar spot on every single fight very close to if not dead last and those super obvious reasons why you cant compare xavius reasons mean jack shit because every class is on the same playing field it isnt the data of a single shaman on a single fight it is the data of a shaman at percentile out of a few hundred parses compared to the data of the percentile of other classes with a few thousand parses lastly nothing about what i did was theory i gave a concrete example with concrete numbers compared to the concrete numbers of other classes how you dont understand this is beyond me but i gave you exactly what you asked for and you are just moving the goalpost to save face because you know your argument doesnt have legs get help
wow,removed,i didnt ask you why i was being downvoted fuck off
wow,removed,we can get on right now and i can link you my key if youd like
wow,removed,saurfang used pummel interrupting usaltybabes nonsense saurfang used shockwave the sundering has begun on usaltybabes ass saurfang uses devastate causing the deep wounds debuff usaltybabe mightve bitten off more than she can chew saurfang uses demoralizing shout usaltybabe likes it dirty saurfang finishes off his opponent soundly using his victory rush to regain his lost stamina
wow,removed,now youre bullshitting cause i specifically recall the item levels increasing exponentially upon hitting and having a purple pop up before i had even thought about setting foot in a dungeon just stop being a retard that for some reason thinks is justifiable for revered main i think now we know why youre so defensive
wow,removed,wq ilvl increase upon hitting makes no sense revered giving being too low makes no sense you being an main being defensive because you feel like people are calling you bad for needing the gear from rep makes no sense i think i see this issue here you arent a cuck youre just an idiot
wow,removed,i just want to hug thalyssra in response to both her getting stabbed in the gut and then proceeding to ruin her life by teaching her to be a balance druid
wow,removed,not sure why a single retard upvoted you youre completely wrong
wow,removed,shut the fuck up
wow,removed,someone gave him gold for his bullshit story he has an epic flying mount
wow,removed,honestly besides buying wow tokens gold is kind of useless these days
wow,removed,i thought that was only for pre ordering legion
wow,removed,
wow,removed,i dunno fuckin when its done you ungrateful asshole
wow,removed,hahaa im a year old leafyishere fan and i cringe at everything hahaa
wow,removed,can you not use the word retarded it could trigger people this is a safe space in which we can all be free from ableists and white misongynists
wow,removed,safe space alert please fill out all the required paperwork to indicate the time and date of the offending please also indicate how triggered you got over the situation we will send out a team to build a nice little shed for you to stay in you wont be able to hear anything or read anything we feel that this is the best option for sesntivity awareness
wow,removed,considering elisandre joins us after we defeat her it would make sense so possibly
wow,removed,well yeah but the eye of amanthul gets used to reverse time and shes like out of all the futures i have forseen i have not seen the one where you are victorious it was foolish of me to join forces with the legion
wow,removed,being a dick certainly isnt easier most people cant handle the truth and often seek the path of less resistance its actually easier to blend in with everyone and become a yes man people love to be victims this day and age sad really
wow,removed,what the fuck are you talking about youre the one being easily offended and wasting your time on a worthless throw away comment while getting triggered the world doesnt revolve around you man people are going to say stupid stuff try spending more time focusing on the actual importance of the day instead of looking to be a victim on reddit
wow,removed,both furry pandering races should be wiped out by the blight theres enough disgusting degenerates in wow without enabling that filth too
wow,removed,httpsgfycatcomspectaculardimcentipede total height we are of the distance of the combined height of donald trumps remaining bot by httpsawswariomissedcomthewallgrows rmrtrump if you dont want this bot on your subreddit or to reply to you please send me a pm to my main account so i can add you to the blacklist
wow,removed,jew spotted
wow,removed,yes and instead of dealing with them they decide themselves to become gold sellers what a brilliant idea since youre one of those people believe what you want even if you make the game worse
wow,removed,i am a tank top ama
wow,removed,while youre watching cartoon porn im banging supermodels in my corvettes kid
wow,removed,sjw responses to character art should be turned into a drinking game god knows its not useful for anything else
wow,removed,because its the inherent hypocrisy of feminismsjws they obsess over what women wear or their body type as if its a defining trait of the character all the while accusing others of nonexistent sexism for how they draw characters or enjoying a character whos appearance they dont approve of you can tell how fucked up it is because sylvanas had to cover up to become a more prominent character but illidan can still walk around shirtless and be the new chosen one
wow,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°╯╲卐卐卐卐 dont mind me just taking my mods for a walk
wow,removed,well we do have an actual psa tag now so i cant really see the harm
wow,removed,eu actually christophmatthiasmsncom kindly appreciated

wow,removed,i think we might have stumbled across an actual retard here
wow,removed,faaaags
wow,removed,newly discovered a planet much like ours in our neighbourhood
wow,removed,gottem
wow,removed,yes indeed it does
wow,removed,ohh is there a set requirement for that
wow,removed,yea i love the picture hmm maybe not do you think about the nature of the picture a pretty girl being attacked by a rather dangerous looking bull from behind its sort of not very pc
wow,removed,it will be quite challenge yes
wow,removed,jesus christ you are an entitled cunt if you act like this outside the internet you must have like no friends
wow,removed,it has alot to do with lack of responsibility in a group
wow,removed,attempt maybe hehe but he is in for a surpriseshe can probably kick his ass
wow,removed,orim home honey
wow,removed,cum and get it you nelf
wow,removed,this is cool stuff i remember back when wow was younger we used to have annual small lansjust friends bringing our own computers into someones living room and play wow day and night we bought alot of candy soda frozen pizza small amounts of beerdid not want to be drunk and back then we used a hub so we all could be connected via cable to the interwebs and wow ofc
wow,removed,why did that famous player level his monk all the way to i think it was never leaving the starting island in mist of panderia
wow,removed,the first wowers probably died of old age already its been awhile since release
wow,removed,probably not feasible but is it impossible to play legion content that is the questioncan you get onto the island and kill mobs etc
wow,removed,another interpretation thats cool its like that with artit yield room for so many different opinions and interpretations look at all the action this thread gets its wonderfull to see all the action it gets
wow,removed,yeaits a good tipi did that but my seems to struggle with settings closer to but i might try to put it at or something i have started to envy ppl that have native resolution and at least a card
wow,removed,flametalon of alysrazor run o stay jealous bitches d
wow,removed,yeait would have been interesting to find out what you are sort of mechanical stopped at doing without accepting your class hall if i dont have time to try it i am sure some ppl might try it and it will be an interesting read for sure

wow,removed,hmm i dunno sirit might very well be
wow,removed,keep the comments coming guys
wow,removed,i am fishing and you took the bait caught one of them here guys what a wonderfull social experiment this is how many reddit accounts have you spent in your lifetime search within yourselfdo you secretly want midnight calls mayhaps your imagination is quite vivid maybe you can use it on art and create fine art as i have shown
wow,removed,no they actually said theyd stop trying to put out an expansion a year not that theyd put them out more often holy shit youre a ball of misinformation your subs thats also a guess we have some numbers reported from various websites but blizzard doesnt release their sub numbers anymore but keep going keep digging man eventually youll surface again
wow,removed,yes they are playing with the down voting button again
wow,removed,ive been on reddit for about a week lol nice to meet you
wow,removed,can you say that without crying
wow,removed,you just made another wrinkle on my face from cringing
wow,removed,then you are objectively an idiot different people find different things entertaining this has been known for thousands of years boring is a textbook example of one of the most subjective experiences in existence
wow,removed,would mods mind if i advertise archi sales anywhere in this subreddit only for the next or so days
wow,removed,a blurb in an article on one of the usual sjw rags about how chris metzens daughter convinced him to be a feminist by asking why alexstraza wears a bikini mostly as a lead in for some drivel why blizzard needs to censor themselves to appeal to people who dont actually play their games in terms of things actual humans especially father and young daughter would actually say to each other its pretty laughable like dialogue out of a bad movie
wow,removed,according to blizzard gm it havent been done yet smartass
wow,removed,you forgot the kappa on this subreddits name too but you dont see me mentioning it
wow,removed,may i ask why for gold btw it is not violating tos
wow,removed,i originally took my time off expecting issues especially those pussy overwatch cheaters that threatened to ddos however i dont care now it truly is part of the experience i will be chilling my friends in curse having a good time and hoping to get in some time
wow,removed,your name suits this kind of post
wow,removed,ive only posted once
wow,removed,nej
wow,removed,bookmarking for later nothing to see here this is not the post youre looking for
wow,removed,saved ty
wow,removed,you do its going to become the dh class hall after being captured in the starting quests
wow,removed,no i just meant its not denial ive not played in months because of problems i still like the game though fuckin aids community though glad i have friends to play with still mute all makes it such a great experience at least for me its really fun
wow,removed,save
wow,removed,its called buy it from blizzard retard
wow,removed,did someone say
wow,removed,did they teach you this in a school full of obese virgins like you
wow,removed,i dont suppose you take commissions from us plebs f
wow,removed,fuck you weeaboo shit
wow,removed,but i wanna know now whats the point to ask in legion when i can test it out myself retard
wow,removed,shadow priest is for cucks wtf u doing
wow,removed,druid is like black man very strong and powerful but not very smart priest is like asian man smart but not very strong or creative shaman is good too
wow,removed,hai frand is ur gf sngle
wow,removed,punish them haha how exactly are the nostalrius kids punish blizzard i say kids because they are acting like children
wow,removed,the only idiot here is you continuing to try and sound smart by spouting statistical terms without any clear understanding of how they actually work the law of averages youre trying to push actually supports outliers like people have reported where someone runs a bunch of high level content and has bad luck on upgrades where someone gets really lucky and gets good rng on their first caches or runs you are a complete fucking idiot looking for attention the only people dumber are the ones that gilded your post
wow,removed,hello mr potato head man heres how vanilla wow looked for a gamer me in
wow,removed,youre fooling yourself if you think they have the power to stop it
wow,removed,watch all of the fucks a country like russia will give about their demands
wow,removed,jesus christ youre retarded people on this subreddit are mouth breathers
wow,removed,youre delusional if you expected or even hoped for official wow servers
wow,removed,if that made you unsub then you werent really interested in playing the game anyway
wow,removed,looks like it
wow,removed,the legacy servers would not just pop out of thin air a huge investment in development time funds and man hours would sink into something that would ultimately not benefit the main game in any way
wow,removed,sorry this is rwow suck blizzards dick or get downvoted here
wow,removed,no it hasnt you just think it has because you make snap judgements based on emotions and very little actual fact you feel like theyve ignored warriors and thats why thats the case for you its not actually so but youre convinced it is so i already know youve stopped reading at this point
wow,removed,wow talk about giving the community the middle finger fucking retards
wow,removed,i love how the blizzard shills downvote everbody that doesnt side with blizzard decisions even if they make bad ones lul
wow,removed,i wont bother retyping out what ive already gone over so ill just link a post in thread its no where near as simple as just running up a server at vanilla level
wow,removed,superb news so far the more saltier legacy monkeys are the better
wow,removed,yeah because throwing tantrum like a toddler because you think your class isnt good enough when its obviously is sure make you look like a big boy
wow,removed,i got ravaged pod in hc ilvl vendored same week got ravaged pod again in normal titanforged to gave it to some poor hunter who didnt know better
wow,removed,this comment is incredibly stupid
wow,removed,you think you do but you dont
wow,removed,im sorry but half the stuff you typed just sounds delusional youre getting super defensive when the guy is just trying to be realistic maybe ive been avoiding some cesspool wow forum but ive seen literally no hate for the idea just scepticism and if you cant differentiate between the two you have other problems no one is jealous that a small fraction of the community preferred vanilla to current content its not that there is no content in vanilla there were patches before bc for christs sake its that vanilla has a finite end once i have full naxx gear on say my legacy mage and ive farmed atiesh or whatever that is the end theres no way blizz will update the server beyond that point it would be too divisive sure some small portion of the community will stay on just to spam pvp and run raids each week but of people will quit within a year most in a few months when they hit the cap they can be bothered to reach even if the is accurate unlikely although there will be others interested who didnt get to sign so we theyll probably end up maintaining however many servers i assume they cant fit everyone at launch on for maybe people spread over those servers as they die out idk if youve ever been on a person server but its pretty shit and iirc there werent server transfers in vanilla with legion doing so well you have to be realistic its probably not worth their time as someone who signed the petition during wod i really dont care either way at this point what blizz does legion is good enough that i wouldnt quit it for legacy and at most id probably just level to and stop getting people together for raid night with flasks and food is enough work without convincing them to go and herbfarm it all themselves because the ah is dead
wow,removed,you should be interrupting even if you dont get a resourcesdps gains from it stop complaining and do what youre supposed to do
wow,removed,it would be a monumental undertaking that isnt as simple as running up a wow server at publishing it and walking away you realize that a group of volunteers build this and maintained it for a year dont try to be smart here pls
wow,removed,blackmoore represent
wow,removed,what what do you have to show for in your life from posting something that doesnt exist anymore im intrigued
wow,removed,yes you did get lucky as gear is completely rng what you got was either useful or useless i havent done as much as you but the amount you have done doesnt mean anything yes you have more chances to get gear but for all we know you have done m at level you could theoretically do m and get all titanforged gear and have a high ilevel
wow,removed,that does not make any sense because guardian druid has way better aoe dmg than vengeance and i still dont see a nerf to their aoe
wow,removed,hardly conserving healers mana by using it since when the raid is damaged by aoe were healed with aoe heals whether or not i take extra damage makes no difference to the cost of that heal you can bitch and moan all you want about not getting the best item for your epeen but it is still a worthwhile item especially if you want to progress clearly not a raider equipping it genuinely results in a dps loss if it titanforged to itd still be worse than an mythic dungeon trink
wow,removed,yeah ofcourse i mean dps it should be pretty obvious and yes i mean because that is also fucking obvious in a mythic you see if you have a and havnt done you do to get loot incase you havnt done that gives the highest weekly loot also you can complete a depleted dungeon if you didnt know that and still get the weekly loot now that we know the stuff above how exactly do you replace people in mythic dungeons well since is the highest weekly you can get and should aim for that every week you try to complete your within the timer so how do we replace people kick and reset the dungeon then go ahead and complete a and get the key into then hey suprise here also you can do the in a day and you still get the chest how neat is that
wow,removed,lmfao definition of a bitch
wow,removed,i dont show that it was deleted pulls up just fine for me also try messaging the mods instead of a new thread
wow,removed,my guess would be because its a meme type picture which is against the sub rules
wow,removed,babyrage much mister butthurt its funny and pathetic at the same time
wow,removed,kind of like glen did
wow,removed,you didnt really explain that it was meant to be just a for fun thing dude so tldr work on your fucking post titles
wow,removed,mismatched colors were accurate this pic is not
wow,removed,lol try wwwgooglecom like an adult to fix your problems
wow,removed,you purchased vanilla wow years ago they have since evolved the game to what it was today you arent entitled to them maintaining a serversupportupdatesetc to a game you bought years ago its illegal because nost doesnt own the ip how are you not understanding this very simple concept here your purchase doesnt get you anything but to play on blizzards server it doesnt grant you rights to use their ip however you see fit there is no gray area about it blizzard owns the ip and can shut down anyone else using it i dont have to believe you as i understand real life and in real life you cant just steal what you want because i feel entitled to it its no longer sold because they have moved on but they still hold the ip there is literally no gray area you are just trying to justify your entitlement to play on private servers
wow,removed,challenge accepted come on mod makers dont let this shitty limiting company stop you from doing what everybody wants
wow,removed,i stopped reading when you put words in my mouth you sir just proved to everyone you are indeed an idiot
wow,removed,do you really believe that its good design for people to not be able to gear their offspec until they have the legendarys they need for their main spec dont be disingenuous retarded
wow,removed,no it wont my sheathunsheath has always been set to and z has been set to blood fury orc and both keys are working fine not crashing so much for that theory
wow,removed,blow your load and afk you do realise you are supposed to die at the same time the boss does right
wow,removed,lmfao stm is far from broken highest skill cap class doing the highest damage seems fair to me better than the button marks topping the charts
wow,removed,disable tomtom tomtom is causing it
wow,removed,of course its
wow,removed,keep your mothers mouth off deez nuts
wow,removed,mirror
wow,removed,mirror link
wow,removed,
wow,removed,triggered intensifies
wow,removed,i just may have to continue playing wow throughout the whole expansion remindme months
wow,removed,a newborn baby will die before reaching its first year
wow,removed,its funny how you dont realize how dim you are
wow,removed,delete this fast before the sjws go nuts
wow,removed,bro go suck a dick
wow,removed,fuck off and die
wow,removed,ultra neckbeard sjw
wow,removed,this is actually really common to see in online games just a looser with a napoleon complex who will take any opportunity they have to exert any sort of position of power that they may come across upon others the guy probably doesnt have a say about how anything happens irl i used to know a guy just like this he worked as a librarian and literally acted as if he was the king of the library and treated customers like plebeians
wow,removed,hilarious if only i wasnt dead
wow,removed,she can fell corrupt me any day
wow,removed,are you level you cant just post in the comments youll have to follow the links and pay attention to their process
wow,removed,man i would love to lick her butthole

wow,removed,its because youre a newfag
wow,removed,hi and thank you for replying im sorry for the post you may report it and delete it if you want i just didnt see the harm in asking not begging apologies again and good luck for legion
wow,removed,im sorry didnt realise this kind of post would cause such an uproar i have a part time job and im a full time student its just the funds i had reserved for the game got chewed up by an unexpected bill apologies again
wow,removed,hi and apologies first of all i am able to play its just the funds i had reserved for the game got chewed up by an unexpected bill apologies again
wow,removed,i guess youll just have to wait longer and start saving again sucks you cant play on release date but youll be fine itll give you more time to study and put in more hours at work btw people dont like these kinds of posts theres plenty of students in the same boat myself included and we made sure to put priorities first and if allowed play this game yet we dont go around asking for a free game maybe if this game was and not
wow,removed,curious how you would even have time to play wow when you are a full time student and work part time
wow,removed,part of me wants this as well because it would be convenient but at the same time it would be too easy you know tldr fuck off retard
wow,removed,because everyone in the game has done what youve done actually by this point there have been quite a few retards who havent tagged their shit so im sure the number of people who dont already know is pretty low your post is still garbage regardless
wow,removed,the points youre making are so irrelevant i wont even bother explaining
wow,removed,if you still dont have your moose you must not want it only costs gold pony up and stop looking for handouts
wow,removed,shit reply kys
wow,removed,it feels as if they want to make her likable to people outside the waifufag demographic but doing that they do a literal on her personality etc i feel so alienated with wow these days i just cant suspend my disbelief with all these retarded decisions and these writers its really sad because i used to think warcraft lore was pretty good but now its being slowly killed
wow,removed,good for you doesnt mean its not ugly
wow,removed,
wow,removed,q o
wow,removed,you need to suck a dick
wow,removed,idgaf about normal pvp circumstances im saying motherfucking tiger palm hit me for it says right there you need to calm down go outside you elitist fuck youre probably max trash anyway
wow,removed,jew
wow,removed,do you even think about possibility that at start i just wanted to say you in polite way that your class is not only one with issues probably not because you didnt do this in any sense of the word polite actually i feel really sorry for you if you behave like this every day i feel really sorry for you if youre a snobby little asshole to everyone every day all while not knowing what context is
wow,removed,you retard
wow,removed,to the tank who pulled everything in hov blamed the healer for sucking even though you didnt use any def cd and then left saying we suck i will cone to your house and use your brainstem as a jump rope in the nearest way intersection and then touch myself inappropriately
wow,removed,i recently switched from fury and im liking arms a lot but i have a lot of downtime im playing the focused rage build but i often find myself with no rage to anything my rotation goes like that charge cs focused rage and slamor whirlwind if aoe until stacksms i use battlecry on cd can you give me any leads
wow,removed,right you are a massive loser
wow,removed,oh god was it so simple thanks mate ill try it out asap
wow,removed,edit i dont care about downvote or karma go for it fanboys blizzard fucked up you just dont want to admit it
wow,removed,wahh others got things i didnt
wow,removed,wahh i didnt get a legendary item within weeks of the game releasing wah others did wah i want it wahhhhh
wow,removed,wahh my raid spot im entitled to legendaries wahh other people are better than me weeks into an expansion wahhhhhh
wow,removed,wahh im entitled to legendaries wahh other people are better than me weeks into an expansion wahhhhh people who think im pathetic are retarded year olds and im definitely not a retarded year old whining about legendaries wahhhhhh
wow,removed,yep that was also it my two mistakes were slam under rage ms on cd
wow,removed,when youre chugging down a big old aids cock do you cup the balls or give the anus some love too
wow,removed,you realize its incredibly useful even for top end mythic raiders right knowing when a spell is about to be cast seconds before it is helps so much i guess you can just keep jerking yourself off over how good you are while looking down on us scrub lords for being shit at the game and youre saying you didnt use dbm for the big laser mechanic on archimonde i wonder how many times you shot your raid in the face
wow,removed,knew what it was before i clicked always nice to see another fellow gay retard
wow,removed,to many mythic xav shit posts nobody gives a shit
wow,removed,noone believes you
wow,removed,they dont dude would you like me to upload the playstv trash highlight of me opening the only boxes that do arent old they were the kept uncompleted before reset you are wrong suck shit
wow,removed,to add salt to the wound its even a connected realm i play on frostmourne and it isnt a connected realm
wow,removed,lol fragile much
wow,removed,looks like an easier choice than the gym
wow,removed,remindme week
wow,removed,oh yeah i am such a retard for not playing a period of time
wow,removed,only mythic heroic doesnt mean much
wow,removed,aye man dont be a fucking snitch snitches get stitches
wow,removed,but i guess u dont understand much about that anyways il ap us top guild youre right i know nothing happy to link my page with ss proof if you do the same their fucking main page says they dont do split runs and you can check their logs to see they dont bring in alts
wow,removed,is it worth playing on elysium the site doesnt have a faq and their subreddit is full of drama seems like they have to remove their server core im scarred that they will shut the servers down as soon as i start playing there
wow,removed,unless youre talking about the woman beating the man there is no such thing as domestic violence
wow,removed,lol an obviously broken spec gets a slight nerf and its benched fucking fotm re roller trash
wow,removed,christ almighty lol go drink bleach its amazing how people like you yearn to be offended by everything and want to silence people who say things that hurt your little feelings here are some hashtags for you dontbeapussy manup specialsnowflake
wow,removed,hjkghik
wow,removed,are you referring to heroic or normal we ran normal and easily killed krosus with only a few of us at
wow,removed,normal was easy so was heroic the only hard part was people not researching the fights beforehand
wow,removed,no people assume the ilvl cap will increase when m nh comes out cause thats what happen with m en
wow,removed,because they dont want people walking into mythic nh and outgearing it the ilvl increase will happen next week
wow,removed,dont care when you started its almost always just for dickhat points or a poor mans im right card
wow,removed,not if you want to get server first
wow,removed,i didnt say i killed guldan heroic the only guild that did it kill was a top guild that didnt do split runs lots of other guilds could have to if they wanted to
wow,removed,i killed in hours first you assume i killed heroic guldan then you assume i only killed first boss stop assuming
wow,removed,bot was hardest just because it was the less forgiving imo we wiped once to the flowers and another time to not knowing what the arcane debuff in the last phase does but pull we got it
wow,removed,still better than that chick with that annoying accent
wow,removed,hey look a witch hunting thread with no proof of anything
wow,removed,my honest advicemove on and dont hold a grudge if you want your money back take him to small claims court if you feel you have a case people harassing me in a game wouldnt make me want to give the money back any more
wow,removed,use normal mythic dungeons to gear up for mythic then work your way up though the levels the game has always been reliant on ilvl you just have to realize there are people with better gear taking your spot
wow,removed,ive been playing on the elysium vanilla pve server making friends and enjoying the community so far something that i havent experienced since i started wow back when it launched leveling my priest with my warrior buddy has been the most fun ive had in wow
wow,removed,yes some people have
wow,removed,as a boomkin i did very well on any fight that has more than targets
wow,removed,if you are in a high mythic progression guild then you should reroll but i highly doubt that you are because youd rather complain about rng on reddit
wow,removed,yes people are so serious about wanting cutting edge for a raid thats been out for hours
wow,removed,elitist post is elitist most upvoted on sub elitist sub didnt want that verified but now it has been
wow,removed,yes this is common lore knowledge
wow,removed,are u begging for ritalin
wow,removed,white male hunter zimmerman kill dem monkeys
wow,removed,im honestly glad to hear youre having pain
wow,removed,did you group use the puddles correctly
wow,removed,ironically youre being racist while complaining about racism
wow,removed,have you ever seen a tardwrangler deal with a pack of autists that is basically raid leading with hunters in the group
wow,removed,you want to run nighthold but you never run en or tov or something ffs dude you are a pathetic leech
wow,removed,
wow,removed,wow that is so bigoted just because someone thinks differently then you they are uneducated this is why we have a brexit and trump educated people trying to teach then uneducated that what they believe is wrong by talking down to them
wow,removed,and this is why they call legion virgin simulator
wow,removed,yeah thats what your fucking weapon is retard
wow,removed,rkys
wow,removed,i got the chest atleast i wont die ekowraith
wow,removed,hey i always pick fire mages above literally all other dps classes no exceptions
wow,removed,as a resto druid make your own groups
wow,removed,the fuck man httpiimgurcomsyloybjjpg
wow,removed,you have a total of wipes on this difficulty
wow,removed,as someone who is the leader of the your key runs i dont see why i should give up my leadership as i just dont kick people anyway kicking and finding someone new costs too much time
wow,removed,nah you need to do it a minute before you down the boss so they get autokicked from the instance and you cant solo the boss
wow,removed,yeah but you have to share it with fewer people
wow,removed,haha as a healer there are still people begging to get into my group
wow,removed,who care
wow,removed,kicking people is not stealing ofcourse ill kick the lowest dps so they deserve it
wow,removed,reported
wow,removed,yeah it is easier to farm i started out today with a keystone and it is hard to farm those with pugs
wow,removed,reported
wow,removed,reported
wow,removed,lets be real they wont there are just too few groups for too many dpses
wow,removed,right cry for attention by your mate better just to let himher die
wow,removed,they think they can but they dont
wow,removed,kys
wow,removed,im somewhat proud but i expected some real answers this isnt helpful at all
wow,removed,this is blizzards design cant ban me for that
wow,removed,i have a job
wow,removed,reported
wow,removed,yeah it really hurt me
wow,removed,reported
wow,removed,reported for witch hunting
wow,removed,does it prevent them from getting loot can i get all the loot for myself
wow,removed,look at mr nice guy on his high horse over here
wow,removed,thanks
wow,removed,when people decide its their time to go and others feel morally obligated to impose their misguided and self serving actions to prevent that person from doing so it is incredibly insulting to their autonomy and individual choice they didnt save your friends life they ruined it by preventing him from making a decision that he came to the conclusion was best for him
wow,removed,reported
wow,removed,what
wow,removed,how so
wow,removed,get off your high horse
wow,removed,that one is definitely a really good one aswell
wow,removed,cool
wow,removed,about

wow,removed,reported
wow,removed,that sounds fun to do
wow,removed,the front page of that sub lists a video of some fgt demon hunter arena so no thanks
wow,removed,shitpost
wow,removed,theyre all fucking tryhards the class could be played by an actual four year old even their mobility spell deals damageits just like dk it attracts idiot mongoloids
wow,removed,everyone else has used sou d logic and you stick your fingers in your ears shouting about how only you can be right and everyone else is wrong
wow,removed,thats insane this one was hard to find
wow,removed,what level of mythic equals hc raids
wow,removed,bbut why
wow,removed,make your own group you cuck and have no ilvl requirement thats how i geared up my hunter and druid
wow,removed,this happens to me every time i dont get loot
wow,removed,so first thing you are gonna want to do is uninstall the game then seek therapy
wow,removed,as a resto druid ill take your interrupt if you dont need it
wow,removed,melodramatic much lmfao want a linkin park cd and a butter knife to cut yourself with

wow,removed,how did you get your auras to show up like that
wow,removed,i always welcome some advice my talents at the moment are eye of the tiger celerity black ox brew black ox statue healing elixir special delivery high tolerance its too early for me to be playing with blackout combo its messy when i try statue over leg sweep because i sometimes have a hard time picking up adds special delivery over jade wind because its fun as hell does good damage and doesnt require pressing a damn button every six seconds like clockwork i like the decisionmaking of brm and i feel rjw has no decision in it as far as playstyle i usually pull with keg pop ironbrew fire punches here and there keg always asap maintain ironbrew purify if stagger gets in high yellow for boss fights or big packs i pop ironbrews immediately keg and punch until i get a charge ironbrew it then black ox brew and use those to purify if need be or to maintain iron i try to use explokeg when my stagger is high and i dont have enough charge to purify so i can get seconds damage free forti brew is a good ohshit button that i tend to forget i need to do a proper weak aura for it one thing i feel i struggle with unexpected adds if fire and keg are on cooldown i tend to panic try to taunt one punch another but it means moving around a lot which isnt always good sometimes i pop the statue when i feel theres no danger of aggroing another pack i really cant understand why they removed dizzying haze it really was a great tool that perfectly fit the fantasy the other thing where i struggle say i had to pop black ox brew on a big pack next big pack i have few charges say i pop two on iron then i have to purify and now i have no charges and my stagger is high and im kind of panicking maybe its because my haste is still very low so the cooldown on my brews hurts if you have some advice ill gladly take them tanked the lfr tonight it went well but then its lfr
wow,removed,
wow,removed,seeing as they are russian im just going to assume they somehow exploited something
wow,removed,yes because you cant get an aritfact weapon skin from doing a fucking normal mode raid because you suck at the game congrats on being a fucking cry baby because you cant do a normal raid to get something i guess them putting tier and trinkets back into the game and yes my guild is one of the top guilds in the world so thank you for saying im acting like it is now please tell me more about your awesome plus mythic keystone run you cant even chest

wow,removed,survivability is top notch at least for affliction and demonology dunno about destro downsides are shitty artifact uptime sometimes on affli looooooong rampup time for iffy dmg that has to be maintained by juggling dots no mobility no burst and you have to talent into aoe and its crap taking away an additional dot basically what icyveins says about strengths and weaknesses really httpwwwicyveinscomwowafflictionwarlockpvedpsguide
wow,removed,you can get but its sort of a learn through experimenting with the game mechanics that will help it stick in your memory some things are covered like the basic interface buttons addons quests spells mounts gear and combat comes later on watch that lazy peon video and pause then rewatch it after playing so that more of it sinks in most of this video is just prerequisite and its fairly fastpaced so watch pause take notes watch it again until it sinks in if you end up buying a level one comes with the purchase of legion then you can get combat guides from sites like httpwwwnoxxiccomwow simplified or httpwwwicyveinscomwow more advanced guides generally technical but preferred though at the beginner level it doesnt matter much which is good or bad as indicated noxxic can sometimes be wrong but at this stage of the new expansion everything is subject to change if you do look at the guides a dps rotation is handled as a priority list or sometimes a starting rotation the idea of the priority is to give you an idea of what spell does the most damage and to have that used or on cooldown first or as an ideal ie if you had a choice use this first to do the most amount of damage or to keep a buff or proc active buffs are periodic boosts to a stat or damage increase or personal effect procs occur more randomly based on alternative status or as part of an item that boosts damage ie legendary weapons trinkets bonuses on armor potions etc if you look at the dps rotation of a particular class youll likely notice that spells are sometimes listed twice and this is due to sweetspot mechanics that sometimes exist for some classes ie if you have a spell that does more damage if you have an active proc or otherwise it might be listed at the bottom indicating that this is the base abilityspell or a filler ie this is what to hit when you have nothing else to do
wow,removed,we had just barely started pulling trash in vault of the wardens on mythic when i took some damage lance was kind enough to heal me so i repaid him the only way i know how with a hug little did i know the amount of triggering i was about unleash
wow,removed,maybe she caught lance with another elf under the world tree now she keeps him on a short leash
wow,removed,do you go around fucking with insecure couples does that seem like a fun thing to do from your perspective op is a troll and you are validating her
wow,removed,the one or two pulls he did actually do his rotation he was about dps my alt hunter was doing around didnt say he was a bad player instead that he was afk looking at skada on fenryr he only ever used aimed shot once and barrage once and sidewinders twice thank you for the compliment though i indeed have worked hard to gear both my main and my alt in the first week up to mythic
wow,removed,cucks who are too lonely to deal with themselves while they find a suitable mate who instead settle for some bitch who bosses them around
wow,removed,then end up being and lonely putting pictures of your dog in facebook because all your old friends are busy on family vacations and pets are the closest thing you can get to the unconditional love required for true human happiness
wow,removed,consider ending your life
wow,removed,sorry if this triggers people now so here is a trigger warning for you but autism
wow,removed,if the message is that youre an asshole message received
wow,removed,i personally would probably send the extras straight to the guild bank but seeing this was in a raid id be distributing them freely first as well as giving said guildy a few extra but all thats overboard
wow,removed,rules up front sure thats easy but none of that was mentioned in this instance i shouldnt be called a selfish prick just because of something so trivial and pretty cut and dry at that
wow,removed,so let me get this straight i spent the time gathering herbs and subsequently crafting enough flasks and potions to get to rank and proceed to not charge someone to make them said flaskpots with mats for example flask i proc and get flasks i am now obligated to give them the extra companies dont produce things efficiently to just give them away for free this is just back asswards thinking
wow,removed,you are wrong they gave me enough mats to crafts x amount of flaskspotions nothing more nothing less fox flower aetheril and starlight rose gives you one stam flask that is what you expected out of the exchange if i proc and get more it is because i spent my time and my mats to get to that point i am not obligated to give you anything more than what you gave me to craft the same goes for the free market you get what you pay for
wow,removed,its not selfish youve put time and money into the profession and the procs are a benefit of your profession its not selfish to gain some benefit in the process of helping your friends and guild members as somebody who has been the guild alchemist in the past wrath and cata and spent a lot of time making consumables for people i wouldnt fault you at all for keeping procs id get what my mats are worth and youd get a nice bonus for your trouble everyone can benefit from the transaction so in all honesty its selfish of the other party to take all of said benefits for themselves
wow,removed,the alchemist deserves to get some benefit from their professions use if it was a random player id keep the procs granted id say so ahead of time if they wanted them then i could include them for a tip i just dont think its any more fair to expect an alchemist to give up all benefit gained by their profession one person brings the mats and thats important but the other brings the skills to do something with them and that should be valued another players time and abilities are being utilized not an npc or anvil
wow,removed,so if youre a tailor and a guildy asks for an imbued silkweave piece do you go and google the mat cost when the pattern was star and ask them for that
wow,removed,that based on some of this thread you dont get
wow,removed,yeah nice horn handles your head would be moving up and down reaal fast if i had my way ahahaha im eating mcdonalds
wow,removed,keeping procs when youve never stated your position is wholly dishonest no it isnt you gave enough herbs for x flasks you get x flasks thats totally honest you got what you paid for essentially
wow,removed,i was expecting the cut to be of that gif where the guy was falling into the water from really high and landing on the one thing out in the ocean and dying
wow,removed,the timegold alone it takes to get rank to even get those procs means it should be imo
wow,removed,this
wow,removed,could you not just find it on the internet somewhere
wow,removed,how are you screwing your own guild members if they expected flasks from the materials they gave you and you procc at least i would have the decency to give the crafter half to sell as a gesture of gratitude
wow,removed,what attention whore where the hell did that come from you wont shut up even if you are off topic are you im not offtopic at all what makes you say that the topic was that the real catch up mechanic youre moving the goalpost to your own definition you said that there was no catch up before wotlk which is false catch up is catch up didnt help to get faster in sw uh yes it did even if its not bthyjal gear its still something that lets you skip previous tiers and like i said swp was still raid that basically just needed gear from bthyjal now fuck off kthxby why are you so angry
wow,removed,welcome to reddit
wow,removed,youre dumb go back to youtube comments
wow,removed,he never called you a selfish prick he just said he was not one he did say you wouldnt see eyetoeye that part came true by all means internalize everything said by people on reddit though that seems like a route to success
wow,removed,you are a selfish prick if you react like that
wow,removed,holy fuck get out from under that rock you retard
wow,removed,its either proc split or the fee is per proc you want you dont get to reap the benefits of the profession they spent of thousands of gold to get rank for nothing
wow,removed,this has nothing to do with insecurity you retard if you publicize playing this game you are a fucking moron then again all of you are just armchair psychologist middle class shitters who suck at the game and life i guess i am too because by your logic insultingprojecting
wow,removed,you deserve nothing you rusty spork
wow,removed,it also does not make me look like a jack ass who wants to get upset because someone posted something you view as meaningless keep your bitching off of reddit the community is already toxic enough as it is shitpost
wow,removed,its the ultimate troll method now the best was when i turned up in a group the other day with a similar title then the leader said ok ill pass you leader now and you can run the raid like wtf are these people smoking its endless it makes me want a guild but then i miss out on that odd time when i end up in an awesome group that pretty much shots everything cant just replace guildies if they fail lol
wow,removed,

wow,removed,the whole being benched for not having one is bullshit either your group of players are raging cunts or you somehow have a mythic raid roster of like people in which case every other mythic guild is jealous currently and skilled players are hard enough to come by alone definitely wouldnt take some shitpump who dies in the fire every second attempt just because he has a leg
wow,removed,youre dumb as hell my friend
wow,removed,and when you rage quit because youre an edgelord dh insistent on blaming everyone else but you for your own death remember that we have meters that show you killing the adds and then dying to impales that youre meant to use the adds to soak you just make yourself look a cunt to everyone yeah you rantover

wow,removed,yeah gonna try to get a group for that when i get on tonight cheers
wow,removed,why do i assume youre elitist the whole it only takes a few hours to level bullshit that youre peddling for a start i figure you could get a level in minutes only if you know the best ones to go for and dont get distracted even a little bit and dont get boredand even then youre looking at hours between and not a few hours as initially stated
wow,removed,congrats you are the millionth person to post this happening to rwow you win the grandprize of jack shit

wow,removed,better ask rwowmeta
wow,removed,sigh ok here it goes you are too stupid your knowledge is not high you are retarded
wow,removed,some bots like honorbuddy have really well flushed out rotations and can do better dps than actual players
wow,removed,the haste gets diminishing returns at around which is of a well geared players mastery
wow,removed,httpswwwbaddragoncom nsfw
wow,removed,i think i speak for everyone here when i say this go fuck yourself
wow,removed,aw a dungeon that doesnt hand inept players like yourself everything instantly better go cry on reddit about it
wow,removed,you are an idiot
wow,removed,dreadlord
wow,removed,op you are very stupid please delete reddit wow and your life this it too much stupidity
wow,removed,d read my question im not asking if it is better but how much before you pose use your brain
wow,removed,hey look on the bright side it could be worse your parents could have named you millicent im a bot and i posted this reply automatically it could be worse
wow,removed,man youre way too retarded to have any kind of conversation however i will give you one more chance to see the obvious it is the fact that the points op made about the flying and outdoor content are irrelevant that will not change with downvotes
wow,removed,to be fair every point of view on this situation is speculation there is no facts here we can only speculate on what might have happened if the horde sacrificed themselves maybe you are right maybe azeroth would be destroyed by now no one knows this is my point of view you said that varian called that the alliance had achieved victory but did them think about varians perspective at that moment every flank was secured and they were on top of the portal ready to destroy it anyone would call it a victory but in reality not every flank was secured he couldnt see that the horde was being obliterated by the time sylvanas sounded the horn the horde was done almost every major character was injured the horde was trapped there was no way for the horde to escape the trap was perfect except that guldan doesnt know this world very much in my point of view he couldnt have antecipated the valkyrsis this the correct plural the only reason the horde escaped was because the valkyrs carried everyone to the safety of the ship so lets break this down into a more strategic and easier way to look at this trap let the horde and alliance get away from the shore to make their escape more difficult when they think that the battle is won overrun the horde flank with the horde destroyed drop down a massive fel reaver on top of the alliance make waves of demons jump down from the cliff where the horde was and flank the alliance cutting their escape im not saying that im right and youre wrong im saying that no one can predict what might have happened but to me it is very clear we had no chance of winning this and sylvanas making the decision to sound the horn might have saved the whole world because guldan played us like fools he made everyone think that the battle was won but it was far from it
wow,removed,welp it seems youre still not seeing the irrelevancy here i cant go any lower to explain how retarded you are
wow,removed,ah yes obviously a reference to the shooting eric garner and the consequence riots which ensued
wow,removed,ecks dee
wow,removed,ecks dee
wow,removed,hey guys i got the reference too wheres my free karma for putting in the absolute minimum effort required d

wow,removed,there was no fuss other than one manufactures by gamergator manbaby types to strawman le sjw menace
wow,removed,there is a chance i can beat the mountain in a bar fight while blindfolded too but you do understand how unlikely that is i mean not to be rude so i apologize if i am underestimating your combat prowess but yes im pretty sure its extremely unlikely more unlikely than our chances of success at the broken shore imo too youre glorifying what a chance is no in your opinion i am just because you think it was impossible doesnt mean i do too i have still yet to see a compelling reason to believe guldan would be so omnipotent he could kill us all with ease plans the broken shore down to an absolute tee while also completely disregarding the fact that the horde can retreat with ease while trying to destroy the alliances means of retreat without dealing with it before he arrives if he is so powerful these key facts are contradictory to eachother and to the narrative of us playing into guldans hand as we pushed for the portal so to follow your analogy in a world where we had say a chance against the mountain because i still believe the chance we had was less likely than our chances of failure it should be pointed out again in your bar fight however if we walk away from the barfight now to fight another day the mountain will grow stronger and begin to roam about indiscriminately killing thousands upon thousands of innocents perhaps in your future encounter you would face better odds and perhaps you would not he is getting stronger after all many would try to kill the mountain now and many would think better to retreat theres a very rough analogy of my view of events in no way could varian beat current guldan he made it as close as he did because guldan let him you can try to disprove that all you want by saying we dont know that he did he isnt stupid he had us exactly where he wanted us he couldve crushed everyone before the gunship came but he chose not too he then summoned the reaver and wouldve killed everyone but varian did an admirable deed well first i repeat what i said above and then ask what on earth makes you think he couldve crushed everyone before the gunship came but chose not to why would he not i still have yet to see a single reason to believe this is true if he wanted to end everyone when they got on the gunship and he was capable of incinerating everyone on the ground why would he not just do that the end goal murdering all of the alliance forces if we completely ignore the fact that your omnipotent guldan has decided he is ignoring the horde for some arbitrary reason is the exact same in both situationsone just involves dunking a fel reaver on top of the airship which as we saw isnt very reliable while the other apparently involves killing us all on the ground with ease do you understand why varian sacrificed himself because he knew if he didnt stop the fel reaver all hope wouldve been lost for the alliancelosing all its big named heroes wouldve called irreputable damage yes i do i stated it plenty of times yesterday that varian made an incredibly noble and heroic sacrifice i dont see how its relevant to guldan being as strong as you are insisting he was given again he chose not to destroy us on the ground for some arbitrary reason though by the way big ups to your namei didnt notice that yesterday rep

wow,removed,in short shes a woman old wooden ships and all that
wow,removed,i dont he is one of the extremely few characters in this game to have died a hero he deserves his rest as a character maybe im biased or whatever but i loved playing through the years and seeing his character develop from what it was to what it is when he died after all these years he deserves his rest think about other characters jaina lived long enough to become a disliked character thrall certainly isnt liked as much as he used to be other characters like voljin and tirion die deaths with really no meaning or impact other than something to further the story voljin so sylvannas gets her warchief redemption story tirion so that the player can get the ashbringee varian is the first character in a while to get a meaningful dearth where he died whilst being viewed favourably by the playerbase in a way that furthers the story but isnt shoehorned in i personally dont think we have had a death in this game which hasnt been awful or something not worth caring about since arguably nazgrim
wow,removed,they ruined hon
wow,removed,find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec find a guild that will let you play your spec

wow,removed,httpadultimgsitebvhgifv
wow,removed,sounds like youre retarded tbh
wow,removed,if my being ganked saves a life than im happy to be ganked
wow,removed,its because mexico doesnt have amazing english skills so mexicans and south americans in general stick to spanish speaking groups online when they join as a man they dont speak english and get pissed when you dont speak spanish even though its an english speaking server this is also why russians have the stereotype in europe theres dozens of different languages but everybody speaks english except russians because theres enough of them that there might be another russian speaker in the game and fuck anybody that speaks english however theres a decent amount of confirmation bias when a mexican or russian speaks in good english you dont notice them because theres functionally no difference between them and an american but when they speak their own language expecting you to understand they stand out that means all your spanish russian interactions are with assholes therefore every spanish russian speaker is an asshole when in reality its only the assholes that are using it on english speaking servers
wow,removed,get over it youre not going to get a free respec classes get nerfed all the time
wow,removed,here is a pro tip blizzard devs are the biggest bunch of liars on the planet they will never tell you the truth as to why they do anything it would be childs play the release some hotfixes that put all the classes within a couple percent of each other so why dont they do it because they dont want to do it not because they are lazy but because they believe it helps make them more money whether its true or not i cannot say but they sure as hell believe its true
wow,removed,its not swindling
wow,removed,dont expect op to reply here
wow,removed,wow is garbage
wow,removed,this doesnt answer the question
wow,removed,wow cuck its like you cant even fucking read some improvements for fury are coming in number tweaks as well as less damage taken from enrage so really how is that telling you to fuck off when they are putting in changes that benefit your class piss and moan elsewhere cuck
wow,removed,you want a medal or something what makes you so special that you need a thread
wow,removed,no what does that mean
wow,removed,you have reading comprehension problems dont you fucking retard this comment that you are replying to is in regards to a user claiming that blizzard was intentionally deceiving its player base to make money stay on topic idiot
wow,removed,
wow,removed,no asshole learn how claims work you said they told you to fuck off when they did no such thing then you linked the qa as proof only to have it show that they are implementing your crybaby bitch changes and not ignoring you as you claim naw bruh your sensitive ass took we should have listened sooner as bawww theyre ignoring my special snowflake ass piss off with your entitlement
wow,removed,no im fairly certain youre just an asshole you dont understand the effort some people put into farming because you have no problem dipping into someone elses bounty of course its going to seem easy if youre more than willing to wait for someone else to do all the work so you dont have to skins may be infinite but bos isnt and i need that just as much as i need the the skins same goes for the items that have a chance to drop if you have one of the shoulder enchantment the drop rate on that stuff is low enough as it is not being able to skin all that i pull only makes it worse every considered that they were farming in peace until some douchebag arrived and started pulling everything and then complaining about how they tagged their mobs lol nope becuase if i go to a spot to farm and someone else is already there doin their thing i just move on to different spot im not gonna fuck with someone else just to save myself some time i stand by what i said about you especially after reading youre reply to my comment just becuase you dont give a fuck about someone stealing from you doesnt make it okay to steal from someone else the mental gymnastics it takes to justify that kind of behavior is beyond me you think im egotiscial and overreacting i think youre lazy and annoying agree to disagree i guess

wow,removed,hahaha thanks for the laugh op did you just assume my gender is a meme its poking fun of nonbinary gender people who get triggered every time someone calls them heshe because they are actually a xeze or some shit basically mentally handicapped people in other words its just a joke dont worry about it
wow,removed,youre wrong most people that want it have already played the vanilla private servers and genuinely want it
wow,removed,flair mod
wow,removed,you forgot nazis
wow,removed,fml are you serious what a bunch of cucks this made icc so much less of a pain and i didnt even mind running it damn you blizz
wow,removed,ive got a strong feeling this has something to do with what illidan says in the new nighthold cinematic his last words are now mortals follow me into the abyss on another note prepare for a wall im calling it right now quote me on this or depending on the release dates of the patches will have us going to argus if only a small area of it and the last raid of the expac will likely be either an old god boss that found its way onto the planet that or we fight a weakened form of sargeras as a trial to see if the titan egg azeroth is able to be protected by us random people on azeroth from the old god corruption which leads to him not destroying azeroth this leads into the next expac where we either defend against a void lord that manages to make his way into our universe alongside sargeras wishful thinking or future speaking
wow,removed,clearly you dont know that relics can drop for offspecs lol fucking idiot
wow,removed,agree also private server tends to have the same tight knit community that normal wow preinterservers

wow,removed,dont even cross out your name anymore blizzards client has built in facebook streaming which doesnt block out names so why would you do it in a screenshot
wow,removed,httpsyoutubehznanlfpwq
wow,removed,all it takes to summon a gm is a few stupid remarks about a third gender and attack helicopters
wow,removed,i dont expect a trump supporter to ever understand any nuance or historical context
wow,removed,its about looting them not equipping
wow,removed,
wow,removed,what does the number of bosses or item level have to do with anything its not a raid its a dungeon
wow,removed,because if you already have but not your good ones you will likely be benched for progression
wow,removed,getting benched isnt fun neither is having shit legendarys
wow,removed,of course it doescan you read having your bis legendarys vs not having them can be dpswhich simply means benchtime
wow,removed,how is the truth arrogant its simply a fact that a with good stats is better than for example the shit absorbneckwhere the hell is your problem if people care about their dps
wow,removed,wheres your prove that you can get provide it then
wow,removed,nobody knows it as afaik nobody has on one char
wow,removed,this along with the action camera is a glimpse at console wow

wow,removed,im on mobile so i cant see everything
wow,removed,
wow,removed,
wow,removed,wowheadcom
wow,removed,you dont need gear to pvp its all about the skill now once you join a pvp instance your and everybody elses stats are set to a predetermined template which is spec specific to assure that everyone is on the same field and youre not getting melted by people with thrice your hp and the damage pvp gear now is mainly cosmetic and the only difference between someone who just started pvping and someone with full gladiator gear will be something like a power increase instead of the old this was such a good change that pvp feels fresh and fair now hell ive been a pver for all my life but in legion i will definitely play some pvp
wow,removed,gay but motivating
wow,removed,now if you wanted to say that is what i said there wouldnt be an issue there isnt an issue theres a pretentious dickhead who thinks my fun is wrong
wow,removed,over reactive wow cry baby basically
wow,removed,
wow,removed,man youre retarded
wow,removed,pet taunts and garrison bodyguards the bane of any tanks existence especially on world bosses me two days ago hey maybe dont be a fucking retard and point the boss away from the raid hey maybe direct your insults at the folks whose bodyguards and pets i watched taunt then get melted please put those away everyone
wow,removed,i just made it into the login they officially announced a ddos this also after they banned a bunch of users from overwatch they claimed they would ddos in retaliation
wow,removed,hahahaha retard
wow,removed,first of all it isnt a scam second of all they know this is possible already
wow,removed,hes a ret that has to farm the shit out of vault no he doesnt dont be a fucking retard
wow,removed,cthun was literally impossible
wow,removed,hfc was pretty clearly cobbled together from assets used in brf and later in legion some of the fights were pretty good though
wow,removed,yeah i was actually really keen for this one sadly didnt have time to check out the scarab one either lets hope the next event is cool
wow,removed,the mages of the kirin tor made some arcane miscalculations when planning their tavern crawl the tavern crawl is cancelled khadgar sends his apologies stop fucking things up khadgar plz
wow,removed,oh god this makes me so sad
wow,removed,seems mighty hypocritical of you folks wtf is hypocritical about this situation
wow,removed,yeah they were decent fights for the most part but truly nothing special nighthold has a lot of really cool bosses the time mechanics in particular really get me going
wow,removed,i love how there is always some salty guy in the comments talking about how little he gives a shit while bitching in the same thread he apparently doesnt care for
wow,removed,lmao they just did you the biggest favor ever by kicking you no one should have to raid with autistic shitheads like them find a new guild live long and raid well
wow,removed,according to armory you are still in your guild httpusbattlenetwowencharacterthralleverfreesimple also looking at the logs from your guldan fight you never afkd whats the deal
wow,removed,op is a big fat phony
wow,removed,he was also there for pulls after apparently being kicked
wow,removed,how do you explain logs showing you there for pulls after you were apparently kicked
wow,removed,tanks autstic sceeching
wow,removed,have you even looked at the logs why are you mindlessly defending him without reviewing the information it clearly shows him going afk on the pull like he said but then also shows him present for more pulls after that
wow,removed,stop mindlessly defending op without looking at the information yourself it clearly shows him afk on the pull like he said but also present for more pulls after that
wow,removed,yes and he was still present for more attempts after the one where he was supposedly kicked
wow,removed,i think his story checks out albeit a few details were wrong yet you didnt even look at the information provided yourself you just mindlessly defend op the logs clearly show him afk on the pull and also present for more pulls after that
wow,removed,but you havent even seen the logs you literally have no clue what you are talking about the logs clearly show full proper pulls the one is where op went afk and then there are more pulls after that sorry for being harsh but if you havent even seen the information we are discussing there is no point commenting
wow,removed,what other comments if you look at the logs it clearly shows op is either totally full of shit or at least embellishing the story
wow,removed,i love how much you assume with so little information ops story has already contradicted with the logs anyway so why believe a word he says
wow,removed,his logs and wow profile have been removed pretty much showing that he is lying up there actually they were probably removed due to the witchhunting rules on reddit while they were up i saw the name of his guild and tracked them down just got done talking to an officer he said that op was never gkicked or ignored by anyone just removed for a single pull due to being afk in other words op is a total karmawhore
wow,removed,actually look through the comments op is a lying shithead
wow,removed,op is a liar check my other comments
wow,removed,op is a liar check my other comments
wow,removed,they are situations that can happen regardless if a fake story or not the story is fake thats all that really matters here you are just hating on some boogeyman that doesnt exist
wow,removed,op is a liar check my other comments
wow,removed,op is a liar check my other comments
wow,removed,op is a liar check my other comments
wow,removed,i talked to a guild member of ops who confirmed he was never kicked or ignored just removed for one pull
wow,removed,sorry for being harsh but if you havent even seen the information we are discussing there is no point commenting you literally dont have enough information to comment on the situation i dont have a narrative i have facts the fact is that the logs dont match ops story you cannot comment on the logs as you have not seen them another fact is that i spoke with a guild member of ops and he confirmed that he wasnt kicked or ignored just removed for a single pull you can stop mindlessly defending him now i really dont know why you would comment defending him when you havet seen the evidence at all
wow,removed,oh god not again damn ulordtuts making bamboozling great again
wow,removed,pretty much i cant fault him for that though we are all drama queens at heart what i can fault him for is lying and playing a female panda
wow,removed,check the other comments op is a liar
wow,removed,check the other comments op is a liar
wow,removed,oh you mean like the logs that prove op is bullshit or the chat i had with his guild mate that proves op is bullshit how about the fact that his guild shows nobody leaving in the last week on wow progress no actually i have plenty of information to conclude that ops story is fake
wow,removed,nighthold has the best voice acting since icc not trying to dog the voice acting of other raids but for me nighthold has the most quotable and over the top voice acting in a while i particularly love spell blade with her one liners duplicate annihilate replicate so much passion
wow,removed,i love how he slowly gets more and more intense while delivering that line
wow,removed,
wow,removed,i dont know what i did but i know i deserve this beating
wow,removed,dont think anyone is directly his master likely whoever created his kind of mech i guess
wow,removed,tbh the only people that thought they would extend know nothing about the mythic race
wow,removed,na you cant but its fine tbh cant wait to see the results of this week of raiding
wow,removed,the ability cant crit at least from the wowhead spell info
wow,removed,because warrior tanks are goat i cant attend every raid in my guild so im not able to tank but i was one of the first warriors back in the day to understand critical block cap and how stamdodge were more beneficial after cap etc i miss those days not only did i constantly have guilds trying to poach me but i ever had other people applying to guilds pretending they were me wow ego has never been so inflated since
wow,removed,so you make a new lock and expect your guild to gear you up again
wow,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomusercarlwirkus my favourite disc priest to watch and learn from he puts out very good videos jak is a great priest on both specs but usually hes more holycentric as for your logs i only looked at the trilliax fight briefly before class but it looks like youre not using power wordshield nearly enough it needs to be cast on cooldown shadow mend usage feels a little high as well purge the wicked uptime could be better it depends on the size of your raid i suppose but i feel like your plea usage is quite high as well for people are you finding mana management difficult honestly it just seems like your overall timing in general could use a bit of work it doesnt seem like youre getting enough atonements out for certain phases make sure to properly prepare for raidwide damage phases and respond accordingly
wow,removed,too late
wow,removed,us east coast you have a problem with that
wow,removed,america a fascist police state stoned underage drunk driver charges
wow,removed,you obviously care or you wouldnt have used your less than stellar iq to post explain something obvious and then assume wrong carry on
wow,removed,i just added to what was a bad post honestly it couldnt get worse
wow,removed,tell them they are useless pieces of garbage that only deserve to live in a dumpster and eat nothing but scraps and feces for the rest of their life then spit on all of them and leave the guild thats what ive found most effective
wow,removed,yes it does you shitbiscuit you claim that you can make tons of money flipping mats into gear on the ah with any profession you cant do that indefinitely with bs with bloods due to the fact that you cannot buy bloods
wow,removed,hahah better at life and wow get mad bud
wow,removed,there is worthless and irrelevant shit posted all over this sub but you can tell the insecure people because they cant handle someone elses success
wow,removed,im guessing you know nothing about world first raiding
wow,removed,it is very highly unlikely that guldan is either bugged or numerically impossible
wow,removed,its the last boss of a mythic raid tier it doesnt take much to figure out he is very difficult
wow,removed,u mad bro
wow,removed,oh i think i got you mixed up with the other guy that said just because theyre the last boss of a mythic raid doesnt mean that theyre super difficult xavius which is why i said raid tier not just raid
wow,removed,they could at least enable it on lfr for alts once you have finished it once or make the questline accountwide
wow,removed,rwow in a nutshell
wow,removed,we can assume that it has to do with a possessed illidan thanks to datamining and the dj on the ptr
wow,removed,no the mythic version for archimonde isnt canon actually even the devs arent sure which version really is or whether or not they want to bring him back regardless he should die properly in both the mythic and normal endings of that fight due to how felfucked tanaan is
wow,removed,ive never had a problem with fel rush sooo sucks to be you
wow,removed,yeah and make sure she fits under your desk this time
wow,removed,and did you think i was trying to be nice
wow,removed,hes saying as an individual griffin mcelroy is a good dude if you dont want to support the website then why are we even having this conversation youve made up your mind
wow,removed,tbh fam you were the one name calling plenty of people managed to look at my post without freaking out but you just had to make a comment letting me know what you thought of me maybe look at your own actions before being critical of others
wow,removed,whats with the bad boy attitude its a good guide but the silliness and badass attitude come off as lame
wow,removed,yeah this is cool to teenagers i guess
wow,removed,its a jokenot a dick dont take it so hard its a commentnot a dick dont take it so hard
wow,removed,maybe it made you aware that i can have an opinion that differs can share it and you can not take it so hard dumbass
wow,removed,op answered you didnt need to go suck his dick too
wow,removed,yes but see your mom is the joke
wow,removed,very original leave never heard that sentiment by anyone on the webs before you fucking genius
wow,removed,polygon get that shit out of here

wow,removed,watch plz
wow,removed,hold the door
wow,removed,theres the white boy
wow,removed,hold the door
wow,removed,if you dont want the advice of critics go ahead and waste your money on terrible movies like an idiot thats your prerogative nobodys going to stop you you sound like a fucking retard if i enjoyed the movie it isnt a waste of money transformers was voted to be terrible but its a movie ive paid to see times its amazing what opinions mean eh
wow,removed,nice post fuckin retard
wow,removed,modern day journalism fuck having something tangible or insightful to write about nah lets rattle some cages and the stir the pot some more
wow,removed,out of the three specs unholy currently feels like the redheaded step child to me frost is just so well put together now and blood kinda feels like it did in the ol arpen days of wrathslow hard hitting cleave life drain except now youre a tank then unholy is there and its like are you a summoner are you a caster are you a dot class blood and frost got a lot of abilities stripped because they quote wanted to focus on class fantasy but unholy kept so much i would have preferred had they entirely focused on diseases festering wounds
wow,removed,well the only positive thing about this entire thing is i know youll be upset in months when they finally get rid of the casual shit show called ashran and youre forced to actually use you cds properly and not just barrel in and think that youre a military strategist for yelling at players to go to of zones also tldr on kicking its good you should probably put it on your bars here soon its not glorious its simple just think your shitty opinion is contributing to another downfall of another blizzard game you enjoy enjoy having autism and making what i can only assume is a shitty uniformed emotion based political vote this year as well
wow,removed,guardians been spewing sjw shit for a while no surprise
wow,removed,same here movie is good but they aint giving the wowcodes

wow,removed,blind fury i see what you did there
wow,removed,are you stupid you cant do worlds at dipshit
wow,removed,tags are the faggiest things in the entire world theyre basically the opposite of funny as if its a nsfw tag or some shit like someone is going to accidentally open something funny and be disgusted or worse as if something funny needs to be labeled as funny to be funny its just sad
wow,removed,i think this analysis touches on one of the problems with the narrative differentiating the orcs its not made very clear at the outset that there might be orcs with whom we can sympathize we are introduced to durotan and there is some banter with his wife but the orcs are so unlike us that its hard to find a way to like any of them even if there might be a good or noble one or two i dont remember them employing the save the cat technique in order to secure in our minds that durotan was a good guy that he was someone for whom we should root i think it would have been better to start the story with the human beings because they are much more like us its a point of entry that would let a wider audience have a chance at connecting with the story right away
wow,removed,rwow more like wow i cant believe you nerds still waste your lives playing this game get a real hobby like kayakfishing sword collecting crocheting or anything thats actually real nerd
wow,removed,was wondering if maybe i could have that voucher i have been cheking this reddit because i want to try the game but im outside us so theaters here doesnt give a free game only if u still have it or u are not giving to them thanks
wow,removed,if anyone interested i am currently trading and selling codes ive given a lot away and sorry if i didnt give you one i have gotten way too many messages anyway if your willing to trade or buy them message me or reply
wow,removed,i wouldnt care because its a video game i was rly rly bad when i started playing way back when and do you think people coddled and babied me then lmfao fuck no if you get upset and want to quit because some random retard youll never see again in a dungeon was mean to you then maybe the internet and social interaction just isnt for u my man but ya keep babbying new players and giving them a shit ton of gold in handouts that definitely doesnt create rly shit level that the rest of us have to deal with
wow,removed,regis philbin and kelly ripa more like kelly rip a fat blunt holla

wow,removed,but unfortunately he is clueless and retarded
wow,removed,what who would donate to this you do not list any organization or how the funds will be used guess i should start a donation page and be like cancer bad give me money if you agree same concept here
wow,removed,has been sitting at his computer all day his piss jugs are full and mummy is about to bring down some more cheetos he ponders about his life is my life pathetic he asks himself hes in denial thinking about his plans to try community college again for the third year in a row he curses old republican voters for his lack of success in his life he decides that maybe he could productively spend his time with activism he wants to stick it to the man perhaps some sort of protest against republicans but he struggles to figure out what he can do he begins to feel helpless doomed to failure in life just because old people just arent feeling the bern then all of a sudden he gets a great idea he crafts a custom meme to share to reddit to mentally masturbate along with thousands of equally superior minds he makes the meme posted here sits back smirks and decides that maybe hes done enough internet activism for one day and comes to the conclusions that he has worked hard enough for his bihourly fap he opens his porn folder clicks on the hentai section and happily deathgrips his dick while screeching at his mom who dares open his basement door to ask him when hes going to get a job
wow,removed,you should delete this post very very quickly if you want to keep what you gained but it may be too late
wow,removed,autism at its finest
wow,removed,cuck
wow,removed,look your shit up before spewing ignorance this is why your post got no attention and down votes you have no clue and claim someone who is educated has no idea what they are talking about gg kiddo look up some of the recorded interviews with blizz devs and look at world top tier teams you will see a healer and a tank in fuck outta here with your ignorance and extra chromosomes
wow,removed,delete wowexe
wow,removed,poop stains

wow,removed,bro get away from the keyboard and pick up a gun put the barrel in your mouth and pull the trigger save us from your dumbass rhetoric you will not be missed bro just do it lol
wow,removed,insulting people who dont worship a talentless hack that preschool bit must have been projecting its no surprise you cant for the life of you defend him with an actual argument i would suggest offing yourself since it would be a favor to the rest of us but i doubt you could figure out how now go play in traffic
wow,removed,you seem like one of those safe space college kids that took and now you feel like you know something seriously the world does not need any more people like you do us all a favor and off yourself you will not be missed
wow,removed,nope dont need anything from you but if you decided to off yourself i wouldnt lose any sleep over it hell would anyone lose sleep over that
wow,removed,thats why you have a guild in a mmorpg
wow,removed,ive gotten to the point where i dont accept dh tanks in my mythic runs
wow,removed,those tigers are fucking overpowered in mythic
wow,removed,which guy
wow,removed,we had minutes left no death at all and people with overall dps and a warrior tank
wow,removed,maw of souls is easier i agree
wow,removed,the easiest how could dark heart be easier than for example maw
wow,removed,ah yes different perspectives i guess dark heart can actually be hard to heal trash mobs deals a lot
wow,removed,you are too retarded to breed never have children
wow,removed,youre so full of shit im and i can barely tank two of those mobs at a time why are brm apologist posts always filled with hyperbolic garbage
wow,removed,lol you mad bro
wow,removed,just dont stand in the bellowing corruption and youre fine

wow,removed,ebay or griegs list are solid if you hide the account details under after you get paid dont want screenshots of it before hand
wow,removed,subreddit rules posts or comments that explain or advocate for terms of service violations will be removed and multiple violations are grounds for a warning these include but are not limited to cheats and hacks buying or selling gold or accounts also blizzard can and will terminate the account if they catchsuspect that its been sold or traded
wow,removed,you know everything is set up for level right you know everything is centered around your artifact right you must be the only level with an artifact because only a complete fucking retard would be throwing a fit over their class when theyre missing a huge chunk of it
wow,removed,they didnt disappear they might have got slained by alliance scum morshan ramparts is always raped by alliance and noobs are dying like jews and all over
wow,removed,i think you mean grave
wow,removed,thats pretty amateur stuff you wouldnt be allowed in on any of my raids even if you paid me
wow,removed,hello i am william fitzgerald i am years old i will be dead soon i am using a computer i believe my son uses this website and i am looking for him please tell him i am looking for him i want to talk to him before i go
wow,removed,its a fine system mass reporting isnt going to happen to your average wow player unless you piss off the entire guild you are raiding with streamers have a much harder time and that sucks but as long as a gm reviews it within a day then it shouldnt be a problem maybe they could even add a grace period that if you get falsely silenced then you cant be silenced for a certain amount of days if they would also punish people for fake reporting that is even better tldr the system is fine but they just need to add more precautions
wow,removed,hands up dont mute wlm
wow,removed,i got silenced because sjws dont like the name of my guild thelsamar bunny ranch this is ridiculous the same tier of hyperoffended people are currently present on university campuses i may as well not talk in game ever because from this point forward no fun is allowed power has been transferred to the vocal minority and if you dont agree with them youre just wrong i even had multiple people whisper be pure fucking jibberish today so when i replied they could use the report feature on me
wow,removed,stormrage you probably recognize it from this httparchiveisocwbt
wow,removed,afaik thats where a certain thing will be after the broken shore scenario sp
wow,removed,an auto squelch that sent him an email that linked directly to the new silence feature and explained what it was fuck off
wow,removed,fuck that retard who thought this was a good idea great thing they want to create a safezone so desperately update blizzard
wow,removed,you can play on unofficialpirate servers which would still have the old belf model
wow,removed,i mean just because youre a wow gm doesnt mean you need the very highest standard of english there are tonnes of top businessmen that dont have a good grasp of grammar — it doesnt stop them plus if its in the eu then its probably not even their language
wow,removed,when you start by saying you guys are moaning you lost all your credentials to have an opinion if that confuses you go ask your parents how to have grown up conversations
wow,removed,dae hate le political correctness muh freedumb of speech le first amendyment says i can say anything i want and you sjw cucks cant do anything about it the only thing worse than overly sensitive crybabies are the crybabies crying about the overly sensitive crybabies
wow,removed,truly a scum that needs cleansing guilty until proven innocent ey fuck off
wow,removed,httpwwwtakeascreenshotorg
wow,removed,hes trying to be funny by making fun of sjw boogiemen that say everything is sexist
wow,removed,all the game needs is an ignore feature that works account wide if you dont want someone harassing you the silence feature is catering to cry babies sjws and people that cant handle the fact that people have different opinions
wow,removed,first of all you dont know the system is automated are you braindead watch the damn video i spoon fed you in the links above i am not going to waste my time watching whatever proof you are claiming because you cant definitively say that a gm didnt get a notification and click a temp mute youre not going to waste your time watching the proof because you know youre wrong the entire fanclub is out on damage control today with the most pathetic responses ive ever read if a gm got the report and read that a guy said i love world of warcraft and then temp muted him that gm should be fired end of story also its tldr before calling me an idiot try not to go full retard yourself wear a helmet next time spastic
wow,removed,you mean stab the baby in the face pee in the water and then make the dead baby drink the peewater through its ass
wow,removed,quit crying about it you fucking nerd
wow,removed,they went to the trouble of spoilertagging and you just blurt it out really
wow,removed,loot distribution should stay as a decision made by players not by system people have proven to be pieces of shit now the system steps in and prevents the bad behavior
wow,removed,found the sjw
wow,removed,nobody cares get outside and do something with your life
wow,removed,roleplaying lul
wow,removed,i also found a post where you disagree with the fact that islam is not a race i was right about you without even looking through your post history you are a regresive leftist saarkesian fan social justice warrior racist against white people no wonder your ilk support usch abusive measures
wow,removed,ive got a guide up on my site httpcranehealingblogspotcom mistweaving and fistweaving are competitive with one another and have different playstyles allowing a lot more flexibility in what role you fill for your healing roster it boils down to renewing mist on cooldown for light healing effuse for a bit more oomph in your healing for single target and enveloping mist if you really need to save someone vivify especially with uplifting trance procs from rem for group healing making sure to cast it on the lower health people for your mastery to heal essence font for mass group damage followed up with either effusevivifyrem casts for double mastery heals
wow,removed,thats not the point we live in an sjw world today and i personally fucking hate it i cant change it i might as well embrace it if there is enough outcry against discrimination against ai it wont have to be illegal
wow,removed,is this about tirion dieing and passing on ashbringer to the adventurer
wow,removed,just because i have a different opinion than you doesnt make you better than me i dont know where everyone is getting that notion from ive seen everything youve mentioned happen more than once personally i like the danger of not knowing who you can trust thats part of an adventure if somebody runs off with a piece of loot or wigs out in vent its not the end of the world the sun will still rise in my opinion all the crossrealm stuff and autogrouping is what created the anti community master race that now seems to have the loudest voice in all issues concerning wow before that stuff was implemented you had to group with like minded people or you never ever find a group that was any good because everybody knew you were a scumbag the problem solved itself so you go on ahead and keep calling everything you dont like toxic and use the old rose colored glasses cliche like it automatically validates everything you say after it it doesnt really bother me but please dont act like it makes you absolutely correct or puts you on a pedestal its just your opinion nothing more
wow,removed,rping you dont want to do that you think you do but you dont blizzard
wow,removed,as someone from a low pop server orgrimmar is now unphased and it looks so awesome to see everyone standing around
wow,removed,again you state your own opinion as a casual raider as if theyre facts when theyre mostly just not true you cant be highly rewarded as a spriest this is is how its been for most of its lifetime your opinion theres nothing to refine and when it comes to movement you can sure say goodbye to anything more than stacks of lingering insanity already proven wrong in the first day of prepatch feel free to look at any log on warcraftlogs theres no skill in mashing vbmb mf to the point where youre not looking at a cast bar or cooldowns and just hoping you keep your insanity above theres skill in learning how to play your class in a boss fight under the constraints of that class while maximizing your dps and minimizing your damage taken the apm required by the player to legitimately push themselves to their optimum is insane theres a lot to be said about cop but saying the its a high apm rewarding spec is ridiculous i genuinely have no idea where you came up with that
wow,removed,id die too if i had prydaz
wow,removed,click on advanced so we can properly shit on his gear please
wow,removed,gnome hunter on moon guard he wont be missed

wow,removed,lol get triggered some more loser hilarious youre so unlovable that you literally have no one for major holidays youre supposed to spend with loved ones you have none of those youre a loser and thats all youll ever amount to
wow,removed,what in saying is that presumably there are times of the day when you dontcant play what is it that they say about assuming if i could not play at the time i get ak i would complete these quests now i am lodging my petty complaint because this incentivizes me to play at a time when although i can play then it is less optimal the game is giving me a choice between do this now and feel bad about losing out on artifact power do this later and feel bad because im sacrificing something else that i would prefer to do at that time its a loselose its not a nice design to offer players loselose situations when theres no necessity for this design the game could just align research completion to the daily reset which would reduce of the problem and now lets get to you you motherfucker are arguing this just in order to be a wiseass there is no benefit to your arguing you are not making a constructive suggestion what youre saying is not useful youre simply being annoyed because i suggested a way to improve the game thats all there is you are annoyed that im suggesting something fuck you because you are a fucking moron
wow,removed,lmao class design in vanilla was shit now i know why your first post was bs
wow,removed,i hope you fucking die
wow,removed,mm hunter and nothing of value was lost
wow,removed,want to pvp choose another game top pvpers are currently fighting with blizz with blizz being quiet as usual as for winrate im afraid there will be a severe flux due to the fallout with pvp players so that cannot currently be answered im seriously considering selling my account because of it overwatch is more fun to me personally anyhow race has no real advantage anymore orc or human are the main pvp races though jaina is an uppity cunt and i cant talk about the king without giving a spoiler oh wait you already know about it the new king is a passive little shitsimilar to trudeau but worse i like the new warchief a lot but some folks cant seem to appreciate her not really some models got updated but nothing substantial or even worth mention
wow,removed,holy shit there really is a preachy attention whore who does this in every gaming subreddit kill yourself

wow,removed,ive clearly never raided mythic im clearly a whining child with no valid opinions yeah nah try again kid
wow,removed,please change the font from porky jesus
wow,removed,no one gives a fuck autism bot
wow,removed,cucked for years
wow,removed,stop trying to be hwhite you liberal cuck
wow,removed,i mean its all made up isnt it p i think theres some confusion here im not saying its bad in any way per se i actually thought it was a good bit of world building at the time the sort of selfdeprecating issue that i was trying to poke at is that a lot of wow players somewhat understandably arent exactly what you would call socially progressive whether there actually exists a mental link between people believing an in game magically enhanced genetic change and believing in the same theories that got us to no irish no blacks no dogs is questionable i just think its a bit of a sad reflection p
wow,removed,the real question is why are you trying to argue with someone whos clearly a sjw oh no someone was racist on the internet the sort of selfdeprecating issue that i was trying to poke at is that a lot of wow players somewhat understandably arent exactly what you would call socially progressive yup i was right
wow,removed,no one asked you
wow,removed,well that is actually hilariousa guy needed more gold to pay for a coin to keep his sub going i offered to pay it if he added me on bnet and tried to pay me back he was super nice about it so i figured maybe we can play some bgs too or whateverthats not how it actually works if you buy a service via gold and accept to the terms in chat so blizzard can check it afterwards youll get your gold or items back of the time if the other part does not fulfill it what white guy somethings not quite right
wow,removed,nolifes lol
wow,removed,so true story here only opposite ending i moved took the chance to move to florida to live with a buddy i played wow with for about years he didnt play all through but we were always in contact so i moved there and all was well until long story short heroin heroin everywhere he did so much heroin that he wiped his spoon with a hanes white tshirt and when he was finally evicted the fucking shirt was black was a horrible ordeal
wow,removed,how is it not obvious who the white guy is what am i missing
wow,removed,fuck him pussy
wow,removed,did you just assume its gender
wow,removed,personally i find it boring for some reason if were talking just numbers its doing okay though technically behind fire or arcane on every nh fight last i checked that being said there is a variation of the glacial spike build that makes use of fof procs thats fairly hushhush one great post about it on altered time but even that guy keeps his logs private though he provides a decent tutorial and shows a few numbers it benefits immensely from traits due to the doubledipping nature of glacial spike benefits from extra fb damage and from extra gs damage so it roughly doubles any flat damage bonus seems completely absurd on cleave of targets and very very good single target but again its experimental and the masters of the spec are keeping mostly quiet worth looking into if you feel like searching for the unicorn mage or like hipster specs if its as good as they say it could really pay off
wow,removed,no i too have proved my worth odyn i am god king skovald these mortals dare not challenge my claim to the aegis
wow,removed,i cant believe youve done this
wow,removed,you should go through the proper youtube channels for them to decide whether there is infringement and take appropriate action
wow,removed,op reminds me of oversensetive tumblr people have you considered he was being sarcastic with i dont need to say please or perhaps since it is a shadow priest and one of their stupid mechanics to do amazing dps is to go for the talent that makes them die at the end of their burst which they usually end up using on the last few on the boss have you considered just doing your job as a healer and throwing a ress his way moral of the store dont be an oversensetive bitch and expect this whole everyone has to behave and be nice to eachother kindergarden nonesense
wow,removed,
wow,removed,did you know that swans can be gay
wow,removed,remindme hours
wow,removed,you know when some americans say all muslims are terrorists thats you right now also there are so many factors to this for example and foremost you had different dps players i presume they affect the amount of healing the healer can distribute on you and futhuremore the way you control the mobs often correlate with how much damage they take this creates a downward spiral the dps is low and players take excessive amounts of dmg you get less healing and are about to die you start to kite and trash spread and gets more casts and cleaves on players the dps is reduced and you get even less healing
wow,removed,sorry i didnt realize i was dealing with retards
wow,removed,i love hillary yaaaaas queeeen khaleeesi is comming to westeros im with her
wow,removed,is it
wow,removed,what is your in game name that might help us decide how hard to troll you

wow,removed,no
wow,removed,nah
wow,removed,cant afford wow better start playing a game that requires a sub get your shit together
wow,removed,kindly fuck right off
wow,removed,besides losing what do i gain

wow,removed,fucking aids why did you upload it when you knew nobody with a brain wants this shit
wow,removed,and youre here because
wow,removed,until the shit stains in america manage to kill the boss then we might stop posting these kills everyone knows us suck balls
wow,removed,this is the most retarded comment i have ever read please stop writing stupid things thank you
wow,removed,we would like to dedicate a special thanks to the following coffee machine
wow,removed,midwinter just got us third mythic helya congrats oceanic is on us servers you dipshits
wow,removed,youre being intentionally retarded conflating gearing something that is farmable with ap which is not thanks to ak and youre acting like youve accomplished this great feat by logging in every few days since the expansion wow guys round of applause you really stared down the face of adversity
wow,removed,is thrall muslim
wow,removed,please shut up honestly blizzard listen way to much at people like you so please just shut up
wow,removed,oof how does it feel to make this much of an ass out of yourself
wow,removed,enjoying warlock and thinking its balanced only gets you downvotes ill copy paste my blasted comment on my thoughts as a very progressed mythic raider who is happy with warlock mostly because it shows that your opinion is not worth discussing thinking that warlock are fine is dumb
wow,removed,lmao this is why people get angry when someone try to defend the state of warlocks because the only someone could do it is by being a lying retard like you
wow,removed,it has nothing to do with compassion of course it does it has everything to do with compassion everything youve just described to me shows that all these guilds care about is progression they dont give a shit about the individuals behind the keyboard guilds have a right to be this ruthless of course but it kills the social aspect of this game completely when people only care about their own progression when it comes to choosing between taking equally skilled players but one has better gear you are simplifying the issue far beyond what it is what if the lower geared player is the one who has been loyal to the guild for a while and helped a lot with progression whereas the lucky one with the legendary only shows up when their partner is out of town what if youd be able to down the boss with either choice would you really choose the higher ilvl simply for a slightly easier ride for yourself i can understand wanting things as easy as possible but having that sort of culture in a guild doesnt seem remotely social and just reeks of selfishness ultimately the bosses in this game can be defeated without the legendaries people only require them to make up for their own shortcomings its that simple you might think why does this bother frobalt so much the answer is that ive seen far too much whining about people not getting legendaries because people are acting like they are absolutely necessary to finish content while at the same time also being harsh on people who dont have legendaries it just reeks of hypocrisy to me i just wish people would stop whining legendaries were obviously put in this expac as something that is nice to find not something that should be absolutely necessary to down content
wow,removed,and free karma amirite
wow,removed,overflow is literally the easiest affix even for the healers its basically nonexistent youre probably not competent enough
wow,removed,i want to rape her
wow,removed,honestly couldnt tell you did a joint exercise with the jgsdf a few years back and they were super excited to show me their ffxiv characters the guild im in on proudmoore consists of at least japanese nationals its just tough trying to organize groups like this due to individual obligations and guild size
wow,removed,how the hell do you know about tradeskillmaster but dont know how to take a screenshot you should be ashamed of yourself
wow,removed,ask support if they can refund btw you are moron those prcies are obviously off
wow,removed,my guilds raid team has females my guilds gm is a female this just isnt true in fact our teams strats are taken from properbird a woman
wow,removed,what is weird though the guys in my guild still harass her like she is bad but when in reality she is sooooo much better than them its not weird they are assholes
wow,removed,i think you might spend too much time on tumblr
wow,removed,probably a mixture of different things far less girls playing the game than guys far less girls willing to spend the amount of time need to raid at a higher level compared to guys its certainly not a matter of skill the girl in our guild is one of our strongest dps on the priest discord there are girl players who are very respected when it comes to theorycrafting
wow,removed,because there isnt a kitchen in emerald nightmare okay jokes aside i think maybe its just because more guys play in general than girls ive been playing with an increasing number o girls theyre becoming more represented what is weird though the guys in my guild still harass her like she is bad but when in reality she is sooooo much better than them guys do that to each other too my guild does it all the time enter my raid leader and a rogue friend well im sure i could scrape up a dps better than you if i needed to yeah i could scrape up something better than you too just by scratching my ass everyone laughed everyone heckles each other sometimes more densely than others and the last thing most chicks want is to be treated differently just because shes a girl
wow,removed,you are hopeless
wow,removed,who cares what gender you are or race for that matter if you perform you are good if not then you are bad and that should be the end of it i dont think anyone should care whether if the top guild having less female representation especially when the majority of them does not want to play that avidly or hardcore
wow,removed,dont assume my gender you fucking moron
wow,removed,because most of us have more going for us in our lives that isnt an excuse to be terrible at a simple game
wow,removed,okay then if it isnt why does using mastercard ask for confirmation and your bnet password tool
wow,removed,its not relevant to the op but it is a genuine concern not like reddit never strays off topic
wow,removed,that would be by choice
wow,removed,oh wow someone left their gaming laptop open unlocked and unattended in a public space i know im gonna log into hearthstone and buy a bunch of packs with their paypal account fucking idiot
wow,removed,we need to take a step back and recognize the situation for what it is yeah the situation is that i have had shit luck with rng while other guys from my guild who have played less are rolling in tf gear get fucked op the rng complaint is valid and youre being a dick
wow,removed,thats what i said yet everyone here is adamant that you dont have to enter bnet password for confirmation when you use paypal i dont use paypal so i dont know who is right but if it does ask for confirmation then i dont know why i get downvoted and if it doesnt i still think it should
wow,removed,huh well i never said it showed the price all i said was that you have to confirm it then one idiot said you dont and then when i said that it is illogical that anyone can buy things when you use paypal without needing to confirm everyone bitched at me fuck this subreddit
wow,removed,that box will be in settings then because its not under the pw box that im sure of
wow,removed,im pretty sure they banned flying in legion this guy is clearly hacking by using his flying mount in dalaran
wow,removed,it you hate it when this happens you cant just hate at nothing
wow,removed,i didnt say i did i it im simply saying that i know people who have done it most likely they did profession and class hall quests along with it please refrain from being a massive dick when in one sentence someone invalidated your min written bullshit
wow,removed,wtf does that even mean ignore the subject damn troll
wow,removed,never seen it still it seemingly is a purely manual thing nothing that accidentally couldve been turned off
wow,removed,retaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaards
wow,removed,youve been able to do that since cata
wow,removed,dont worry youre both assholes
wow,removed,remind me hours
wow,removed,as it should be only virgins play blood dk or any sort of tank spec in pvp
wow,removed,i demand perfection
wow,removed,youre putting the pussy on a pedastool you will be severely disappointed with any legendary you get because none of them are as amazing as you apparently think they are at ilvl you can run heroic en and do for guaranteed ilvl upgrades tomorrow night youll be able to do kara there are plenty of upgrades you can get without even taking into consideration of getting lucky with warforged items
wow,removed,he didnt at all say that top spec went from top to last the statement is that when you move spec from the bottom it puts another spec at the bottom and then complaints about that spec show up youre the stupidest poster ive ever seen
wow,removed,this literally gets said every expansion yet you are still playing you stupid fuck
wow,removed,at work have internet filters can you post a transcript of the notes
wow,removed,why is it removed upload it now
wow,removed,if you want to have fun playing dont swap to arms unless you find buttons with tons of downtime fun
wow,removed,hes a lawyer not a game designer he doesnt know what fun is stop taking things away from us you crappy company were sick of zone limtations for toys and items continent limits water limits mount limits no not limits actually games are supposed to be fun
wow,removed,hunters has always been a pretty skilless class remember this expansion is about class identity they hit the nail on the head stupid easy good numbers
wow,removed,the damage of all shadow priest abilities has been reduced to compensate for this resulting in no net gain or loss of damage sooo we got some flavor changes
wow,removed,oh you mean thefuckening
wow,removed,with that logic i bet you think hillary clinton would make a great president p
wow,removed,nah i think brack gets his jollies off shitting on people who want legacy servers
wow,removed,if you dont like rtb use the talent that exists for specifically not using rtb its not viable fuck off unless you have numbers to prove that it is
wow,removed,well i just unsubbed pvp for arms is going to suck really bad
wow,removed,these rose tinted goggled players just need to move on with the times vanilla wasnt hard it was just grindy and unpolished but nostalgia makes people forget that dont waste your time blizzard will shut this down in two weeks tops
wow,removed,so ignorant lol
wow,removed,hi heres a summary of what an ad hominem is httprationalwikiorgwikiargumentumadhominem from the latin to the person is an informal logical fallacy that occurs when someone attempts to refute an argument by attacking the source making it rather than the argument itself the fallacy is a subset of the httprationalwikiorgwikigeneticfallacy as it attacks the source of the argument which is irrelevant to to the truth or falsity of the argument an ad hominem should not be confused with an insult which attacks the person but does not seek to rebut the persons argument
wow,removed,thats so arrogant and condescending yet still completely false the community thing while true is just one of many things we prefer about vanilla the game itself even with its own large list of issues is still vastly better than retail as an mmo in a living world you arrogant yet clueless zealots luckily not all of you here keep repeating that while our community grows larger every day despite the adversaries we have to put up with to play the game we love
wow,removed,why are people here so edgy mad we enjoy vanilla wow with its flaws because it implies something is wrong with retail
wow,removed,what you dont miss awful flight paths and mounts until you get rich is a pretty edgy nonargument against vanilla my point stands its not a comment made to incite discussion at all
wow,removed,this attitude is one of the reasons legacy servers have such a bad rep he never said you couldnt enjoy or play legacy servers but you decided to be confrontational about it anyways grow up this attitude is one of the reasons why people are making comments like why a re people here so edgy
wow,removed,the people who want to play vanilla wow isnt even on blizzards radar of fucks to give
wow,removed,do you want a medal or something you arent special anybody can learn to drive stick shift the point he was making is exactly that there is zero reason to drive a stick other than to be a snobby holier than thou asshole like yourself
wow,removed,rofl that is an absolutely minuscule amount of players you people are even more delusional than i thought
wow,removed,so whats the name of the new server
wow,removed,you cant just claim to know what people like and then state it like it is a fact sorry but thats the kind of thing that only complete idiots do there are plenty of people who like the actual gameplay more than on live me included
wow,removed,lol down voted for having a good time man people are so shitty im glad youre having fun
wow,removed,you have to be literally brain dead to die to that lag wasnt why you died your just trash
wow,removed,there are so many misconceptions in this thread the demand is not for vanilla wow it is for free wow lets be honest how many of you would pay this company stealing blizzards content dollars a month people just want a free to play wow and thats fine in a way but dont disguise it the community issue is a non issue too the game is what you make it if you join vanilla and so what youre doing in legion guess what you will still be lonely there are plenty of community left but it wont drop in your lap and it doesnt happen over night which most people think you log on and they throw you a parade
wow,removed,im sorry are you triggeredddd
wow,removed,welcome to getting downvoted by the casuals wow has to offer now
wow,removed,the thin skin theory fits the downvoting hah
wow,removed,careful wow players have a tough time handling things with common sense theyd rather complain to blizz that they dont have enough safe space slots to use so that they can pretend theyre playing a single player game
wow,removed,what a fake ass video you didnt spend hours to load dalaran
wow,removed,nope just stating facts such as youre a dick d
wow,removed,wow private servers httpswwwredditcomrwowservers
wow,removed,i know white people love talking behind peoples backs but can you give me the warlocks name so i can talk to him please dont protect his identity this isnt a private game
wow,removed,just the herps
wow,removed,stop talking behind peoples backs and automatically siding with the first person who brings you the story what if the warlock has something to say about it i want to know before i side with this guy here come more excuses even though im right
wow,removed,type in white people two face into google thats exactly whats going on here and i know the op is white you are all talking behind this groups back and wont let them defend themselves white people do that how do i know i is one
wow,removed,i play healer and i get invited ez gg noob cucks
wow,removed,idk i dont have time for it when i am on my rogue alt that used to be my main anymore anyways it doesnt benefit you much right i recently played a rogue on a vanilla server where you could pp quest items from mobs so good i was so surprised and it really felt good
wow,removed,yeah you seem like you need some laughter in your life did your dad hit extra hard today or whats up
wow,removed,what this makes no sense little man
wow,removed,take a deep breath and think about what youre saying these insults cut pretty deep fam

wow,removed,dont insult people when you dont genuinely mean it you disingenuous panda fucker post the info i cant wait to get you to admit youre dumb like i do every dumb redditor
wow,removed,i think my group was the first or the second group on the server to get this achi and some achievements are some of the most fun thing ive done in wow all year you should all try to get it
wow,removed,well now its probably because of the word cuck thats why i did at least
wow,removed,i was in a h en group yesterday the leader gave the tanks assists we killed ursoc and i got the bloodied bear fang blood relic he asked me for it since i had an relic i told him i was going to use it he told me there was no way i would and how full of crap i was i told him it has a better affix he kicked me from the group proceeded to whisper me calling me dumb and stuff because what retard would choose an affix over ilvl i told the leader he kicked me he invited me back i became a drama queen and called him a fa anyways the whole raid sided with me and called him toxic he got kicked of left or something but kept ranting me out lol i had to actually report him to mute him for some reason i cant believe the length he went to be toxic to me over my own personal loot like seriously man i got better stuff to do and you should too lol this was an prot warrior that literally wiped the raid like times on ursoc because he didnt taunt the debuff its almost entertaining but ill be honest i dont like the toxic chat
wow,removed,sorry but you are looking through rose colored glasses no stop go away that argument didnt work a few months ago and it damn sure wont work now
wow,removed,lol most people arent you mean into their early now you cant say you havent seen a full goth with a black horde tshirt in coffee shop at least one it happens to me a couple times actually in new york

wow,removed,im offended because mean things are said
wow,removed,judging by your flair you suck and thats all there is to it the gameplay is very fun obviously thats my opinion though and they very strong right now theyre probably about middle of the pack for raids but they are extremely fucking good for mythic dungeons like far and away the best
wow,removed,if youre on eu shoot me an pm with your battletag

wow,removed,ragnaros isnt a br server but i know what you mean
wow,removed,as someone playing on a brazillian server i hate most brazillians as well but i swear were all not like that okay
wow,removed,en is part of nh drops its that fucking simple dude you are straight up wrong and have gone on this massive rant about how you might be right but you are wrong it isnt getting removed
wow,removed,being contrarian for the point of being contrarian is absolutely a mistake
wow,removed,whether nighthold is considered another tier we already know it is a part of this tier there is no point arguing because you are dead wrong
wow,removed,blizzard stated that they are basing the first tier of legion of of wod i know you like to bitch and moan about wod being shit but raiding was one thing it did right not to mention they literally stated that brh was released too early and they didnt want to rush nh this time post all you want bring up anything you want it doesnt stop you being wrong
wow,removed,dude you are cherry picking his comment so fucking hard nighthold is not content it is literally in the game files right now waiting to be turned on just like wod
wow,removed,that isnt what spam is provide some evidence for what you say and people might actually take you seriously
wow,removed,check out my post above would like some insights there
wow,removed,if you mean funny in a sad and pathetic way then yes
wow,removed,i used to play dota a lot and found out that south americans often had better pings on american servers than south american servers so there ya go
wow,removed,on a scale of one to ten rogues are wait for it fucking dumb
wow,removed,no fuck of casual scrub
wow,removed,this fat fucc is leaning on her fat from the future she sure wont lose weight hahahaha

wow,removed,the guy sitting in middle front needs to come see me sometime
wow,removed,is this a joke or some weird racist bandwagon
wow,removed,i played on an ark survival evolved perth western australia server and we regularly had brazilians connecting with like ping no fucking clue why they came to our server of all places but holy fuck they were lunatics absolute lunatics
wow,removed,awesome job with the oger customes standing left and right
wow,removed,tell ian cameron says hi not in your guild just recognized my friend who works at blizz over there on the end
wow,removed,sims do not upkeep iv that long without shard of exodar or legendary gloves wow progress doesnt use simc the current frost apl for frost is completely able to be replicated in emerald nightmare encounters top end guilds are forcing members to either switch completely or gear both it legitimately is the single to two target spec for mage raiding fire is still preferred with low health add management mythic and bosses with any for of multiple priority target switching phases think ilgynoth or phase xavius the legendary system specifically enables fire arcane and frost to all be able to be competitive at a top end level
wow,removed,you wouldnt secure anything youre bad but hey if that somehow makes you feel accomplished go for it man
wow,removed,so many big people
wow,removed,no one discussing the white elefant on the room on this photo lul
wow,removed,if you have a macro program most gaming keyboard or mouse will do you can set it up to run overnight and just dont bother with the grind it took me nights doing it but i didnt have to stare at target dummies for hours
wow,removed,go fuck yourself
wow,removed,i see you have healers in your guild not a bad ratio for the in the photo lmao
wow,removed,will holinka be there then i might come and will not forget to take a barrel of gasoline and a lighter

wow,removed,wow you dont understand it is your opinion that i am being unreasonable are you retarded or something im trying to have a logical conversation all you do is name call and spout your opinion you have no data or logic to back up your opinions i dont know what else to tell you
wow,removed,i walk up to you slap you across the face and then begin furiously humping you
wow,removed,hahahahah wow so the cuck turns out to be a wow neckbeardthis is just too good hahaha
wow,removed,yea and how much content have you cleared if youve done less than mythic under time on wowprogress then stfu dude noone cares
wow,removed,i do understand that wasnt my point reading comprehension ftl
wow,removed,why even reply you fucking retard go fuck your mother
wow,removed,do you want to see how many buttons we use by comparison as a priest i had maybe different heals bound because we used to downrank based on situation and mana conservation
wow,removed,youre a retard man shut up
wow,removed,allakhazam casters realm and eqmaps were all legit sites when they were player run then some frigging company bought up allakhazam for pocket change and abused the zam logo to make a gaming site information hub empire that is yeah pretty cancer they all trigger my kapersky software suit like a sjw on womens pay
wow,removed,us
wow,removed,thats because they play casually
wow,removed,ok mom
wow,removed,youre assuming people want to play the game and have fun i want to compete at a top level thats the way i want to experience the game not everyone wants to be a casual please understand that
wow,removed,are you dumb i already listed everything you need to know not going to reveal my identity on here
wow,removed,you keep attacking me and my character without even knowing me again youre a retard go away
wow,removed,you almost got it but its more like ive run way more content than most people and have shit lucksniffle
wow,removed,if you understood the odds behind it you would realize that your statement certainly isnt true you dont even know the numbers though so some general explanation of basic statistics isnt helping the issue and all of you have horrible inference skills and missed the entire point of the post because youre all retards just like the fucks in my guild who cant do mechanics and try to parse because they think it means something
wow,removed,everyone fucking knows this learn to search
wow,removed,sounds like whining because you cant zerg through content
wow,removed,just look at below some people are just complete idiots that read some rando on a forum or reddit say disc priests are the worst and then decide theyre gonna kick every disc priest from their group
wow,removed,you are still trying to act like you play a class that requires skill gtfo you austisic cancer kid
wow,removed,

wow,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqcebccqenyg
wow,removed,nope if you know how to properly manage guild bank and selling not the mats but rather making flasks and space out your auctionssales lol moron
wow,removed,omg blizz like you guys got your fist fully up the anus of popular culture next thing you know theres gonna be a raid boss named stump or tromp or something like that and hes going to make the horde great again and we have to kill him because blizzard are a bunch of hillary supporters because their logo is blue so they are democrats
wow,removed,maybe you suck my dick
wow,removed,at carstobotscom you can choose your own avatar my handle is optimus prime so i am poised to become well popular
wow,removed,if people dont want to see talk about the election a good start would be stop making vague sky is falling references to it and stop calling everyone who didnt vote a certain way an idiot
wow,removed,httpswwwthebuddyforumcomhonorbuddyforumbansectionbanreports
wow,removed,easy life boys ill see you guys in months after a solid years of botting ive got a dream account dont regret a thing fuck spending that much time and effort on a game
wow,removed,yo so im a returning player looking to get back into wow i quit wow yesterday and was wondering what is the most op class to roll to currently is the game any better than the day before yesterday in terms of class balance
wow,removed,trumps first day
wow,removed,any idea where i can buy one of those bad touch dolls
wow,removed,lmao your tears feed us we rollin in the juicy dollarydoos got all those rares all your nerds dream of we will see you again in months for some more easy coin
wow,removed,just got my second legendary and now im banned oh well gg blizz gg rekt quote originally posted by mandori you should really read up on what a test release is retard shut up goon i know more about cheating then you i started cheating in with medal of honor allied assault my first dmw bypass with chams skins on fps im not going with you any further i know whats wrong and its not because of test stable release idiot if you keep talking about it im going to ignore you sorry as im done spending money on wow and this bot
wow,removed,because murder and honorbuddy are pretty much the same
wow,removed,and last but certainly not least httpswwwthebuddyforumcomhonorbuddyforumbansectionbanreports to see individual reports
wow,removed,wheres the boob shot
wow,removed,ive been responding in trade chat to the election with there must always be a lich king
wow,removed,because you are propably person that he tried to make to do something as simple as not standing on certain spot
wow,removed,thank you needed that
wow,removed,kill odyn again and dont dieask for a ress
wow,removed,half our raid had this issue in pug never did find solution hearthd and ran back and it still ports you to next phase of the raid i assume if anything in odyns chest for you it would be mailed but still very annoying
wow,removed,how do you die on odyn is a better question
wow,removed,same thing happened with our priest squad they surrendered to sadness and died right after odyn did and when they released spirit they were in phase with no way back i was able to summon them back to the phase area so they could turn in the quest but without a warlock to yank you back i dont think theres a way back to the first area right now
wow,removed,permaban should lead to suicide
wow,removed,alright thanks ill see if live chat can help and if not ill try to give them a call surprising there are only people on the entire thread actually giving me the benefit of the doubt rest being cucks instantly thinking i botted lol
wow,removed,leveling wasnt even that hard in wod you are just pathetic
wow,removed,delete this clown posting
wow,removed,and those of people should really seek help for their mental health
wow,removed,you are a disgusting person and i hope you never get your account back
wow,removed,yes i tested it actually about weeks ago my friend got on her filthy alliance alt because when we were out doing a world pvp quest another horde was yelling it over and over at them we were like wtf so she said lemme log on my alli and you yell that and well see sure enough she screenshotted it and sent it to me and it definitely translated
wow,removed,this shit blows my mind more than the presidential election
wow,removed,check top logs before you talk all high level are still using outlaw sheep
wow,removed,got anything for a trump refugee
wow,removed,no they literally dont give a fucking shit because current retail wow is so easy that you can kill players in arenas as a sub rogue blindfolded do you honestly think it matters to these people about actual dungeonraid tactics it doesnt they just want their gear and get the fuck out of there afterwards preferably without having to say a word or work as a team because then thatd ruin the illusion of being in a single player game where theyre the hero of the world since cataclysm when the game became much easier casuals were attracted like flies to a steaming festering turd to this game slowly turning it into this shit show that we have today where hunters just go fucking nuts and spam barrage like theres no tomorrow my advice unsubscribe and uninstall this game and just wait for nostalrius thatll come out on elysium soon there wont be casuals there thatll fuck around in your dungeons
wow,removed,the game all went downhill when cataclysm came out bud id recommend a wotlk private server like wow circle or dalaran wow you will not enjoy current gameplay its been tailored for casuals to enjoy breezing through content and getting rewarded just stay away from wow im not trolling im not being sarcastic ive already unsubscribed and uninstalled this the fourth expansion that ive had to unsubscribe after months of playing since cataclysm just stay away from retail dude
wow,removed,oh you like playing legion why would you want to pay for a game like that when you can just play farmville on facebook it probably has less lag than wow does and its free and its developers doesnt constantly strive to see how far they can fuck around with you and still have you pay them for content lmao
wow,removed,uadifferentpath hopefully the different path you walk is off a cliff
wow,removed,oh my that age pretty much from the survey are oldfags
wow,removed,unholy could use some love and frost could use some scaling help so that its not shit everytime a new tier comes out and has to get buffed seriously confused as to why they are against scaling would be so much easier to change something then keep going through the obliterate buffnerfbuff cycle
wow,removed,lol take you all week to come up with that
wow,removed,are people this ignorant to think that a bot took them jesus i hate when these are posted and some retard goes herp derp must be a bot cuz i was too slow
wow,removed,dont mean to sound like a beggar but looking for some game time too if anyone has any my friend is about to ship off and cant afford it but id love to be able to play with him please pm if you have
wow,removed,i would like a promo code too plss

wow,removed,varian gets kill off jaina new leader of the alliance so we can see catfighting and give a reason for sylvanasxjaina
wow,removed,please please everyone sign this petition to show the wow devs that we do not want them to disable actioncam httpwwwipetitionscompetitiondontdisableactioncam
wow,removed,lelele reddit forced meme xd
wow,removed,i just started playing again after a year hiatus and its really none of your business how i was when i used to play and its irrelevant to this thread however i can confidently say that i am not a raging douchebag like you also im pretty confident that you are below the age of given your responses and refusal to let this go do you realize that when you inevitably have to give up this game no one is going to care about how good you were at a game i used to be good a bunch of games no one cares
wow,removed,sorry dude as the top voted comment shows wow is about playing what people expect you to be able to contribute to their fun not about doing what is most fun for you if you want to play a solo game play what you want if you want to play with others you need to toe the line

wow,removed,i also wanted to give back so heres a for some shadow priest pvp
wow,removed,and youre not funny fam grow the fuck up
wow,removed,you were saying bitch
wow,removed,
wow,removed,youre a stupid person who is playing stupid games prepare to receive stupid prizes
wow,removed,he said semi hardcore tard
wow,removed,its a common expression for people in my age group mid twenties and i doubt you have never heard someone use the term in the same way they envisioned a different game similarly to how hitler envisioned a different world without the jews they up and remove something from the game jews because they dont like it on a personal level there was literally people saying remove masterloot jews from the game
wow,removed,lol do you think i care about comparing something to hitler hell no i am not going out of my way to be politically correct online i wouldnt say something like that at my job but once i am with very good friends or people whos opinions do not affect my life i dont have anything to walk away from because it will not affect me
wow,removed,ok bold out text to make a point sure but i was talking mainly about flying until someone in the thread was asking why wotlk is so much better than legion assuming i meant it was only flight making the difference there are threads upon threads of people who dislike the changes to flying and you can see wod threads or people quitting by the bunch because blizzard gave them false hope this is a red herring our conversation is about master loot i wont let you change the topic because you are losing the argument your sensitivity is the only reason you would be that taken back by someone using such a comparison it isnt sensitivity its that you used a stupid comparison in which you compared a trivial change in a trivial game to a regime which engulfed the world in war and cost people lives you say stupid things expect to be treated like a stupid person
wow,removed,i was having issues too and then i wifi hotspotted to my cell phones internet tmobile and now its working perfectly instantly got in the client without issue
wow,removed,some classes can buy theirs like i said the idea is great the implementation is not if you cant wrap your feeble little brain around something that isnt absolutely one or the other this is not the conversation for you
wow,removed,downvoted u retarded little shit
wow,removed,
wow,removed,how about poseidon kappa
wow,removed,upvote this guy reddit frontpage wooo yayyyyyy people are not dicks so rare
wow,removed,nice bro i got some
wow,removed,just saw on the app and came to post this is fucking retarded blizz can shove that claw up its collective butthole
wow,removed,sounds like a retard
wow,removed,you didnt explain clearly what happened hence my questions i know all about sh and i know the mobs you are talking about you are upset you wiped in a dungeon oh my goodness what a terrible experience it must have been for you i hope you are okay you may want to contact a counselor for the severe ptsd you are suffering from
wow,removed,i know all about sh those mobs arent hard if pulled right sounds like the tank bit off more than they could chew and mcdouchenuts is mad they wiped
wow,removed,i took as someone whining like a baby about some bullshit
wow,removed,i thought mop dailies got old fast same shit everyday until your rep got higher then you would get more of the same shit to do everyday then locking one rep behind another was seriously fucked up it put you in a position where it was damn near mandatory to grind that rep just to gain access to another rep to start grinding
wow,removed,ya i know im on this fucker all throughout the workday and it astounds me the trivial things people make threads about i force myself not to respond sometimes because i dont want to get banned
wow,removed,i highly doubt it since can run them if theres a chance thats cool but i wouldnt hold my breath
wow,removed,hes right safter arluin dies his body magically turns into this flower pot
wow,removed,am i the only one that thinks constant use of smiley faces is queer you guys arent actually sitting at your computers with shit eating grins all the time are you basic communication gives you so much happy emotion it spills into all of your banter you can be nice pleasant and professional without constant use of emotes if you use them constantly they start to lose weight and meaning i find it overly patronizing and since people do it constantly it carries zero meaning anymore
wow,removed,of course blizz will try to program the game to make it enjoyable for people if they didnt people wouldnt give them money this expansion has been out weeks and we have about more weeks to go im positive the mount will become available in that time whining about not getting the quest for the mount this early just shows the level of entitlement some players have and i find it pathetic
wow,removed,i have learnt through my actions that the wow subreddit loves being cucked by wow gms thank you for enlightening me
wow,removed,ya youre complaining about a nonissue and coming off as selfish and entitled if the mount quest hadnt popped and there was a month left until the next expansion i could see some validity to your complaint but this early into the expansion rng is rng deal with it
wow,removed,overall i think suramar is great but i agree locking the story behind certain rep thresholds is pretty poopy and i completely agree about withered army training i wouldnt mind it so much if they werent dumb as hell and continuously aggrod shit im not trying to attack sadly i play protection paladin and the cache at the end has my hidden appearance so i foresee running that many many many times
wow,removed,i dont have a bad attitude im just fine i was at work killing time
wow,removed,yes i find anyone complaining about wiping in a dungeon time a douche
wow,removed,its obvious you are traumatized by wiping in a dungeon i just want you to get the help and support you need
wow,removed,youre complaining about a game mechanic that has been in the game since its inception and is always going to be in the game and damn near every other loot based game ever made its like complaining that its hot on a summer day well duh its hotits the fucking summer its supposed to be hot
wow,removed,do you have a hard time comprehending english or are you just fucking stupid
wow,removed,this sub is all lfr it seems you guys are not casual most of you are just fucking bad the was you use the term casual is so fucking downgrading
wow,removed,world of warcraft trump
wow,removed,waaaaaaaaah mommy i didnt get a legendary waazaaaaah imma throw a fit on reddit mommy because i deserve a legendary waaaaaaaaah

wow,removed,just when thought things are going well this happens damn you blizzard
wow,removed,ugh comment retard
wow,removed,old hag syndrome goes wow
wow,removed,fap that
wow,removed,
wow,removed,nothing racist there biologically speaking the average male of african descent has a larger member than males of european descent translation black guys got bigger dicks than white guys if you are hoping the script kiddies become someones prison bitch that someone might as well have the potential to be more damaging to the script kiddies posterior
wow,removed,theres a bug where your character can only have moh at a time getting g any more from any source will cause them to disappear
wow,removed,i love using that toy plus the world shrinker d
wow,removed,okay you simply arent getting it so move along pleb lord
wow,removed,good job buddy just wish you could add the old colors
wow,removed,no your idea is shit and you should feel like shit for suggesting it
wow,removed,lame hopeless posts like this is whats killing wow players like you in general
wow,removed,only reason id take my dick out for harambe is so i could piss on his stupid hairy corpse fuckgorillas gorillalivesdontmatter getatmebro
wow,removed,i smell perverts
wow,removed,reminds me of what happened when test alliances mumble hosting service dropped them suddenly a couple thousand autists got their twitter so hard they rebranded
wow,removed,are you too retarded to say nerfed instead of being a little child
wow,removed,holy fuck these are some of the shittiest ideas ive seen
wow,removed,stfu retard
wow,removed,you get to choose where the loot goes
wow,removed,a player that can do on a warlock could do on most other classes
wow,removed,i said elsewhere that people shouldnt automatically believe some bullshit numbers that are released in a shit magazine and not to shareholders yet you retards all bit on this million garbage hook line and sinker anyway
wow,removed,you can use a coin to reroll any boss as many times as you want
wow,removed,but ive seen a lot of people also say that the item you get is bound to the highest completed within the time limit that is correct
wow,removed,all my best mythic runs up to and including have been pugs everyone i know are bad or slackers pugs are the only solution apart from server transfer only had bad pug experience thus far and i did a lot of mythic
wow,removed,looks a little bit like a tard x
wow,removed,i too saw that thread here a few days ago
wow,removed,congratulations youve caught me im a liar good job you jackass
wow,removed,im sorry officer im new to driving i didnt mean to run over all those kids back there i didnt know
wow,removed,not knowing the toseula is his fault not blizzards
wow,removed,niglivesmatter
wow,removed,and you think losing half your subs somehow results in more store purchases what world do you live in lower user count means lower revenue
wow,removed,it matters not whether you decide to read it you agreed to it in order to play you are bound by the rules you break them you lose your right to play sorry not sorry
wow,removed,whether you know its a rule or not is your responsibility you agreed to the tos when you played the game it is not blizzards responsibility to make sure you read it dont cheat and you wont get banned now im ignoring you because you are an idiot
wow,removed,voljin
wow,removed,and op is advocating that his friend shouldnt be punished for not knowing the rules he broke do you know how to read
wow,removed,i forget does it say free lets check yep it does at this point in time your ignorance has hit a level of grasping for straws just fucking leave all you ignorant fucks need to stop being so god damn butthurt and come to terms with it
wow,removed,my goto list elvui for general ui niceness dbmgtfo for boss mechanicstimers details for damagehealing meters postal for opening mail way easier
wow,removed,rwownoob
wow,removed,proving even more the great uselessness of locks lol
wow,removed,except dks are inherently more durable and have tons of cc breakscc prevention comparing the two is as retarded as you are
wow,removed,now you understand how white privilege works irl
wow,removed,yes because companies dont spin anything there is multiplayer in no mans sky too they also never called it a trial anywhere
wow,removed,mechanics do not change they just get a to hpdamage you also get certain affixes each week that make the dungeons a little harder
wow,removed,rip in pieces
wow,removed,not sure you can really jump to that conclusion based off of evidence
wow,removed,unless hes using a router provided by the isp
wow,removed,each boss is its own lockout you can kill every boss timesweek but you will only get loot if you have not yet killed it
wow,removed,damage that is surpassed by one spec from every class healthstones that can be replaced by potions portals that pretty much do nothing and sometimes kill half your raid
wow,removed,i think i did it everything was in sweedish except the questions so i dont know
wow,removed,is it plausible for someone to keep earning enough gold without the expansion to pay for sub tokens
wow,removed,kindly point to the part of my post where i advocated retarded anal jokes in trade chat do you say we shouldnt have police stop rapists they should be stopping murderers or do you think the police should maybe stop both
wow,removed,id absolutely hate this so many times in a dungeon i just swap to tank real quick and i just know theyd reuse the bg mechanic that locks you to a spec
wow,removed,youre a fucking retard
wow,removed,i highly doubt youre getting life relics you might be assuming the trinkets which look like relics are life relics but they are not aside from that you get wq for any spec not just your current
wow,removed,master loot has one purpose to decide where the loot goes if you dont value this feature theres no reason to use ml
wow,removed,what one gave another gave resources jim is giving ap for just showing up holy fuck you whiney shits
wow,removed,yeah who needs the biggest source of ap so far in the game right stupid shits
wow,removed,withered jim drops bis trinkets for a ton of specs better than anything in en barring high titanforged shit but if you argue about titanforged shit then the withered jim trinket could be titanforged too bis from world bosses that are so heavily rotated is fucked the fact that you think you are entitled to whatever loot you want is whats fucked dipshit azeroth will continue to turn whether or not you get your greedy fucking hands on some random piece of loot
wow,removed,i dont see how you cant see why its shitty to have your literally best in slot trinke drop from something that only shows up once every weeks even if it was weekly and you kill it times it would still be rare but in those weeks you get to kill him just once you act like this is the only fucking trinket available in the fucking game you dont fucking remotely need this trinket if you dont get it use one of the other fucking trinkets that are available guess what mythic was cleared by a fuck ton of guilds and they didnt have your fucking trinket get over it kid
wow,removed,the fact that you think its fucked that something you want is hard to get is equivalent to saying you deserve it dumbass you think its fucked solely because its rare and only because you want it if you didnt want it you wouldnt give a shit kid mythic has been cleared by numerous guilds none of which had your fucking trinket youll live so will everyone else that doesnt happen to get something thats rare that they want youll be fine the system isnt fucked because you cant have every god damn thing you want you fucking child
wow,removed,you know that you get tuned for the arenabg no pvp gear is still there if you want to have it for the good look or whatever artifact pvp appearance is amazing on some classes also so no lvl full m will do more damage than you on an arenabg yet looks like people come to this game expecting to fullfill all their expectactions thats kind of utopic dont you think
wow,removed,my dream patch is an immersion patch kinda style minipatch with little content more system changes change the emote system to be similar to you can for instance do the shrug emote without performing it in chat allowing you to do extra posing with your character without filling chat with irrelevent text in rp fix a lot of unusable chairs especially in class halls paladin hall has no usable chairs most importantly work a lore journal into the adventurers journal a collection of lore bsed on your completion percentage in every zone complete with hyperlinks say for instance youre working on questing in tanaris as you get quests that introduce you to new characters like marin noggenfogger or kelsey steelspark you can view brief bios on them as you quest further through the zone you can see the actual storyline of the zone advancing in your lore journal every few quests adds a journal entry or so to the overall story until you loremaster that zone and have the full journal of the zone it could also save copies of all sorts of readable books and items maybe there could be achievements and rewards for completing certain stories over the course of several questing experiences you finish the full story for say lilian voss and you get a little achievement for that and maybe even some extra lore on her that helps bridge the gaps this system would easily fit in place with archaeology too of course the worst thing i could see about that system is that it would take a lot of written content but its not really that blizzard has any lack of capable writers in its entire community let alone the rp community that would be interested in a resource like this that is to suggest crowd source it offer ingame crediting to any player who writes an accepted lore biography for another character with an immersionappropriate name being used of course no biographies of sylvanas being attributed ingame to xxarthasdkxx please dragon slayers and pvp heroes get content all the time i dont think one measley rp and story focused patch would attract too much derision last night as we were killing her in mythic i offhandedly brought up just how grim and sad elerethe renferals story was and how fitting it was that her nightmare was mulgore to a friend they had no idea this was a character with a story or a background or even one they interacted with a million times in the past recontextualizing it made her appreciate the fight and the aesthetics and locale a lot lot more id like to see that more often
wow,removed,i did get super lucky and get pieces but if it werent for that it would have been a total waste of time its base regardless you were trying to say that if you didnt get the loot it would have been a waste of time the single largest source of ap so far in the game isnt a fucking waste of time herp derp especially when you consider it requires click and a few minutes of afking at most go fuck yourself you stupid fuck
wow,removed,yeah if youre expecting the base ilvl of wq rewards to be higher than raid loot youre going to be disappointed
wow,removed,its
wow,removed,heroics dont give loot anymore what do you mean heroics always give you loot
wow,removed,do you have a racial bonus or max rep that lowers price because its definitely
wow,removed,or they lowered the cost which is possible i guess i paid for it in mop
wow,removed,i love mine
wow,removed,vamos
wow,removed,id like to see her purple down unda
wow,removed,and here are your two flasks my good man
wow,removed,thats something you do with randos in trade who dont want to tip not guildmates
wow,removed,
wow,removed,httpwwwphilosophyexperimentscomwason yes your level of education is well noted glad youre willing to share it with everyone oh and your video game neckbeard stuff too pat introspect
wow,removed,oh man i did this all the time in tbc with primal mights because people thought that because they supplied the mats for they were entitled to procs for free
wow,removed,you are a bad guildie
wow,removed,if they dont get procs theres no reason to ask you to make them flasks buying mats is more expensive than the flasks nowadays the procs are a part to pricing the flasks
wow,removed,downvote isnt a disagree button anyways sure if you believe that no one should ever ask you to make them pots then they have reason to
wow,removed,how are you screwing anyone but yourself makes no sense its not dishonest player wanted two flasks why should they get the bonus of your profession
wow,removed,yeah thats what we do oh wait we actually bring our own shit
wow,removed,op is a retard
wow,removed,quick downvote him into oblivion where he belongs
wow,removed,spoiler tags were invented for a reason twat
wow,removed,literally unplayable nice maymay xdxdxdxd
wow,removed,makes vague reference to some obscure shit its a joke bro time to take yo autism pills
wow,removed,your point
wow,removed,dae hate le garrison
wow,removed,youre literally playing trash spec in arena what do you expect to answer all your questions re roll hpallyrdruidrsham and problems solved
wow,removed,hai frands i jus tyed mah sholaces fur da furst tyme in mah lyre rite i hit ay ay

wow,removed,asswipe
wow,removed,alodi is a cuck for artifacts
wow,removed,everyone just used the same speak for yourself idiot
wow,removed,most of the talents were stupid bullshit people like you are bad at games like youre bad at logic i hope youre happy with the shit talent system your ignorance has created
wow,removed,fuck right off
wow,removed,you dont need to interact with anyone on a social level in order to run just apply for groups ignore them do a quick run for the instance and leave after you finished the dungeon that is what i always do because in groups there is just as much toxicity as there is in heroic dungeons or lfr people like you is what makes this game worse as long as its not something i can queue for ill still complain about it what a fucked up attitude you have there
wow,removed,why does the us have ancient aztec ruins shouldnt they be in mexico
wow,removed,some of the most powerful humans of all time lived in mexico and the us is a cult of uncivilized trolls very true
wow,removed,yea i agree that people who wants legacy and those talents are really pathetic not that there is much wrong with it but its digusting how they think they deserve old servers from company we love kids these days man
wow,removed,the preliminaries suggest the outcome is quite grim
wow,removed,by the background im going to assume youre in darkbruul that means to have hit you for million he had berserking buff or you did cry more
wow,removed,why even bother talking about nongood legendaries
wow,removed,christ youre an idiot enjoy life
wow,removed,what did you read the guide apparently not you dull witted necromonger you can finish it in about an hour and change since lovely human beings have already posted the guide on all the secrets regarding kosumoth

wow,removed,frost is still just ok though not good just not gutter tier anymore
wow,removed,bingo but people who play blizzards favorite classes dont care seems like half the fucking population is druid and mage these days
wow,removed,i can hold off my suicide for another week i guess suffer well brothers
wow,removed,im in a similar position i wonder if its bugged for some people
wow,removed,hes not dead dead guldan brings back his corrupted wolf forms in his second phase

wow,removed,no mt was fun
wow,removed,you poor poor man i hope bing shop works long enough for you to buy a rope cry
wow,removed,btw wts primordial saronite cheap
wow,removed,im going to post it as many times as i want to post it you cant do a single thing to stop me and if by nobody cares you mean the upvoted thread on the forums a few months ago about this issue is nobody then you are right stay irrelevant
wow,removed,i think you commented the same thing last time too there isnt a single person ive ever met who enjoys them procing at different times not even so yeah nice attention seeking
wow,removed,frost dk for button mashing glory
wow,removed,frost dk for button mashing glory
wow,removed,frost dk for button mashing glory
wow,removed,the commissioner is happy with the appearance of his character
wow,removed,so it is a female i meant no disrespect at all just didnt know what racegender the paladin is since it honestly doesnt look like something from wow
wow,removed,you directly imply that older raids no i directly imply what i stated classes and the damage we deal are balanced for level in legion so what we have powerwise in prepatch is not what they cared about when balancing classes youre the confused one bud
wow,removed,okay i have had enough are you actually fucking high right now youre the one who made it about the raid i was exclusively talking about classes a lot of classes lost a good chunk of damage which was being complained about because he couldnt kill the boss through the healing because he doesnt have his tranq shot and ignoring this he could actually just perform the mechanics the way theyre intended as someone states above so again you are the one who made it about the raids themselves i was talking about the class balance
wow,removed,i will respond one last time who the fuck talks about old raids when saying blizzard balances for level its obvious as fuck that im talking about classes because at this point its a canned response for most of us when someone bitches about removed skills lowered dps etc and how they impact old raids those raids are over and done with two expansions ago now there is a little thing called context which you completely ignored you opted to try and call me out for bullshit that wasnt even being said then you fucking dare to say that i was talking about something i wasnt and have clarified for multiple posts now seriously dude get sober you need it
wow,removed,did you really not read what the other person even talked about they complained about their inability to use tranq shot and couldnt outdamage the healing of the boss you know class changes not raid changes class changes you seem very angry and bitter yes when i get accused of saying something i didnt youre right i will get angry at you especially when i tried to clarify it for you multiple times and you continued to ignore it im going to report and block you oh no im so unhappy about this especially the blocking part what ever will i do when someone cant even take context into account
wow,removed,hours of work at dollars per hour
wow,removed,hi im the artist dan the paladins player was sitting with me in twitch chat the entire time i painted this every change and major decision was made by him if he didnt like it i painted over it he said he was happy with ryyu and thats pretty much what matters thanks for your opinion
wow,removed,thanks for clarifying one month has passed since you did the last painting so i tought that you didnt wanted to finish them painting characters obviously isnt an easy task ps sorry for my crappy english
wow,removed,in before make gender change free because i dont identify as a gender irl
wow,removed,why dont you make some kind of statement that its blizzard shamingputting a penalty on being a minority theyll change it then everyone caves when it comes to sjws because theyre afraid of what happens if they tell them to fuck off and die like the rats they are
wow,removed,i think would be the max that should be charged for this quality of work rather than going off time investment overall the work is just kind of lacking in certain areas ignoredavoided areas feet hands backgroundsetting etc rather generic yet clashing art styles overall low detail in a lot of areas like you mentioned i think could be a semiacceptable price but imo there are a lot of equally or more talented artists around tumblr working for much cheaper this is two fully detailed characters with a background thrown on ps the perspectiveforeshortening is definitely off in certain areas which is an objective mistake
wow,removed,the cringe
wow,removed,im waiting for a sjw group to bitch about having to pay for genderchanges so i can get those for free too
wow,removed,the paladin design is based in part on a mix of the ishvalan race from fma and brienne of tarth in an odd way i asked for the style and the differences because if it kept to just what is available in game wow there is an incredible limit to what you can do as wows customization is awful the dark skinred eyes this is also actually based on how my character looks i wanted that design because it looks like how i imagined the paladin to look and on the style rune is more than capable of doing the traditional wow cartoony style but i wanted something which a touch more of the semitraditional fantasy look for it also the night elf looks like that because its pretty much impossible to draw one without it looking like its from wow because it has such a recognisable to wow design
wow,removed,go fuck yourself how about that
wow,removed,ah the old type dnd accountpassword into chat to get phat loots that was back when games actually let you type your password into chat ha
wow,removed,its a joke quit taking things up the ass dude lmao
wow,removed,remindme days dh stealth breaker macro
wow,removed,i see you havent taken anyones advice to calm down or relax i enjoy seeing you have a mental breakdown though so please keep going
wow,removed,who cares what some eurocuck thinks play what u wanna play
wow,removed,blood elves are for gays
wow,removed,filthy casuals like yourself downvoting me lul
wow,removed,yeah it shouldnt be possible to have max ak for another few days there was a thread maybe by the same person posted last week bragging about being one of the only people to get ak in its unlikely blizzard will do anything about it if it were a gm error but im hoping they continue their recent pattern of punishing exploiters
wow,removed,i dinged on the second night and i have about days left until i dont think its possible to have it legit
wow,removed,i have days left and hit midway through the second day of legion
wow,removed,our first hit cap about hours after launch and his isnt up u til like pm est monday so thats fucked if you took an extra hours and then missed another and finish before him
wow,removed,i dinged the first day of legion started my research immediately still days away
wow,removed,i have about days left im not sure on specifics but i get it before reset was planning on grinding time walking with max ak so i can get maximum ap while getting badges my game time is dead or id know the exact time holidays no point renewing for a few days i hit on the first day but at my time so went to sleep without starting ak so im hours behind where i could be but even without that delay its still nowhere near completion
wow,removed,your credibility is pretty shoddy so i think we all would really appreciate a screenshot eg days ago this guy commented in terrorist woman lynched by mob after suicide vest fails to explode over at justiceserved feioo this was believed to be the work of boko haram not sure there was any justice served here coonwithcrackers absolutely justice we have free will if you have the freedom to go to a market and blow it up you have the freedom to go to a market take the bomb off and leave yea im sure none of them have ever thought of that are you retarded coonwithcrackers are you that weak willed you seem like fine reasonable and trustworthy fellow based on that lovely exchanged nice name by the way
wow,removed,its not possible to get on eu without somekind of bug before even if it took you to do you would still be off
wow,removed,i was max level within hours of launch ran out of game time for about weeks and am currently hours from max ak at least twice ive had both work orders done without another one queued up i assumed people who were more diligent about it were already
wow,removed,i threw the data into a time calculator this is what i got using my local time cst in the us from your screenie im guessing youre in south australian maybe oceanic servers are the reason you got a surprise catchup
wow,removed,oooh so is max i got weirded out and made a ticket after not being able to que one more work order
wow,removed,and talk about this idea in wow battlenet forum i cant talk to forum because my limit time have expired on wow and i cant talk to forum
wow,removed,and yet people who do get in bitch and moan about the game some of they are not even subbed into the game at the moment some accounts are banned just stupid people who defend this are trolls and idiots
wow,removed,who gives a shit
wow,removed,man ur quick gotta be up and spry to lie ur way to queen cucks campaign
wow,removed,implying i dont swap usernames monthly implying that trump wont win implying he wont be a quest giver in legion release telling you to push out the invading demons and build a wall around the portals with their own power
wow,removed,if you can put up with his dutch or whatever eurotrash country he comes from accent
wow,removed,well the game changes alot each expansions some stuff gets better and some gets worse but the game will never be as exciting as it used to be not because the current content is bad or anything but the feeling of exploring something new for the first time taking the deeprun tram finding azuregos in azshara or a devilsaur in ungoro mounting up for the first time patches like dragonsoul siegeoforgrimmar and hellfirecitadel are extremely long and can get boring pretty fast unless you got a pretty social guild or a group of friends you can go raidingpvping with as someone who has neither of those things i only play once in a while to prepare myself for legion and sometimes i run through old raids for rare mounts pets
wow,removed,play on private servers
wow,removed,blizzard support is the best however i dont want to sound like a dick but this sounds really fake you really tried to push how sad your life was and it seems like really blatant emotional fishing what condition do you have that you need iv for
wow,removed,so sorry to hear about your mothers parkinsons disease
wow,not_removed,its a glitch happened to my friend too
wow,not_removed,yea just fixed it ty for reply
wow,not_removed,no prob
wow,not_removed,psa abilities like cloak of shadow anitmagic shield bubble etc will all stop you from being affected by the spell repentance without taking any stacks
wow,not_removed,i almost never blame the healer unless they consistently do subpar healing everyone can fuck up including yourself
wow,not_removed,top healers raiding mythic en are barely pulling an average of hps while i agree with what youre saying in raids you will always have a lower hps than what you are theoretically capable of because you cant just dump mana into throughput in a minute fight if the fight is like minutes long probably around what maiden takes honestly i dont remember then you have way more mana to work with meaning you can do way more healing i mean i did around hps on our groups nightbane kill took about minutes and still had mana left over comparing to raids is just a bad way to do it
wow,not_removed,is this jozieshadowsong lol because theyve been complaining in trade a lot about the same type of thing the past couple of days
wow,not_removed,wat healers dont vent
wow,not_removed,appreciate your healers everyone theyre unpaid babysitters
wow,not_removed,its not the healers fault that you dont understand the boss mechanics or how to avoid them youre completely right but on the other end of the spectrum coming from someone that played a healer for years and now mains a mage please healers if you get out of combat eat some mage food it blows my mind how many healers i have to tell to spam mage food as soon as they drop combat in m im not just slamming down mage tables every feet because its amusing the tank is specifically dropping combat after every other trash pack for your benefit we can all see your mana and know what cooldowns are available
wow,not_removed,yeah that was hard we wiped if more than one person took stacks by accident moroes however now hes a healing check the constant ticking damage from the garrotes was causing me to need to manage manawiped once due to going oom and chug out hps on top of that did have mana left over on the kill as i managed it better that time plus tank just tanked through a couple of the coat checks to save the mana on the dispelholy paladin
wow,not_removed,i did maiden yesterday and a huntard didnt step on the pool kept asking me to dispel the repentanceand since it cant be dispel he blamed me and immediate rage quit the group
wow,not_removed,did you explain it to them
wow,not_removed,it comes down to people reading the adventure log ill admit when i first met maiden my group college buddies and i thought it was the old fightstand in the pool to take damage and break the stun crafty blizzard cleverly changed the mechanic to punish is for relying on our old knowledge of course we wiped the first time and learned from our mistakes after we read over the adventure log dont worry about the idiots that are blaming you if they take more than a single stack multiple times or heaven forbid drop the damn sacred ground in the middle of the room then they deserve to have their accounts deleted tldr dont trust your memories always check the boss info log
wow,not_removed,i was intending on writing a similar post after dealing with people at maiden of virtue karazhan is a step above regular mythics it requires you to intimately deal with the mechanics of the fight rather than just have a good healer be able to heal the damage off i found mythics to be a breeze there was a lot of healing to be done but i shrugged it off as they went pretty smoothly i didnt realize until later than for probably half of these id been carrying the team theres a few problems with my past way of attempting to do karazhan and how i intend to do it in the future im going to be making my own groups from now on this protects me from having to deal with flamers and those who dont understand how things work in karazhan make a macro explaining the fight and how it works explain clearly what the expectations for the runfight at hand dps isnt enough ignoring mechanics doesnt work etc make it clear about expectations for the group when forming you can also control the group so that you can do fights like maiden of virtue before moroes incredibly similar fights in terms of healing and damage requirements except heals can generally carry through moroes but not maiden a group that does maiden should have no problem doing moroes except you can clearly explain to the dps that they die because they picked up stacks or they didnt pop the bubble or whatever at moroes people can just be like you cant heal this fight not enough ilvl and try to bandwagon the healer into thinking its their fault its tiring when bad people who have been carried for their entire time in mythic and dungeons set these ridiculously high ilvl thresholds for content like kara they expect these high ilvls to carry them and then fights like maiden of virtue wreck them i hope maiden helps realize that you cant just blame the healer for your low dps and inability to do mechanics of a fight we all want to see content its not fair that healers need to overcompensate for poor dps and although dps threshold mechanics like garotte matter id like to see more hard enrages that just tell dps you need to perform better its not the healers fault rant
wow,not_removed,i think i lucked out on my karazhan run we wiped on maiden twice once not knowing exactly the mechanics the time i had my camera turned around so i heroic leaped to the wrong spot to drop my holy pee puddle all in all we wiped over hours due to many mistakes but we all kinda shrugged it off and laughed especially at the mage and shadow priest who would manage to yank every trash pack we missed while running back i cannot stand elitist groups who try and blame anyone after being a raid leader for years started way back with the original karazhan being critical of someone without understanding why something happened just isnt in the playbook see a mistake discuss it thats how you progress ive actually stopped playing my healer except to help guildiesfriends who need a fast queue into a mythic because healer shaming is at an all time high in mythics and mythic
wow,not_removed,kara has been a nightmare as a healer so far so many mechanics that cause massive dmgoneshots and yet people refuse to admit that maybe its just a little bit their fault for standing in shittriggering flame wreath
wow,not_removed,as a afli lock i ignore most moderate damage mechanics if i am casting something or somethings with a cast time as i can easily heal back with the caveat if its a m or a group thats kinda iffy i play more carefully and dont take any excess damage that i can avoid
wow,not_removed,i have stopped using healer and have started calling myself retard mitigation
wow,not_removed,you are correct but i felt like doing the final boss of court last night at with volcanic was expecting million hps from me as a normal part of the encounter if you get a keystone over for court delete it it is not worth it i feel like we overgear even and that boss is a fuckfest of brutal
wow,not_removed,tank here im watching the debuffs too so i know whose to blame our resto shaman last night was doing hps on maiden due to people screwing that up
wow,not_removed,simply put i agree its a lot of damage and to cover the dmg to group it does require a cooldown not everyone has a ton of cooldowns paladin myself so i can rotate cooldowns ive had my fair share of bad players for kara but i love the difficulty even if im shitting bricks during that fight but im glad the boss thats hell on healers also drops the best cloak ever for them heh so your pain is rewarded
wow,not_removed,lol
wow,not_removed,yeah i started healing on my paladin and its become much clearer to me that every role has equal responsibility for succeeding
wow,not_removed,had to heal a mage warrior and lock that kept stacking dots on my first kara run thank cenarius for tranquility i get that people like to wait to make sure they get the dot and didnt miss it for some latency reason or whatever but seriously you just have to shift a fraction on that consecrated ground and then move off instantly afterwards i gaurantee you youll get the dot unless its lag you really shouldnt be getting more than stack
wow,not_removed,it took my group tries to down new maiden without reading anything we picked up on the stacking dot damage by the attempt and quickly understood we only had to tap the holy zones asshole group mates look for a scapegoat actual group mates look for a way to adaptunderstand
wow,not_removed,while youre right you also need to lay the smack down on people like that and not just vent here if they blame you because you cant keep them up for stacks laugh at them if they kick you make sure you never group with them again if theyre standing in shit on maiden and blaming you then you dont stand a chance against curator better to ditch the group early
wow,not_removed,this is why i dont pug
wow,not_removed,while i agree with your point as a mythic healer you can certainly heal more than i can regularly hit overall as a holy pally and ive seen my guilds resto shaman do around when the raid stacks for group healing for the type of burst damage youre talking about
wow,not_removed,psa people are idiots
wow,not_removed,your main point is solid but some points a the tank doesnt need the dot repentance breaks when you take damage and being punched by the boss does damage b a lot of classes can cheese this or just use personals c im an ilevel resto shaman and i could definitely heal people with stacks but it would be a bit rough and definitely not preferable
wow,not_removed,i dont even have a healer and i feel your pain an rogue runs ahead and aggros first hallway pair and then the three groups in front of the boss before anyone else even starts down the hallway dies in seconds lol garbage tank and heals i didnt heal him for the rest of the dungeon kept everyone else neatly topped off he died and ran back two more times neat
wow,not_removed,question bc i havent gotten to kara yet with my guild life has been superseding games lately are the fights the same or different than oldschool kara bear in mind i have done oldschool kara if they are different are these people also not learning the fights as well since there is no version of the man kara before this mythic only version
wow,not_removed,healers heals people pro healers heals stupid
wow,not_removed,mate regarding virtue of maiden there is no visual indication you have the dot on you and no real indication what is happening we wiped times before we figured out that you dont stand in the pool waiting for mass repentance to be cast and that was only by studying the combat logs and head scratching over why the damage was not
wow,not_removed,i completely agree i did kara yesterday as a holy priest and was in there for hours everyone ended up quitting at the last boss we got him down to once we would have people just stand there when the eye beam was on them and not dodge his disintegrate and when they died theyd be like heals i got tired of it and made a rogue lol
wow,not_removed,inversely nothing is as orgasmic as a true symbiotic relationship between healer and tank when youre at the front lines getting your face smashed into pulp and you have that miracle healer whispering words of comfort over your shoulder keeping your head attached there is no greater feeling of reward and that catharsis as all the enemies are broken before you and the healer tops off your green meter with a pleasant sigh you remember why you signed up to be the bulwark the tank isnt the leader oh sure they are at the front but their job is to put themselves between you and the angry mobs dying to tear into your giblets
wow,not_removed,these kinds of post are getting old im sorry you had a bad experience on the internet but shit happens you will meet idiots and assholes sometimes but such is life
wow,not_removed,dude i agree with you except for one thing as a druid resto with ilvl i can keep at least for second in mm and i did it in mos inside the boat but yeah its not the healers fault
wow,not_removed,honestly the mechanics arent too well explained for that fight i was standing in it for a while because i didnt realize you should only touch it then run the group i was in wiped times before we realized what to do
wow,not_removed,im sorry if this is seems rather stupid but i dont understand you have to step in a pool that applies a dot in order to break a cc what type of cc is that you have enough control over in order to move
wow,not_removed,if you know it isnt your fault then why would you have to vent tell them whats up or just leave the group man
wow,not_removed,at that point i just say in p im sorry but i cant heal stupid
wow,not_removed,top healers raiding mythic en are barely pulling an average of hps what average for most boss fights that really need healing are upwards like ursoc and that fight is minutes long not like maiden you can easily pull hps or more for that short amount of time
wow,not_removed,you didnt view the guide for healing in a mmo
wow,not_removed,maybe you should try communicating that to the group next time but i did and they ignored me maybe you should get better at communicating then
wow,not_removed,mythic dps with volcanic and sanguine i need to repair why do you need to repair in a mythic you let me die too much
wow,not_removed,i straight up refuse to do maiden if people wont do the mechanics that fight is hard enough if everyone does it rightit is impossible if people fuck it up
wow,not_removed,you had job keep everyone alive regardless of circumstances clearly you are at fault
wow,not_removed,it may not be your fault for their incompetence but it is your fault if you stay in the group past two or three wipes if they keep doing it
wow,not_removed,also warriors can use berserker rage
wow,not_removed,brm monks stagger breaks repentance also
wow,not_removed,rage of the sleeper also makes you immune with the proper artifact trait to the repentance ability meaning you dont need to grab a stack at all
wow,not_removed,i think shadowmend also works from priests it seems like it would be an easy way to cheese the fight
wow,not_removed,paladins with hand of sacrifice should break it as well i used to bos a healer while tanking maiden during early bc in order to survive repentance
wow,not_removed,also stoneform dwarven racial abillity
wow,not_removed,shadow priests can also shadowmend themselfs or others and the dot will remove repentance
wow,not_removed,does aspect of the turtle work for this as well
wow,not_removed,does empower wards work for a vengance dh
wow,not_removed,does human racial work
wow,not_removed,i did kara with a holy priest that died on every single boss fight youd think he was shadow but then he would have been more useful
wow,not_removed,do have to see why their numbers are low though had a paladin tank bitch at me earlier for outhealing me on mythic gorefiend when i had died early due to being rooted and his guild mates not clearing the root so i got sent in early and then ultimately died to shadow of death i was solo healing a group for the record if other people didnt kill me my numbers were just fine and was usually midpack on dps as well yeah times out of poor hps is probably the healers fault but my point is that numbers arent always everything
wow,not_removed,flash heal for days i can stick around hps during constant damage with that serenity when shit hits the fan apotheosis gives me serenity every flash heals so every seconds or so and those crits are very nice to have
wow,not_removed,yeah i thought about this point too with bloodlust the shaman trait healing during bloodlust ascendant healing and all healing totems dropped plus the group stacking for healing rain i would probably be able to pull off million hps for seconds of course this doesnt mean that one should have to do it during the first few tries my group thought we had to enter the debuff zone shortly before the repentance and then stay in there until we can get out due to the stun people repeatedly got debuffs once we figured out that you just need to get the debuff and then go out of the zone and take the repentance outside of it it became a really easy fight
wow,not_removed,true but fight length is not the only factor group size changes hps by alot as a resto shaman chain heal build might not do much good in dungeons but in a stacked raid fight my throughput can be huge also some cooldowns are especially good in raid scenarios healing tide totemtranquilityrevival leading to higher throughput with bigger groups i think raid and dungeon healing is simply different but i agree hps for that fight should be more than enough if people are doing the mechanics how they are supposed to be doing them
wow,not_removed,also your solo healing more chance for heals to be sniped
wow,not_removed,ayy lmao i thought our realms were dead i play on borean tundra im surprised there are still people who havent blocked jozie
wow,not_removed,every time i heal i turn into samir from office space
wow,not_removed,sowing discord i see
wow,not_removed,no we dont we mumble
wow,not_removed,healers are definitely appreciated maiden happens to be a huge dps and mechanics check as well as a healer awareness fight props to those who heal it well for sure
wow,not_removed,there are plenty of tanks that do not see my mana bar they chain pull which is great and all some tanks tunnel and they need to be reminded i need mana
wow,not_removed,it should be noted though that there is no reason to waste time on drinking between fights if the healer knows the dungeon and his limits in myth theres certain places where i know i have to drink before a huge pack or whatever but there are also a lot of places where i can comfortably start combat with mana without a single issue notibly on boss fights i end the fight with more mana than i started with so wasting time to drink before the boss fight would be just that a waste of time if your healer is good he knows when to drink and if your tank is good he know when your healer has to drink this only becomes a problem if the healer doesnt know their class too well and ends up underestimating the amount of mana needed for a fight so unless you are dying id suggest letting your healer manage his own mana although i always appreciate a mage who puts tables down
wow,not_removed,you need to spread the word to your other mages bro i have to request normally multiple times then end with conjured food please means mage please then they make me one but im on of those healers that goes thru a stack each mythic ticks of drink and poof kitty speed activate and catch up to the dead tank thats running ahead to get us those boxes
wow,not_removed,as someone who has also mained heals for years i dont want your stinking mage food especially in mythic level water regens your mana much faster than mage food no time to waste idc if yours is free no healer should be doing mythic without water
wow,not_removed,while we are at that you dps do that too nothing more annoying than to drink and then heal the dps because they did not eat themselves
wow,not_removed,i mostly experienced it the other way around not in m but in normal mythic people in groups with a healer simply forget that food exists we almost wiped and people get rezzed with half hp they wait for me to fucking heal them up they stood in every aoe possible and the whole group is below hey healer you better hurry up topping us all its really annoying
wow,not_removed,hots then shadowmeld drink mid trash packs is a life saver in mythic for me
wow,not_removed,a lot of it depends on the tank though in m like mos if the tank doesnt stop chain pulling for a second you may not get that break in combat while youre topside as a druid i can comfortably sit at about with innervate and potions i only need a mana break every once and a while
wow,not_removed,adding to what others have already said my mana pool should be good for several pulls without mage pool even assuming that you are pushing me to my limits natural regen is pretty high now with my crit of and regaining of mana per crit i sustain damn well if the group is half decent andor youre doing lower mythics i dont ever need to be slamming my mana pool either i can a mythic or lower without ever stopping to drink at all
wow,not_removed,this isnt the other end of the spetrum this is a different spectrum you are talking about a different thing
wow,not_removed,weird i thought that was a walk in the park since the group used the ghost traps and dpsd down targets accordingly
wow,not_removed,its not the garrote dmg that gets me its always that tick from mana drain that somehow finds its way to me but now that we learned you can successfully just pull all the adds at once it makes the fight much shorter and mana is much less of an issue
wow,not_removed,more of a dps check if you are going oom and people are dying to garrote then its probably a dps issue either something that should have been interrupted got through or dps just isnt up to par sustained fights are never healing checks its dps that make or break them true healing checks are pretty rare but its generally in the form of unavoidable pulsing aoe damage that people will die from quickly if they dont get x amount of healing tbh i dont think kara had any of these mostly hard dps checks that would oom a healer if dps wasnt doing their jobs
wow,not_removed,moroes is a joke just hit some cds and zerg down the adds at the start
wow,not_removed,you were definitely better off
wow,not_removed,not sure if you are aware how the mechanic works you need to have a dot on you to break the stun if you dont and you dont break the shield on the boss because your dps is stunned your entire group gets one shot cant ignore this mechanic
wow,not_removed,stands in fire proudly plays the worst spec available to the class yeah checks out
wow,not_removed,in this post that makes zero sense so ur casting repentance is haooening meh fuck it get stunned now u do zero dmg cuz you just killed the group due to not enough dmg to pop bubble
wow,not_removed,i need to macro this
wow,not_removed,at first volcanic was awful i mean it still kind of is but when you change your mind set from reactionary to just cast a spell move cast move it isnt as bad having said that fuck all these anti healer mythic conditions
wow,not_removed,cos can be very easy or very difficult depending on the perk you can trigger but the last boss is soooo hard with tyrannical on
wow,not_removed,fuck volcanic especially as a resto sham chain heal looks similar to the volcanic animation so if youre not looking at the ground when it start forming you get hit by it protip equip the chain heal glyph
wow,not_removed,hps was mentioned in regards to mythic en which is long fights of minutes
wow,not_removed,maiden has mechanic called repentance which is a stun that only breaks when you get damageor some personal cds so everybody need to get the stack of debuff otherwise you cant go out of stun
wow,not_removed,she has an abillity that targets a random player where after few seconds said player creates a pool on the ground hes standing that grows for couple of seconds that pool is nasty and each second in that pool gives you the debuff op wrote so the trick is when youre targeted by taht ability you run to the borders of the boss room and drop the pool there if the boss is being tanked in the middle and each player manages to drop the pool on the outskirts of the boss room you dont need to worry about it since the pool doesnt reach the players in the middle of the room now if someone fucks it up and drops the pool in the middle of the room for example theres probably not much space for the players to be without steping into the pools thus giving players many stacks of the debuff and wiping the entire group it requires great deal of coordination since the pools dont despawn during the fight also the boss casts an aoe ability that gives players a debuff that stuns them every second unless they receive damage now since the boss is casting the debuff she isnt attacking anyone nor the players can attack other players so the trick here is that when she is begining to cast the aoe you run to the nearest pool get only stack of the pools debuff then run out and wait for the stun debuff which will tick once stuning you then once the pools debuff ticks and deals damage to you you get unstuned and youre free to continuing dpsing the boss if this is already too much of a coordination in a pug group after the boss casts the aoe ability she automaticaly receives a shield taht blocks a lot of damage dont remember how much tbh but its a lot realy and while she has that shield she starts to cast an even worse aoe spell that will wipe the entire group if not interrupted but since this boss is realy something special you cant interrupt that cast aslong as the shield is active so the group needs to get into the pool to get the ticking debuff to free them of the stun debuff then when youre unstuck you need to nuke the boss down realy quickly to take out the shield fast enough for one of the players to interrupt her and if that wasnt bad enough she does this phase more quickly than the cooldown of the interrupt spells player has so you also need to designate an interrupt order by players like player a interrupts her the time player b interrupts on the time then its back to player a then b etc etc i also dont need to say that on the nuke phase you definetly need to have all players alive if at least one of the players is dead you pretty much wipe since theres not enough dps in the group to take the shield out before the cast is finished later in the expantion when people have better gear and overgear everything this will be easier and probably will be acomplished with as low as man yh unless your group knows what to do and dont fuck it up once youll be stuck on that boss for hours with wipe after wipe d took me attempts to finaly kill her
wow,not_removed,why are people having trouble with maiden we killed it fairly fast and i suck as a resto druid we had more trouble on the last boss an interrupt rotation in karazhan is crucial to have for quite a few bosses was that your problem
wow,not_removed,berserker rage works damn i never tried that but im certainly doing that in future
wow,not_removed,thats just plain handy
wow,not_removed,shadowmend too
wow,not_removed,nice
wow,not_removed,i was curious about this last night but i didnt try it because of that run back but thank you for the info
wow,not_removed,i need to get the trait
wow,not_removed,hmm thats very interesting thought might have to test that when i run on my disc priest
wow,not_removed,are you really really sure about this stoneform removes debuffs but doesnt make you immune to it so it doesnt help against repentance i also think you cant cleanse the debuff with it because it is not labelled as a magic debuff or else you could also simply dispell it
wow,not_removed,does it really wow wish i knew that last week my poor healer
wow,not_removed,only works if you are actually missing health though if you are full hp you wont get a dot
wow,not_removed,i believe so it works like bubble pop it before she gets the cast off
wow,not_removed,no idea what that does i dont play dh
wow,not_removed,i doubt it that works on stuns this is an incapacitate worth a try
wow,not_removed,it works on shade of medihvs ice block
wow,not_removed,it is actually a pretty regular tactic for holy to sac ourselves for free healing on those last few percent when we are running totally dry we have a whole talent level that is useless except for one talent that increases the length of the spirit form
wow,not_removed,should cover most normal mechanics but it should also be possible to peak much much higher if dps screw up and take more damage it shouldnt be too hard to peak at for druids for example have rejuv running cenarion ward active pop wg artefact flourish and tranquility that gives a ton of healing yes its limited to about seconds but it can counter pretty much all burst damage it might even be enough to heal through double stacks of that nasty debuff op described
wow,not_removed,i just dont bother blocking people lol in my down time i troll the trolls and they go silent at times and our realms are fairly quiet bigger servers have more pull because the server groupings need rebalancing badly for pvp and the large high horde and high alliance servers are big raiding pulls because you cant raid with opposing factions so why bother going to a balanced faction pop server for it
wow,not_removed,you know what i would do with a million dollars id take half of it down to my friend rajid in securities
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,those tanks need to be reminded that they should treat the healers mana bar like its their health bar empty means death if they cant do something that simple then any deaths are on them not you
wow,not_removed,this is honestly the way i like it the only time i need a tank to be considerate of my mana is when i say something along the lines of mb in chat i can manage most boss fights with very little mana and most tanks are able to survive by themselves for several seconds which gives me plenty of time to get my mana back up i try to drink every single time i drop combat and while it takes a lot of water it helps keep the pace high if i fall behind in distance i can always use my divine steed or nitro boost to catch up if i need to catch up really quick ive got a lay on hands dont mind my mana tanks i can look after myself
wow,not_removed,in those cases i usually drink while im out of combat and the tank can fend for themselves for a few seconds if notwell
wow,not_removed,its such a melee heavy game right now that i honestly think some tanks forget healers still have mana
wow,not_removed,if its a pug i always talk to the tank or healer im guardianresto druid before we start a m especially if youre going for chests everyone needs to be on the same page as a healer i tell them dont worry about my mana unless i say something im usually ahead of the group anyway hot everyone up and drink while they pull but i still have tanks stop right before a boss if im at mana and i have to spam r in chat i appreciate theyre paying attention but every second counts of course then therere healers like one i got last night i told him i was gonna chain pull unless he said something but id watch his mana too just in case all he said was pull everything chests with minutes to spare lol
wow,not_removed,yeah people defo need to eat more especially in m it wins valuable seconds if the healer doesnt have to top which is surprisingly hard on the mana if you dont want it to take forever
wow,not_removed,yeah thats what we did but the garrote dot effect that moroes puts out was kinda nasty especially since a couple of dps got stacks
wow,not_removed,the issue is the garrote not the adds its a combination healingdps check the higher your dps the fewer garrotes the less healing is required the last time i killed it we had garrotes out and luckily enough of them ended up on the tank prayer of mending is actually kind of op on that fight
wow,not_removed,yep did a speed run for nightbane bloodlustcd trampling the shit out of the mana drainer with chain stuns we still had a tick going on the healer sometimes its just brutal and interrupting it is almost impossible without a tick while stuns were just barely covering the time needed to blow her up
wow,not_removed,while not a joke persay this method does work for groups that could likely just as well heal through the extended duration of by adds but could also just kill them all at once did it in a pug this week and it surprised me as they pulled with no traps but shit just melted and it was much easier than a lesser pug doing it by
wow,not_removed,i was talking mechanics in general not just that one thats why i said moderate damage i ignore
wow,not_removed,incorrect affliction locks are simply better for mythicmythic dungeons sure destro can do it but why you put in too much effort and struggle to beat some of the stronger dps classes when affliction can keep up easily and is more useful throughout the whole dungeon
wow,not_removed,i know simdps is not the end all be all but is a fair arbiter of what someone can potentially do i sim out as the highest damaging warlock on my server the other are destruction and on my realm
wow,not_removed,it was dumb when he posted it and like times as dumb that you agreed with him since his class has self healing for days and yours does not
wow,not_removed,what he said is that the damage he takes from stacks is negligible since he just heals it upby using his dos kit so taking or stacks is not something hes worried about
wow,not_removed,posts like this make me feel bad for playing rdruid it feels like cheating for a lot of mechanics
wow,not_removed,volcanic itself is fine that particular fight it is not not only does that fight already demand so much from you as a healer it also involves tons of its own movement the kicker though is volcanic spawns from each mob in the fight the adds the boss spawns that mimic the blades ability which are unkillable count as mobs to spawn volcanic so not only does the boss have that soft enrage mechanic but volcanic gets worse along with it this has the trickle effect of lowering your dps due to movement requirements as well unless you have all melee dps i guess and that makes the fight take longer which means you need more hard healing but there are more volcanics and thus it self perpetuates itself into an absolute stupid amount of damage the only way we were able to do it was to just chain all our cds just right and win with certain rng
wow,not_removed,oh mb i didnt see i though he said healer did average on short mm fights
wow,not_removed,oh i see thanks i didnt done kara yet and neither in bc so i couldnt comprehend because i understood the following cc tap pool
wow,not_removed,its million damage iirc also we did the fight with dps healers and a tank so two dps are enough to down the shield theyre in the of ilvl for reference
wow,not_removed,the problem is that people do not understand mechanics and stand in the damned consecrate rather than tapping it
wow,not_removed,our problem was bringing melee players chaining the holy bolt thing
wow,not_removed,similar we oneshot maiden but spent wipes on final boss
wow,not_removed,yup makes you immune to fear saps and incaps and charms
wow,not_removed,my druid was intended to be resto but i use bear for a lot of things i rushed that talent before continuing my ghanir
wow,not_removed,yeah i havent even unlocked either of the agi artifacts but maybe i need that
wow,not_removed,if a shadow or disc priest does some amount of healing with shadowmend meaning you are not at full hp when they cast the dot that puts on you will break you out of repentance
wow,not_removed,well read the description it can also remove the bleed from being speared on first boss in eoa
wow,not_removed,definitely going to use this since my friend is our healer and hes new so hes having trouble keeping up with the group dot
wow,not_removed,would be scared to try it incase it didnt work 😂😂
wow,not_removed,its more amusing that you can use ice block to get out of that ice block
wow,not_removed,and then you get the cloak legendary and the whole goal is to run yourself dry and suicide to get full mana and immunity to mechanics for seconds that cloak lets you cheese so many mechanics
wow,not_removed,believe me he didnt die intentionally once he died on for last boss and didnt top me off im tank
wow,not_removed,i prefer the chastise stun talent instead of afterlife for dungeons far from useless
wow,not_removed,censure is pretty great in dungeons though
wow,not_removed,we went through at least mass repentance last night you wont have all of these cds back up in time to heal through stacks of that debuff on multiple people point is you only need stack to break the mass repentance stun so you shouldnt have more than that
wow,not_removed,why do you stand in fire all the time stand anywhere else omg help soak the fucking pools how the hell do you even get hit by that you peeve if shit damned idiotic aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh
wow,not_removed,pc load letter what the hell does that mean
wow,not_removed,i do the same i try to minimize the downtime between trashes so i drink regularly only a few seconds between pulls i catchup with a serenity so its fine that and chugging mana potions all the time
wow,not_removed,our healer just had to let our lowest dps die so she could focus on the remaining people when the garrotes got too high triage
wow,not_removed,high m is the only place where the spec is a reasonable choice high m is not what this thread is about
wow,not_removed,it would be so cool to have detailed logs of peoples performance when theyre playing world of warcraft like some sort ofwarcraftlogs youre right though for now well just have to be impressed by peoples pretend performance
wow,not_removed,except it isnt negligable no way he is healing that fast it just isnt happening also there is no excuse to get stacks
wow,not_removed,unless you tell the healer to not touch you any dmg u take they will be worrying about
wow,not_removed,rdruid has been the faceroll healing spec for years
wow,not_removed,on top of that if a dps misses it you will probably wipe since she casts a spell that needs to be interrupted which has a shield that needs to be broken if a dps gets ccd probably wont break the shield and your group gets one shot
wow,not_removed,i mustve had a shitty group then i was tanking as blood dk with dps and healer and everytime one dps died we couldnt pop the shield
wow,not_removed,i did it with a full melee group as long as they spread out square one on each side at max melee range it doesnt chain
wow,not_removed,kara seems particularly hard on melee its kind of ridiculous
wow,not_removed,charms instead of incaps i think
wow,not_removed,i chose the one at the bottom first i am wondering if i should reset or just continue on getting that second maybe i should just wait
wow,not_removed,yea i knew that but it often doesnt work on boss mechanics so i didnt want chance it and cause a wipe ex garrote is a bleed but it doesnt work on moroes
wow,not_removed,it does not have tried have failed ice block on the other hand
wow,not_removed,you dont get full mana when you come back
wow,not_removed,if youre getting three your dps is low
wow,not_removed,so you are saying that as a dps i should take more damage than i need to i thought healers liked having big meters
wow,not_removed,yeah i think its also a dps check as well much like ursoc over one it just gets too much
wow,not_removed,and mythic which this one falls under the increased mobility and healing would greatly benefit you as a healer too an affliction warlock in your group has no need to sit in fire when they can run right away while refreshing dots you wouldnt be complaining about the affliction warlock because they have no excuse for sitting still
wow,not_removed,my group picked up a pug healer for this last night and we made it all the way up to before people called it quits to get some sleep im going to brag that i was fighting the monk for top dps most of the night in my affliction spec but concede that even i managed to get stacks of of the debuff during the maiden of virtue fight because i didnt pay attention to an overlapping circle i apologized to the healer and we cleared it the next pull i also understood how hard it was for the healer to identify the actual debuff during the attumen stable fight and we did our best to assist them with raid symbols and having that person run to the healer i understand what you meant much better now
wow,not_removed,no but i can teach you how to dougie
wow,not_removed,as affliction with any heals from the healer it is negligible if you are playing affliction as i do you probably have enough drain life uptime to heal a substantial amount with minimal outside help if you add siphon life to it you need even less
wow,not_removed,not truehpal was even more easymode during wod button healing hooooooooo but yeah rdruid is pretty easy
wow,not_removed,not saying it wasnt close every time because it was but we did it i just had to help the healer out as she was having a difficult time with all the consecrate damage flying around even with just one stack per person
wow,not_removed,curator
wow,not_removed,depending on how far along you are resetting is going to be painful but that talent is so important not quite as important as ashes to ashes is to retadins but its up there
wow,not_removed,but the moroes garrote isnt labelled as a bleed effect so it is logical that stone form doesnt remove it
wow,not_removed,yeah i thought block would do it but was thinking if i both worked there would be ways to get out of it least block works
wow,not_removed,how much does it give if its a set amount its still great
wow,not_removed,and youre probably dead in the next shield phase because all the dps blew their cooldowns barely making it through the last one
wow,not_removed,its a dps check for sure being able to down all the adds and drop him before the garrotes stack too high for a healer to reasonably heal through on top of coat checks on the tank
wow,not_removed,itt aff locks that do not understand how hard the maidens dot hits
wow,not_removed,i might just wait i am probably a couple traits away and i am not having issues with m so it might not be worth it at this point i believe a reset would cost me
wow,not_removed,its just whatever you had before its still seconds of free casting
wow,not_removed,if you only get stack and have your dots already on maiden ie your good with timers you can easily keep yourself alive while doing substantial damage to help break maidens bubble
wow,not_removed,really my group killed maiden fairly easily and i was affliction and noticed how hard it hit knowing my class i also realized that i could mitigate a huge absolutely huge portion of the dot and then easily heal the rest within one drain life especially with siphon life up i think you may misunderstand how little damage warlocks take compared to the other casters regardless of damage going out
wow,not_removed,do you regen mana during the seconds
wow,not_removed,if you only get stack and have your dots already on maiden how would you even avoid this situation unless you just derp the mechanic and get stunned for stack on maiden is not avoidable damage its a required mechanic stacks on maidens means youre probably going to die unless your healer is spam healing you some fights have mechanics that you can ignore with personals or good self healing maidens isnt one of them
wow,not_removed,i look forward to the logs of you sustaining healing mitigation over
wow,not_removed,nope you rez with exact same amount
wow,not_removed,i was saying with stack and my dots up already i can keep myself alive with out attention from the healer
wow,not_removed,hm i suppose then its just the seconds of free heals still quite nice i think it resets your potion cooldown as well or sets it to instead of per fight or was that person in raid discussion just totally talking out of his ass
wow,not_removed,i have the legendary and it does allow you to pop your pots again so you can pop a mana pot right before you die get free heals for secs then when you res you can pop another mana pot a minute later
wow,not_removed,its a lot more than just seconds of free heal it saves m runs where you either survive and keep on going or rez the party after wipe it saves raid fights because people have one less cd to use then there are all the times you use it on purpose
wow,not_removed,i have it too but never tried it i thought it would work that way but wasnt sure thanks for the info
wow,not_removed,i dont think you do without certain addons the reason it is there is for added functionality if you click or right click on one of the yellow dots that passenger will be ejected from there you can have players jump on your mount
wow,not_removed,i use sexymap addon it can move vehicule seat armored man and objective tracker
wow,not_removed,this
wow,not_removed,even better item
wow,not_removed,recently did in feralas as a level removed all my gear and still onehitkilled every mob thankfully this little mechanical gorilla easily ground down the mob for me to where i could capture it
wow,not_removed,requires feast of winter veil save it for what
wow,not_removed,getting the ulduar raiding achievement is almost impossible at how the hell do i toast those dwarves when i cant get them down to health lol
wow,not_removed,thanks that will definitely come in handy hadnt thought of that
wow,not_removed,just out of curiosity has anyone tried it on like ragnaros yet
wow,not_removed,get the foam sword at dalaran toy shop
wow,not_removed,oh dear xd
wow,not_removed,it doesnt work in dungeons and raids
wow,not_removed,period that makes me sad oh well
wow,not_removed,personal loot
wow,not_removed,some people also will recommend taking a screenshot of the raid leader posting the rules but msos by itself without full definition and explanation wouldnt be enough as you seemed to have learn from your ticket if they dont specify the joke is my stuff others stuff also even if they explicitly define rules and proceed to break them it is pretty unlikely much will happen as its a grey area for gms there have been instances of gms taking action but many more instances of them saying they wont be getting involved dont join guild runs and expect to get priority over guild members they might even give a piece to someone that isnt specd for it just because they need that other role filled for raid dont stick with pugs unless the raid leader very clearly states loot rules or runs personal loot and always be aware unless its personal loot no matter how organized and professional one seems the raid leader can ultimately do what he wants if he doesnt care about his reputation he sure as shit into gonna give you a piece you need if he needs it himself really if you want a fair loot system you gotta join a guild or be down to buy multiple runs off a carry guild this is why many people arent full geared if theyre guildless and low on gold
wow,not_removed,join personal loot pugs or find a guild
wow,not_removed,i find if you wait tell the pug is full before pulling the boss ask in raid chat if you can roll on x item you want if it drops a couple things usually happen at this point that are a bunch of red flags someone not the raid leader responds if so get the raid leader to respond if they refuse drop the group they make a big deal about you asking drop the group they kick you they saved you time dropping the group this does happen and its a hilarious red flag they tell you the loot rules again and say you can roll chances are they wont ninja
wow,not_removed,start your own group and make your own rules
wow,not_removed,stealth detection potion sou you can identify the ninjas
wow,not_removed,so basically even if the stars align i wont ever get my gear back i should look for a guild but this late in the xpac every guild is vacant and i should try getting into the same raid group if possible
wow,not_removed,whenever i join a premade i insist on personal loot if the leader wont do it i just drop group not worth the risk
wow,not_removed,so what have you learned from this there should be some obvious other answers than the make your own raid
wow,not_removed,theres literally nothing you can do aside from not joining a master loot group unless you unconditionally trust the master looter people will come in and be like do personal loot or make your own group but thats not always practical especially if youre looking to get some mythic kills which are always run by at least a partial guild group using master looter so my recommendation would be to join a guild or at least become a permanent member of a raid group and avoid the whole pug thing because dealing with random people who will ninja andor not even pay attention to loot rolls is part of the pug experience
wow,not_removed,i dont go into a pug ever expecting to get loot i join up so i can use my bonus rolls for the week and if the group happens to be distributing loot then its a double bonus i usually end up adding the raid leaders that are good to my friends list and running with them frequently as well as running my own groups
wow,not_removed,the main issue here is blizzard taking the stance of not getting involved with loot issues like these if they could tell within good faith that someone did steal an item for themselves or a friend then the players should be actioned word would spread that blizzard grew a pair and it would be less widespread
wow,not_removed,yes but the problem is that they dont get punished i asked the gm i was talking to then what happens to me if i just make a archi group with ml and take everything he said you would lose your credibility so basically people can ninja archie and get away with it no problem and this is what really disturbs me fk the gear punish these type of people
wow,not_removed,people have gotten more and more greedy as things go forward in wow this became evident when i realized that out of nowhere everyone needs on every piece of loot in dungeons bcuz gold so if you actually need dungeon gear good luck and people defend that behavior when we used to universally condemn it your advice is solid back in mop during soo my buddy got my new ret paladin invited to a pug despite being under geared and having no tier set he promised i would do enough dps to compete with the top dps of the group i did and that i wouldnt die to mechanics i didnt except in wipes the raid leader of the group straight up gave me gear that i needed was completely fair when a warforged eye of galakras dropped and i ended up winning it but after shamans a trinket or neck cant remember which dropped and he gave it to himself and left screwing over the raid for mins until we could get everyone back i felt mixed emotions because that eye got me into many more good pugs afterwards and kept me outbursting everything but i hated that he did that to someone i dont see how someone can put together a group that is succeeding only to do that
wow,not_removed,personal loot however sad it is yes personal loot is the easiest counter against ninja loot masters and drama x
wow,not_removed,yeah if there were any
wow,not_removed,there isnt unless blizzard allow us to set our loot on a per group member basis
wow,not_removed,blizzards stance is actually that if loot rules are clearly stated and loot is then awarded differently they will remove the item from the ninjalooter they cant verify msos but if the rule is highest roller wins and the item is not rolled for or rolled for and not awarded to the highest roller you can report them they used to reassign loot also but that policy was changed a while ago so now they just delete them the only thing you need to do when joining a group is to have the leader clearly state the rules in the raid chat because afaik its not enough that it was in the lfg tool description the biggest issue is not that blizz doesnt have a policy on it the problem is that those who want to ninjaloot dont state any rules in the first place which means anything goes or that people dont bother reporting it both of these means its fairly easy to get away with ninjaing something
wow,not_removed,even if the rl gives full loot rules the most gms will do is remove the item from the ninja not distribute it to the rightful owner i dont believe i have ever heard of any ninja getting some sort of punishment in recent years ninjaing is still all upside since at worst you get an item taken away that you wouldnt have had in the first place at best an probably in most cases nothing happens to you or your item
wow,not_removed,i ran a whole hfc hc in pl items dropped from bosses a duplicate and a calamitys edge is that common items from bosses
wow,not_removed,i mean there is burn me once shame on you burn me twice shame on me next time i think hell know not to join a group that isnt a loot setting to his liking or join a guild or make a guild or make a raid plenty of options
wow,not_removed,no you misunderstand you literally have to draw out a contract with exact terms to clearly state loot rules for blizzard to action anyone blizzard blue post even said msos is too vague which is bullshit blizzard will not help you if the raid clearly stated ms os because blizz believes someone might interpret someone coming into a raid with their offspec wanting mainspec items that they arent currently playing as
wow,not_removed,dont know why u got downvoted it is common to have far less to drop from a boss than normal especially when someone decided to fill a raid with people who already looted the boss once that week the system does not work well when many in the group could use items off the bosses because more often than not the item is one they dont need or one that is bad for their spec
wow,not_removed,i dont think its because its vague their policy says they cant verify it its probably more like they cant see which spec you had active when you did the rolling i did say that though i would think something like this would be sufficiently clear highest roller wins loot will be distributed using master looter heres the actual policy httpsusbattlenetsupportenarticleninjalootingpolicy
wow,not_removed,on personal the loot is always based on the spec you have your loot specialty set to so it will always be for your spec whether or not you need the item that actually drops is another matter
wow,not_removed,you dont understand say your spec prioritizes critmastery theres cloaks in the current raid tier one with critmastery one with hastemulti you personal loot the hastemulti one completely useless to you if you have a slightly lower ilvl cloak with your correct stats
wow,not_removed,its not a dps legendary and doesnt have best secondaries its fine the way it is the utility is amazing
wow,not_removed,shield of vengeance didnt get buffed they just finally updated the tooltip log in use sov look at it log into ptr use it look at it no buff
wow,not_removed,i mean im using them so i wouldnt say no to a buff but im happy with how they are
wow,not_removed,you can put down world markers as well
wow,not_removed,how would this help anyone remember where they are youd still need to remember where the fish or the dildo is
wow,not_removed,to be fair he didnt make any claims about this actually helping you kill the boss just said it was great fun lol
wow,not_removed,rlookingforgroup
wow,not_removed,not a bad idea but i feel like itd be a small and slow sub the lfg tool is fine enough imo
wow,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomsubredditscreate
wow,not_removed,not quite the same in my mind i think of lfg as being a very non specific place to find random groups for things that i cant use the in game tool for successfully i certainly dont list keystones there because i feel like people lf keys wouldnt want to sift through the other junk there is why more suggesting rlfkeystones if anything from carries to specific keys to lf people to carry
wow,not_removed,im on mobile whats this suppose to link to
wow,not_removed,you can click links on mobile source on mobile
wow,not_removed,idk why it sends me to a login page on reddit but with terrible formatting
wow,not_removed,we just use personal loot
wow,not_removed,rc lootcouncil which works great as long as there are no selfish people that complains about not getting an item or refuses to update addons
wow,not_removed,i get the feeling that dkp is not modern anymore in strick man myth groups were everyone is always there and the core man group stays together of the time the loot should just be given to the one with the most needbenefit to push the group loot council is better imo
wow,not_removed,we all just roll for it
wow,not_removed,we use rclootcouncil with people voting over whos getting the item if you need an explanation how its working tell me until now no one complained
wow,not_removed,we use master loot although we have a fair loot system meaning that if person a and person b both plate people rolls on x item and person a wins he gets it if person a and person b rolls once more against one another person b gets prio since hes the one with no loot if they both had gotten item each its just the highest roll also raiders get prio over socials or casual people who show up once in a while it has worked fine so far
wow,not_removed,personal loot for farm raids boosts rc loot council for progression and mythic
wow,not_removed,my guild uses a master lootercouncil looter basically if an item drops that you want you bid for it by whispering the officer in charge with the item that you are currently using and other notes such as if the item in question is bis for your spec that group of people then decide based on a number of factors including things like your damage on that fight and in general attendance and how big of an upgrade it is for you personally i like not having to worry about playing my own guild mates for loot but it of course can have its problems i would absolutely never try and do this looting system unless the guild you are in is allready well established and has some history behind them due to how easily abusable this system is
wow,not_removed,i had same issue and questions regarding loot when we started forming my guild at the beguining of this expansiom we started with personal through hc raids and since we started doing mythics we transfered to master looter tho we decide as loot council who gets the loot depending alot of variables like raider trial attendence performance last time received loot bis item and so on it does help that we have people raid leading so each of us has some knowledge regarding some of bis lists we didnt have much problems regarding people sulking about loot even tho we are semi casual guild with alot of people getting mixed in in each myt run currently and not yet having problems hopefully i havent jinxed it ps sorry for misstypes fat fingers on a phone
wow,not_removed,we use personal it helps as we have a lot of leather and mail classes so they can swap gear as needed it also gives me a reason as the only plate dps to hoard all of the plate drops
wow,not_removed,we are using the arguably most sensible method a loot council that of course assumes that your officers are not only fair enough to not act based on preference but also have the class understanding to make a proper decision but i guess that a given in a progress oriented guild anyway personal loot is great for offspec runs cause it drops more items on average that you can then trade if needed since you will probably have something better in that slot on your mainspec
wow,not_removed,our guild is fairly small and fairly tight and does not use any addon basically when an item drops people who need is post their current gear in the guild chat then most people pass because its clear that its a bigger upgrade for someone else and if theres still more than person who wants it theres a loot council how that works is simply the gm calls out two random people who jump into their own chat with the gm and discuss who gets the item based on stuff like attendance current gear and how much theyve gottenpassed on before very informal certainly not something to recommend for bigger guilds or guilds where members are likely to get angry and leave over loot but quick and fair in our case
wow,not_removed,for progression we use loot council for farm content we use personal
wow,not_removed,we also use personal loot and then roll for stuff people dont need
wow,not_removed,we do too but we are a small xrealmguildgroup and it just saves time and drama we more or less switched when hfc came out and used ml before its not as efficient but blaming blizz for bad drips beats blaming the rl
wow,not_removed,also its better for progression our group has problem with some people being a bit stubborn about tactics and are making trivial mistakes and when a player dies on ursocs charge or refuse to jump on spiders on elethre then why should they get loot only cause they got a ton of dkp and thas one of my biggest concerns
wow,not_removed,totally agree our problem is that our group is not stable we are just casuall group of people that want to enjoy raiding and we are progressing en myth but everytime there are changes in people in my opinion dkp is really total bullshizzle and im trying convice others that loot council is really better
wow,not_removed,yes thats something between master looter and council and in my opinion it batter than dkp mailny because our dko system is dumb as phuk you get dkp even doing normal hc and mythin progress but our main raid group is focusing on myth why should you get dko for doing normal which is just brainless farm and its not even during our main raid time
wow,not_removed,we used something similar in our raids but people would hold off on rolling on gear because what if my super x item drops and i can no longer roll qq
wow,not_removed,i would absolutely never try and do this looting system unless the guild you are in is allready well established exactly this is our problem we have a hard time forming our myth group we have a lot of people that had been in our guild for a long time but they simply cant do myths with us ingame or rl probs and we want to have stable group of people no somestalesomerandom group
wow,not_removed,yep i think that sounds rly fair and one more thing how much time does it take to distribute loot like this our officers say it would take a lot of time but i dont think that should be a factor when it comes to loot which is sadly one of the key parts of progression
wow,not_removed,yea our whole group is made out of leather and ive rerolled from my dk to ww so when i look at our plates chillin at the pile of free plate gear i got tear in my eye
wow,not_removed,when building loot council we will be chosing fair players for each category of factor i can see that loot council is really popular and when other people are satisfied and dont have problem with it then we can do it also d
wow,not_removed,yeah indeed there are enough epics dropping anyway so if anyone needs we just roll or give away
wow,not_removed,yeah same main spec then offspec then if no one wants it still it goes to our enchanters and mats dumped in the bank works well for us
wow,not_removed,yeah and keeping track of peoples dkp seems really annoying
wow,not_removed,when your group is not stable having a dkp system actually benefits you veteran guys that stick around longer but it also drives away newbies that have to raid for several id´s before having the dkp balance to be able to bid on things in high demand
wow,not_removed,well it does take longer than personal that is for sure it takes us around mins a good thing is as said with couple of rls we split the work so while i continue clearing trash with majority of players who dont need loot one of rls stays and works on the loot distribution i think this is much safer way to work as you gear up people who are with you most of the time and as their gear goes up so can that of people whos attendance is a bit lower also one of things what pushed us in this direction is that items such as trinkets cant always be swapped due to ilvl and all those restrains where it will be more beneficial for one type of healer than the other
wow,not_removed,is it still true that if you use personal then more loot will drop
wow,not_removed,master looter is fixed at pieces per player this means a man group would get pieces per boss or guaranteed pieces plus chance at a one only loot eligible players count towards that formula so if someone did a boss this week already it falls down to chance for example on pl youll see a slight deviation above that so youll probably get pieces in a boss with the same group and possibly more with good luck its a tradeoff between controlling who gets lootfor dkpcouncil etc or getting more loot ml will be particularly useful on nighthold where tier pieces will drop and as a group youll want people getting bonus instead of wasting a drop for someone to get their piece
wow,not_removed,eh maybe we raid with people only so i cant speak for mythics since they are only and might drop more loot but we get per kill iirc not including bonus rolls
wow,not_removed,also personal is good to lower the gab between each member due to fact that you can trade only if you get lower ilvl drop so lower players will get all items that are useless for others
wow,not_removed,i dont know the answer to your question but nobody heals pets if theres a problem with your tank and a pet takes over sure heal it but healers dont heal pets
wow,not_removed,afaik hunterwarlock pets should show up with the default party frames minions not so much
wow,not_removed,to be fair i couldve easily theyre my last priority but when no one else needs my attention shrug
wow,not_removed,yes but they dont
wow,not_removed,for sure just saying you are not at all expected to
wow,not_removed,ow youre right the cvar is now disabled by default and the option was removed this command should enable party pets again run setcvarshowpartypets reloadui
wow,not_removed,because there is one order hall class set so its a mix of every stats for each spec
wow,not_removed,first off haste is only top for aoe dps for balance druids int is most important haste is a close you only need about haste to be good after hastes you only notice a or seconds difference in cast speed not a huge deal at ilvl gear i run haste and mastery and can pull dps st and about aoe just got to play it right
wow,not_removed,if haste is your concern i wouldnt look at the nighthold tier gear
wow,not_removed,boomkin is gimped by gear this expansion i started as boomkin and had to go heal and tank since i never got to a haste value that let me play effectively without haste you will be a waste of space in mythic but hey masterymost useless stat for owl but you get a free or some
wow,not_removed,ha haha crit is the dominant stat in the warrior set subjectively influenced perception soa mix for not a single spec
wow,not_removed,okay thats good input my guild is really small now and were a ways from doing mythics so its not critical for me to be top tier but ive always tried to play my char as well as possible so i appreciate the information
wow,not_removed,haste and mastery would be fine for each spec
wow,not_removed,everybody wouldve loved them for distributing mainly haste and mastery with a little splash of crit and vers in between
wow,not_removed,we wiped at on mythic botanist once while working on progression it was very painful
wow,not_removed,i hope its mythic lol
wow,not_removed,damn and i thought wiping at on hc guldan was bad p
wow,not_removed,its normalheroic because on the last phase there isnt of them only
wow,not_removed,hp wipe on heroic guldan after which we proceeded wioe for the rest of the night many sad
wow,not_removed,the emerald dreamway is hands down my favorite place this xpac
wow,not_removed,also this is edited with a free program
wow,not_removed,looks amazing im playing on absolute min settings and some of the screenshots i see here look like theyre from another game
wow,not_removed,it would be awesome if there was some sort of addon that could stylize the world to make it look more like what you have pictured here you have a good eye good work
wow,not_removed,same here
wow,not_removed,ikr ive been playing low settings for as long as i can remember and only recently gotten a better pc to heighten my graphics def worth the money if you ever get a chance
wow,not_removed,thanks i wish for sure and yes i have a lot more screenshots like this might just get an album together for you guys
wow,not_removed,profession mounts do count towards the achievements
wow,not_removed,does server matter in this scenario say i level tailoring on area will my main on kiljaeden get credit
wow,not_removed,this is what i thought as well i checked on my char that does have the tailoring mounts then one that didnt and the mount progress was the same on both maybe they changed it edit oddly i checked my horde character as i have warlords deathwheel and the number was still the same
wow,not_removed,yes because its an account wide mount also rep to kj that was my first ever server
wow,not_removed,well thanks man most appreciated
wow,not_removed,open your spellbook default hotkey for it is p i believe find the ability from there and drag it back
wow,not_removed,god i wish i could be new to the game again like this
wow,not_removed,thank you
wow,not_removed,couldnt there be an item like stirrups those will help you stay longer on your mount when you are under attack
wow,not_removed,areal
wow,not_removed,you are amazing on my way to the auctioneer
wow,not_removed,its like an area but more real
wow,not_removed,a super cereal area like so super cereal
wow,not_removed,lava lash costs not and cant proc stormbringer or windfury
wow,not_removed,ahyea i had my mouse over the wrong tooltipcan crash lightning proc those things
wow,not_removed,guy must be a mmochampion veteran
wow,not_removed,each expac tends to have a character that leads us into the next one wrathion from mop into wod guldan from wod into legion i wouldnt be surprised to see xera lead us into a void themed expac
wow,not_removed,i wouldnt be shocked if she was corrupt in some way though i do believe illidan is good him destroying the legion helps us and the void gods since sargeras is one of the only forces working against them in honesty would love for us to return from argus to find the old gods full out corrupting azeroths soul
wow,not_removed,well xera is a naaru being if im not mistaken and naaru are literally living void creatures that were able to purify themselves to become holy again however at the end of their lives they fall back into the corruption the naaru are technically evil creatures that purified themselves so there could be some unconscious motive behind xeras actions
wow,not_removed,more complicated than that it goes back to the nature of light and the void within warcraft theyre the two sources from which all other energy truly originate all planes of existence and all life naaru were titanforged beings of pure light who can fall to the void because they exist on that lightshadow border just like discipline priests bend the line between inner darkness and holy fire to smite their enemies so too do the naaru entropius and the voidy from wod are simply the end cycle of a naaru life span tldr naaru are cyclical not just purified void gods a la the pally dreadlord lightgod
wow,not_removed,ive been trying to figure out what this place is for for about minutes when i walk up to the location it says something like find the budding tree but beware of the hungry fish or something like that i could not find anything and when i walked into the circles the fish didnt attack me
wow,not_removed,its used for a quest theres a path downstream with a dryad theyve just missed removing the actual quest notifications when you arent on it
wow,not_removed,thanks was driving me crazy
wow,not_removed,tich and illidan tich has like guilds and some
wow,not_removed,me and my buddies moved to hyjal back in november and we love it if you want a pve realm id recommend hyjal if you want pvp i would go tich
wow,not_removed,thrall isnt bad great community and decent progression
wow,not_removed,i just rolled on arthas and im liking it a lot so far
wow,not_removed,i would look on wowprogress you can check realm pop and ratio and check for guild progression to see if there are guilds that are actually progressing
wow,not_removed,ok thanks do you know if i faction change mid week if i will lose my highest mythic key stone i did a this week
wow,not_removed,if i were choosing a realm today with the knowledge that i have now i would definitely roll on hyjal sadly i actually like my guild and have and and dont want to restart from nothing
wow,not_removed,just realized that in the west in terms of simmed dps the top are all fury warrs then one outlaw then almost all warrs for pages
wow,not_removed,no clue
wow,not_removed,do you play on tich last night it showed it as a medium pop realm it was late but the stormrage and other servers said full you think tich is low pop or do people there just log early lol
wow,not_removed,yep it sucks lost my key to a tank dc on one of the first trash pulls didnt even get to a boss
wow,not_removed,ask your guild mates to do some together during the weekend
wow,not_removed,or you could recharge your key
wow,not_removed,good luck getting randoms to run a depleted key
wow,not_removed,for valor lol
wow,not_removed,i this kind of tank never their fault
wow,not_removed,its always the tanks that disappear quicker than vanilla ices career that blame the healers
wow,not_removed,smugness and stupidity combined just admit fault you will not be persecuted for it
wow,not_removed,yupam a healerthis happens a lot
wow,not_removed,as a healer this is amazing and hilarious
wow,not_removed,when the tank is one shot its the tanks fault
wow,not_removed,example of t he details you want cleared up sometimes stuff is cleared up in novels and such
wow,not_removed,i think those cut minutes would be just enough
wow,not_removed,reboots are popular
wow,not_removed,could be fps or wifiwire connection or route tofrom blizzard servers
wow,not_removed,possible problems you are on wifi and someone in your vicinity is using a microwave oven stop using wifi while gaming you have high fps lag due to throttling get something like httpwwwcpuidcomsoftwareshwmonitorhtml and check your components temperature and what is acceptable for each try to lower the graphicsimprove cooling its a good idea to clean out pcs and laptops every few monthsyearsswitch out bottlenecks some software on your pc uses up most of your network speed task manager will tell you what it is your router is overheating and dying you have a shit isp fire up a httpwwwspeedtestnet and check your ping when you experience the lag again your uploaddownload speed should not affect much unless its extremely low less than mbps change isp
wow,not_removed,there is no reason not to run millhousead the only missions worth doing are bluepurple equipment missions high gold missions and all ap missions its rare to have more than one or two of these up at a time
wow,not_removed,im running milhouse ad kalec esara meryl i dont find milhouses longer mission time to be too annoying because there usually arent more than a few missions that are worth doing up at any one time i tend to do only apgold missions or champion item if its any good i like your setup but if i want to switch it will take some time because my rav is only it might be to much bother
wow,not_removed,i disagree with not having the arcane destroyer equipped ive been finding that hero is probably my most valuable it can easily solo many missions brute forcing if need be that last longer than hours even on ones it cant get straight up it still adds like success chance alongside another follower
wow,not_removed,im never running more than missions at a time so having millhouse doesnt bother me
wow,not_removed,ive taken to modera though shes on practically permanent bodyguard duty because i got lucky with the legendary equipment that gives gold and or when you complete wqs with a combat ally esara meryl destroyer and kalec main focus is on using equipment that gives a flat chance buff or a bonus if theyre with a specific type of troop since i so rarely absolutely need to unassign modera how horribly inefficient am i
wow,not_removed,i run millhouse arcane destroyer archmage vargoth archmage kalec and archmage modera modera is permanently my combat ally due to getting a legendary equip forbher that gives order resources then i just combo kalec with vargoth and a kirin tor invoker and millhouse with the arcane destroyer and an invoker for on most missions i definitely have some knstances where i only get but with mostly rare and uncommon equips on them long duration boots long duration potion epic invoker buff and rareuncommon invoker buff i chose this combo because i felt that meryl was pretty average i love millouse and arcane destroyer matched it too well i could have put verrinde or ravandwyr in for kalec but hes got counterspell and verrinde is counter productive with the duration reduction
wow,not_removed,as an example i can all of them without too much trouble and i dont have to rely on any consideration of mission duration or the millhousearcane destroyer combo nbsp httpiimgurcomhbpdmajjpg httpiimgurcomyjgzhmljpg httpiimgurcomtvqjgwejpg nbsp also this is done with a that has one of his equipment slots filled with a order hall resources item since he moonlights as a combat ally for me so things might be even easier if i filled his second slot with another mission success item
wow,not_removed,there is no reason not to run millhousead nbsp whats the reasoning behind this nbsp my reasoning not to use the millhousead combo is that i can still all my missions without them so the advantage is that i have the ability to run more missions in a given amount of time and still them
wow,not_removed,thats definitely a solid setup for nailing those ideal missions i guess i just like the freedom that my setup allows me while still being able to anything
wow,not_removed,ads ability only gives a success chance that really doesnt seem that compelling compared to kalec and vargoth who will instead will get their success chance on a larger number of missions nbsp my guess is that the equipment you have on ad is what is really making him valuable personally id rather be able to any mission easily not just hrs ones
wow,not_removed,wouldnt running fewer missions at a time make millhouse more annoying since it will be so long until you can run your next mission nbsp but yeah he is definitely powerful
wow,not_removed,same i frequently without much thought deploy my guys on two missions that both have close to win percent i also like having vargoth as a combat minion because his buff is crazy when world questing
wow,not_removed,yeah i often just keep him as my combat ally too
wow,not_removed,i managed to get lucky on my dh and get the resources one but no other toon has gotten better than a combo edit oh and nice guide i think this is the set up i use are there any other specific items you use on your mission followers
wow,not_removed,the reasoning is missions worth doing are few and far between at most you should only need two teams millhousead is a two man team that will guarantee on nearly any mission while leaving you with a three man team for any side missions
wow,not_removed,slightly different setup than you as all my followers have chance with invokers and chance on long missions millhouse essential in that he can lengthen short missions to get the bonus from my long mission equipped items as others have said i dont have enough good missions to run to be impeded by increased length
wow,not_removed,once you have leveled geared and equipped your champions there are very few missions worth spending resources on if you are a higher ilvl youre not really doing wqs and just doing m there arent that many sources of resources its better to just have your champs spend as long as they need who cares how long they take when there is maybe only five a week to even run
wow,not_removed,as far as equipment goes for most of my champions kalec vargoth felstorm ravandwyr i start them off with lucky doodad chance conjurers bauble chance w invokers and move towards lucky doodad chance auspicious fetish chance or arcanists trifle chance w invokers nbsp for modera i start with lucky doodad chance band of primordial strength chance w water elementals and move to lucky doodad chance highborne bauble chance w water elementals nbsp for millhouse and arcane destroyer i start with lucky doodad chance bottomless flask for hrs and go to lucky doodad chance vial of timeless breath for hrs nbsp i know i could double down on some of the situational bonuses but i like my champions to be as versatile as possible nbsp tldr nbsp most champions nbsp archmage modera nbsp millhouse and arcane destroyer
wow,not_removed,still you are preventing yourself from being able to run more missions in a given amount of time even if you dont value the rewards for the other missions rep bloods of sargeras raiddungeon loot these rewards are still better than nothing which is what you are getting with mhad nbsp if my team can already guarantee on any mission why should i disadvantage myself by fielding a team that frequently doubles my mission time
wow,not_removed,what makes you not want to do some of the other missions i get the rep ones being useless if all your alts have maxed rep but apart from that every mission has a potentially valuable reward
wow,not_removed,i am swimming in order hall resources and i fully upgraded my order hall set in case they ever allow further upgrades and buy my weekly seals with resources i have a hybrid vargoth setup with the resources item equipped often i switch him to a combat ally when i do my wqs all i do is the minimum for the emissary caches which you should be doing if you care about legendaries and i have more resources than i know how to spend nbsp additionally all of the missions still hold value for me nbsp gold missions gold raiddungeon missions wftf gear seals artifact power missions ap bonuses are especially potent champion equipment missions chance at epiclegendary champion equipment champion armament missions stockpile for raised champion ilvl cap reputation missions boa tokens for alts blood of sargeras missions gold pvp missions marks of honor for transmog nbsp i guess if you dont care about any of these things then you can go with a mhad setup but even then is there any way that it is more effective than the one i have proposed both can any mission but mine can do it faster furthermore if someone happens to care about any of the things above then it becomes even more valuable to be able to do missions efficiently
wow,not_removed,already exalted on both of my with everyone and the only rep that matters is nightfallen for blood of sargeras grab boon of the bloodhunter and you will drown in the stuff raiddungeon quest items is qhat my b team is for and these missions are somewhat rare i suffer no disadvantage for using mhad because the missions that are actually worth something arent common i see no value in doing missions just to do them
wow,not_removed,i never responded to this and you probably dont care anymore but at the time i checked i had quests for follower items i dont need a vow chest which doesnt reward useful gear although i guess i should grab it for the one in a million chance at titanforge an area invitation i dont do much pvp and zero arena and an augment rune i have a ton i do lfr weekly for those so i havent found that many of the quests are worth it but i could have bad luck or i could be held back by not getting my deactivated followers to ilevel i do all ap and gold quests and that seems to be about per day
wow,not_removed,i suffer no disadvantage for using mhad nbsp i guess its just no disadvantage that you care about i think many other people do care about some of these other rewards or additional chances at equipment nbsp youve said that theres no reason not to choose mhad but i would counter by saying that i see no reason to chose them nbsp even if you dont run any of the missions you dont care about isnt it just a convenience to have your missions done sooner plus then you can do multiple missions faster if you do happen to get a handful that you consider good it seems that both setups can any mission so i guess i am just asking if there is any downside to not using the mhad combo
wow,not_removed,fair enough i guess i do enough pvp and transmogging to want the pvp mission i would do the follower missions for chances at legendary follower equipment the dungeon chest for the tf chance like you said and the augment rune could be sold for gold nbsp i definitely agree that these missions offer rewards that are far below the apgold missions however to me theyre not totally useless but on the other hand if you dont feel like they are worth the resource investment thats totally fine
wow,not_removed,personally i use milhouse instead of meryl in your team i dont use arcane destroyer the synergy is only great in paper you wont always send those together so its wasted part of a time with ad you have arcane champions and only milhouse as fire send him in a long mission and you have no fire counter for a lot of time still milhouse is a must for a big reason every hours mission becomes a missions and all your items are activated in the end i use milhouse ravandwyr this blood elf has a win against minions which is worth the from arcane destroyer in most missions same reasoning as original guide with aoe counters with ravandwyr i also have two fire champions so i can send milhouse and still have another fire counter
wow,not_removed,still milhouse is a must for a big reason nbsp but if i can already any mission is there any reason to use him nbsp i think the reason people like the mhad combo is that you can throw them at literally any mission longer than hrs before the millhouse doubling and you end up getting a bonus mission success chance nbsp millhouse verbose grandstanding bottomless flask vial of timeless breath nbsp arcane destroyer charged core bottomless flask vial of timeless breath nbsp total nbsp so you can basically throw this combo at any mission and they will it which is nice from a fireandforget perspective if you dont really care about many mission rewards nbsp however if i can already any mission anyway i dont see why it would be worth hindering myself in the mission duration department
wow,not_removed,becuase millhouse is a chill brah id never bench him
wow,not_removed,and if its a money grab like the last twothree so what does that even mean literally everything any business does is for money
wow,not_removed,in my opinion this is the best expansion thats dropped in a long time heaps of endgame content very well thought out nothing like wod
wow,not_removed,also you can now buy sub time with in game gold so if you get up and running you can avoid the recurring fee with some farming
wow,not_removed,i never had the drive to hit the level cap in both vanilla and cata but this expansion has got me playing way past that no idea if i might get bored in weeks but i have been playing hours a day
wow,not_removed,i agree with arthurus on this
wow,not_removed,i think you should not come back the way you are talking about it makes me think it is not the game for you anymore people can grow out of games and believe it or not
wow,not_removed,yeah your attitude sucks about it but yes this expax is great
wow,not_removed,uh huh yeah dont come back youre clearly still in love your nostalgic feelings for oldschool wow and if you come back youre just going to get pissy and shitpost about how much better vanilla was in two weeks save yourself the time and the and go play something else im not trying to sound like a knob there i really truly mean that we already have enough people romanticizing the past on this sub we dont need any more of it
wow,not_removed,tormentorum is a fucking godawful shitshow without logs hard to say if it was healing or not but it could very easily not be your fault on that boss if things go bad
wow,not_removed,cant say without watching tbh it depends on a lot of things it could be that the dps arent stunning or interrupting enough it could be bad pulls it could be wrong class match up it could be that indeed your skills are lacking i run with earthshield totem on my shaman but thats not as highly geared as you rsham is also my alt so i dont really know all i know is that it does wonders for reducing the pressure of bigbadpainful pulls
wow,not_removed,was this on american servers when you have sang and volcanic if so every group ive been in for or higher vault have been hitting a massive wall on that boss ive had many groups tellign me its not my healing thats the issue and im inclined to beleive them
wow,not_removed,id honestly put it more down to that boss more than anything saying your ilvl doesnt really help much because of how poor that reflects your actual gear in legion pls give us back reforging blizzard
wow,not_removed,if dps are taking that much damage then they are probably taking avoidable damage people love to blame the healer i couldnt tell you for sure if it was your fault or not without watching the fight in question though
wow,not_removed,i just did vow this morning we had sanguine volcanic fortified i highly doubt this is your fault from lack of healing my group took about an hour and minutes in this dungeon due mostly to this second boss of the instance for reference group ilvls were prot pally shadow priest bm hunter havoc dh resto druid me one big thing is the volcanic the volcanic spawns in the big clusterfuck of the melee this nearly everyone melee also arent used to getting volcanic and watching for it as much because its a ranged mechanic but they spawn from the eyes that daze you too so melee gets hit throw the volcanic pools in with people getting dazed the fel guard stunning people and all the other stuff people are watching and theyre bound to get hit we lost our dh early in every attempt mostly because he stood in volcanics we also had to use hero as soon as the fel guard came out and chain stunned him and burned his ass down people need to realize you need to burn a global to get rid of soul sap too they cant get dazed you cant get dazed everyone needs to avoid the pools and kill the adds asap its rough but doable
wow,not_removed,a huge issue is people generally wont help interrupt on the second boss if other people are going down its only like your fault a lot of the damage is avoidable is fine for up to probably but wil really need the group assisting with stuns and interupts edit for the people that dont know im not talking about boss interupts and you can cancel soul sap with toys
wow,not_removed,yeah hes pretty hard on the tank and at if you get disoriented by the eye its probably a wipe
wow,not_removed,you cant interrupt the boss on mythic
wow,not_removed,it wasnt until reading this comment has i clicked with me that the fucking soul sap is interruptable
wow,not_removed,you can interrupt the void bolt and mind flay and stun basically everything else in the fight
wow,not_removed,it is on normal and heroic i think mythic and higher it is not
wow,not_removed,this is why dbm changes from interrupt to stop casting when you go from heroic to mythic
wow,not_removed,all i know is i recall seeing the little lightning bolt thinknig next to the dbm timer and i never put and together shrug
wow,not_removed,sometimes
wow,not_removed,yep
wow,not_removed,how do people play dps without tankhealer friends who are down to queue with them i assume they just have to become good at sucking ds if they want to raid or do mythic
wow,not_removed,a big part of the problem is that dps are so replaceable when i lead a pug i have to be harder on dps because if a tank leaves thats at least minutes but wait less than and an dps will show up and people dont like waiting so its easier to just please the minority to get through a raid it hurts me especially as a dps myself because i know how hard it is to get into groups even worse is m anything over and you better be a mage or hunter if youre dps
wow,not_removed,pay attention to the descriptions on groups and just click apply on everything shit on a shovel type approach then away a picture on reddit can people seriously not read requirements im a mage though so i probs get an easier time for over the top aoe damage and tw
wow,not_removed,no its a one time requirement per character you need the legionnaire or knightcaptain achievement
wow,not_removed,im in the exact same situation on my dh i made a ticket the other day but they havent been any help yet
wow,not_removed,are you positive you dont have something in your bags to take you to or i had the same problem but i had finally found something in my bags that did it
wow,not_removed,so let me understand this i took a break after launch got to so if i farm order resources i could buy ak levels up to
wow,not_removed,i have the same issue with my rogue they are stuck at knowledge with no option to research or anything awaiting a ticket response
wow,not_removed,i had the same issue i was stuck at and i couldnt research it any further and khadgar had nothing to say i opened a ticket and they were able to solve it for me it took a while but they managed to figure it out eventually it seems like youre going to have to open a ticket and wait for them to help you the gm i talked to said khadgar almost seems to think you are already at level knowledge power xx so something seems up can you please log back into your mage now and check your artifact knowledge level you should be near khadgar and he should have a quest for you seems the hotfix we had to speed up artifact research marked you as being level but never gave you the level so you were in a weird limbo
wow,not_removed,i made a ticket too i had to explain again to a different gm and im waiting
wow,not_removed,or its on the ground next to the ak person
wow,not_removed,if hes at already then he needs to go do the quest that khagdar gives you then it will send you back to the ak lady in your oh i cant remember if the ak npc or khagdar actually give you ak but i know for sure there is nothing can click in your bags to get to if just happens after you complete the quest if hes done the khagdar quest andor the next quest in the chain as well then its got to be a bug its possible hes still at and didnt learn the notes that blizzard fixed to auto complete yesterday you need to learn those then go to the broken shore and talk to khagdar my dk was in the same boat yesterday but after i used the ak research note khagdar finally gave me the quest
wow,not_removed,yep actually i dont really know how it works on you first griding character cuz when i did my ak levelling i did it in the normal and progressive way my guildies told me once that now you can buy the inicial levels with order resources
wow,not_removed,i am waiting too if you get a fix please told me gonna post here when they answer me
wow,not_removed,and what they did sent you the missing levels
wow,not_removed,nothing there sir
wow,not_removed,will do lets hope this issue is cleared up soon
wow,not_removed,the gm asked me to get onto another character for a while which i guess was for around minutes after he solved it he just asked me to get back on my mage and voila i was at and placed infront of khadgar and could accept the quest for
wow,not_removed,hey boss blizzard just answered and they fixed the npc is showing the quest to buy ak with or again hope that you got you fix too
wow,not_removed,still awaiting a ticket response but shouldnt be much longer hopefully good to hear your issue got resolved though
wow,not_removed,what are you talking about
wow,not_removed,there were no changes for destro to nerf
wow,not_removed,focused chaos changed from to entrenched changed from to seconds undocumented and not updated in tooltips yet
wow,not_removed,its pvp they are talking about
wow,not_removed,focused chaos down to entrenched seconds to seconds shadow burn damage reduced by
wow,not_removed,dude these are not changes they are happening in todays or already happened in todays downtime
wow,not_removed,oh sorry ive not even tried destro in pvp since early wrath im more of an affliction fan in that respect but as with everything blizzard dont do gentle nerfs they bulldoze a spec and then put it up a bit next time round sucks to be honest but thats just how it is
wow,not_removed,shadowburn nerf is for pvp only while these changes are not ideal theyre being rolled out today they were not rolled out last week
wow,not_removed,well since they gave them a massive godly buff this isnt a nerf per say as its still more damage than before
wow,not_removed,your browser is broke out of date
wow,not_removed,just look up appearances on sitstaysquirrel google arms warrior artifact appearances sitstaysquirrel for example
wow,not_removed,we had an issue after our latest datapush and just fixed it this afternoon in fact clearing cache should solve it otherwise it can take up to hours for the page to update on its own i did force an update on the prot paladin page in the image though if the calc doesnt work for some reason you can head on over to httpswwwwowheadcomartifactweaponguides and the pages for each artifact will have images and videos of all tints for that artifact
wow,not_removed,i use firefox just checked and it is up to date
wow,not_removed,oh my gosh you are fantastic thank you so much thats great i forgot that you had other sources but of course you do thanks
wow,not_removed,oh mylanta my name is janelle
wow,not_removed,dear bot how do we deal with a shitpost or shitposts this guy is complaining about a game he hasnt even played yet
wow,not_removed,i imagine if you used the lockout trick that would work people still use that for icc
wow,not_removed,find a decent tv show to watch while youre waiting for lore shit took me a few months of trying times a week finally finished awake the drakes last night cheer
wow,not_removed,literally shot every boss except spine lol
wow,not_removed,its only like minutes like someone said lol
wow,not_removed,since no one has brought it up does anyone know if the macro trick works on heroic deathwing it was broken during the legion prepatch iirc but is it still broken or is there another way around it for those who didnt know you cant use the lockout trick to do heroic deathwing you get a message saying you must clear the prior bosses on heroic before switching difficulty to heroic even if you were extending a lockout that was cleared in heroic to get around this you could use the lockout trick to get to the deathwing fight then use a macro to swap difficulty and click begin in the dialog with thrall so the difficulty was switched at the same time the fight started instead of a minute clear on an alt it let you kill deathwing on heroic every or so minutes so it was a ton faster if you were clearing for mounts with a lot of alts
wow,not_removed,takes like minutes to run through the place if it werent for pickle orc and all his talking it could be done in why not just run it every week and make some gold
wow,not_removed,dude you are a druid you have forms and stuff also eat the food bear tartare when you kill a mob any mob you get speed increase
wow,not_removed,it does work but as of the first couple weeks of legion it was very fickle with how you did it due to spine being the dominating factor
wow,not_removed,doesnt work for hc in dragon soul though so no chance at lifebinders handmaiden
wow,not_removed,the bosses arent really the problem the running around time is
wow,not_removed,when you have multiple characters that mins adds up pretty darn quick its also closer to mins than spine and the fight before it take nearly minutes each on top of all the other rp travel time etc
wow,not_removed,iirc the blazing drake drops off normal as well as heroic so it shouldnt matter if thats all ops going for
wow,not_removed,i definitely doesnt feel like fifteen minutes
wow,not_removed,the trick i used to sorta skip the dialogue when u first get to the top of the temple is to immediately take the portal back down to the base then fly back up the portal to eoe will have spawned when you get to the top even though theyre still in the middle of the rp that supposed to finish before kalec opens it its just a few seconds of saved time but everything counts
wow,not_removed,is it really only minutes i feel both the boat and then spine are at least minutes each and all the waiting time for rp talk i will time with different toons tonight
wow,not_removed,if you want the mounts and run it on multiple characters that minutes adds up fast
wow,not_removed,that literally doesnt help one bit in ds
wow,not_removed,ahh i see ive never done the lockout method myself i always just run through do you happen to know if the portal trick works with ds still where you can skip some of the dialogue at the top of the wyrmrest accord
wow,not_removed,the freaking talking scenes on top of the temple can skip cuts but not the rp talking ok kalecgos open the freaking portal yes im back minutes later and yes i had luck ok thrall shut up and make the purple dragons come that i can run around using instants on ok deathwing time dragons you have already told me all this stuff like times just let me talk to thrall again so i can start this stupid battle that lasts seconds
wow,not_removed,whos fault is that d
wow,not_removed,oh true i missed that im still interested if anyone has a new working method for heroic because im only missing the lifebinder mount from dragon soul
wow,not_removed,lol i cant disagree with that
wow,not_removed,hey i just shot that time out there as a guess im actually interested in how long it takes make sure to tell us
wow,not_removed,it still works
wow,not_removed,pray tell what portal trick
wow,not_removed,wow i honestly hadnt remembered to try that in ages now im sorry i cant help there been too aggravated with arthas and elegon to go back to ds despite that drake being the last i need for the meta
wow,not_removed,when you first get to the top of the tower and kalec starts talking you can shorten the scenario by taking the portal down to the base of the temple and flying back up taking secs off the rp or so
wow,not_removed,fuck off dude
wow,not_removed,well even if you dont have mutliple chars the time still adds up week by week p
wow,not_removed,ok after a bunch of wine mage got to boats got to dw looted dw dh got to boats got to dw looted dw dk got to boats got to looted dw hunter got to boats got to dw looted dw thanks for entertaining me during these runs and post edit and like every week no mounts
wow,not_removed,when you get to the top of the tower you can teleport back to the start then back to the tower and you can skip the rp dialogue where they open a portal to the eye for you
wow,not_removed,youll get it one day i believe in you
wow,not_removed,so not minutes minutes
wow,not_removed,handynotes the halloween addon then just fly from one to the next maybe hours for all of them
wow,not_removed,for a transfer to whatever server you want or you can just pug with someone when you can raid
wow,not_removed,i live in japan i joined a us server with some of my friends and for a while raiding at was doable i worked night shift once it became not plausible i created my own guild basically the guild was for other people in my situation i was able to find people during tbc that could raid around my time possibly us night shifters and a few people in korea singapore and australia that the time worked perfectly for we became a pretty close guild and were able to eventually clear all man content no problem i suggest trying that and seeing if you can find people that raid at an agreeable time to you
wow,not_removed,you could always check to see if theres any east coast guilds on your connected servers if you have any connected servers are pretty much megaservers
wow,not_removed,i played in the wrong time zone for a long time as well either pay the transfer fee or fire up some new toons and get them to before legion
wow,not_removed,i had this problem when i started out my advice is pick a main that you want to raid primarily with and transfer him to a server that fits your time zone issue do research and get in a guild then as far as your others characters either keep playing them and anytime you scrounge up switch another over or just lvl new alts which sucks i know
wow,not_removed,but id like to transfer all my characters could i contact blizzard support have the server transfer apply to all my characters
wow,not_removed,per character then there are no mass transfers thats all you can do other than make east cost friends and raid with them from your server you can group with them no matter what
wow,not_removed,the reason that ranged are so in demand right now is because demon hunters are a thing
wow,not_removed,depends on what youre trying to do if you want short queue times or more demand for your skills from pugs doing mythic or other dungeons and such your best bet is still to play a healer or tank if you want to find a guild to regularly raid with ranged dps is probably a decent choice existing raid groups probably have tanks and healers both affliction locks and frost mages are in great shape at the moment
wow,not_removed,i would personally go with mage and focus on frostfire fire is still good in aoe despite the fact that some spec are just as good at aoe but clearly better in st hopefully gets off their ass does something before tos i keep thinking they will do something with our st before tos but then again this is blizzard we are talking about they keep going on and on about fires aoe but dont hold other specs to the same standard and its perfectly fine if they are great in both aspects regardless thats why im also focusing on frost artifact just in case
wow,not_removed,yep im taking as an opportunity to start catching up with my frost spec
wow,not_removed,contacting support wont do anything
wow,not_removed,possible they just got disconnected
wow,not_removed,couldve done it on purpose couldve disconnected well never know
wow,not_removed,i had the exact same experience last week tank healer combo i ready check it and everyone is ready on the pull the tank disconnects the healer zones in and out of the instance a few times then drips group too they were high level players and applied for my run together i think it was either terrible luck or a shitty troll move
wow,not_removed,might be a disconnect and the might just be assholes but contacting support will not get you anywhere blizzard has commented on this before saying that if you put your trust in the random people you find in the you are to fault if it fails basically you either find a m team or you wipe the salt from your eyes and move on
wow,not_removed,people grief other players been happening since time began
wow,not_removed,i wouldnt mind watching a youtube channel filled with people depleting random peoples keystones in clever ways
wow,not_removed,thats exactly what happened although in my case noonw zoned out
wow,not_removed,why would he have salt in his eyes surely you mean tears
wow,not_removed,salty tears
wow,not_removed,which contain salt do they not
wow,not_removed,gonna be hard to wipe only the salt away
wow,not_removed,who doesnt like a challenge p
wow,not_removed,we ve put guarm hm at hp once sad life
wow,not_removed,if you also wait until ak or before you do any mythic dungeons youll get a lot more ap same with random heroics and any kinda raids heck dont do any questsopen chestskill rares while leveling to that give you ap because youll get more once youve waited months worth of ak
wow,not_removed,itll be worth the same however everything is relative and waiting wont put you ahead just do it and dont think about it
wow,not_removed,its not wasted ap and you need more than a couple weeks for max ak
wow,not_removed,it´s mostly irrelevant because ap gains are growing exponentially
wow,not_removed,it all evens out because as you get ak youll still get lots of ap from world quests
wow,not_removed,you are incentivized to ignore the central story to the expansion if you dont do it then you lost the ap if you do you get ap not as much as at max ak but it would be more than what youd get if you dont do it at all there is no waste
wow,not_removed,no this is all your perception blizzard addressed this months ago
wow,not_removed,fyi it gives ap also the amount of ap youll be getting later on will trivialize the ap youll get if you wait its better to just do it now
wow,not_removed,that is a logical fallacy and just a bad comparison youre comparing repeatable events such as m if youre purely farming ap and things you do normally while playing quests chests rares raids were your examples with a onetime event that takes little time investment does not gate any further play and provides double the amount of ap as a mythic dungeon a lot of hardcore players are currently stockpiling these weekly suramar quests why not get a quick boost of ap later on in the time it takes to do a m dungeon or two
wow,not_removed,it gives different amounts based on your current ak
wow,not_removed,why not get a quick boost of ap later on in the time it takes to do a m dungeon or two because later on that ap is worth as much as ap is currently it will be close to the same amount of from trait as it is currently
wow,not_removed,i accidentally did this on my dh and ended up getting ap from finishing those quests tbh it didnt really put me ahead at all as i still had to get ap from elsewhere in the meantime and the quests themselves were about the same aptime value as just chaining mythic
wow,not_removed,because a lot of the time the reason those numbers arent being hit is because mechanics arent being done properly my guild has players with amazing dps but theyre somewhat hopeless when it comes to mechanics getting caught in stuns slows and even just regular damage throws players off their dps rotation and more importantly off their mindset youre that guy in the pug that leaves after one wipe and we kill the boss two pulls later because people got used to the mechanics ive heard every sentence in this post in some form ingame
wow,not_removed,i hate when people look at hps unless people are dying to normal damage on a quick fight like krosus i can go but im closer to on longer fights to conserve mana and use cooldowns at the right time got kicked from a heroic nh the other day after helping get a guild thier first tich kill no one died but my hps wasnt up to their standard like how much more alive did the group have to be to be all alive meanwhile other healers overhealed the bejesus out of the fight yes im still salty got before them though
wow,not_removed,depends on the context are you raiding with your guild or trying to critique a pug if its a pug its probably more reasonable to just bounce and try a different group if its your own guild well then you have a lot of internal issues that need worked out lol and the raidguild leaders need to step up
wow,not_removed,i did wipes on heroic rag yes the brick wall method is how it works
wow,not_removed,in my experience its because they dont want to feel inferior or incapable of doing it before my guild called it quits during en they were trying to do fights that we just couldnt do because we didnt have the numbers they would throw themselves at the same fight for hours simply because they thought that if they could just switch to the adds a bit faster they could down it but thats not how it works if youre on the adds within the second they spawn and you still cant kill them its not that youre not switching fast enough its that theres just not enough damage getting pumped out
wow,not_removed,the guilds you try dont have the same objective as you and are more casual if you cant find a guild to your liking on your server the only option is to consider finding a guild on another realm and after trying heroic transferring if you liked the experience
wow,not_removed,meh sometimes its just a mechanics thing and eventually you get that magical pull where everything clicks for enough people that you get the kill
wow,not_removed,i h guldan and botanist in a pug does that make me jesus sounds like it from your logic check your head
wow,not_removed,yep overhealing and the rest of the raids ability to avoid damage play much more into hps numbers than actual healing skill
wow,not_removed,most people who dont heal themselves do not understand how healing and hps works having low hps is a good thing if the raid is not having issues by not being topped off several healers also benefit from everyone not being topped up all the time like druids and holy priests it sucks when one healer spams the shit out of his least effective spells just to top the hps meter making all the healers playing properly look bad by comparison for people who dont understand how it works
wow,not_removed,even in wipes if people are dying from mechanics people will still complain if someone is low hps if you stand in fire no hps can save you
wow,not_removed,part of doing better dpshps is actually practicing the fight and learning how to handle mechanics quicker learning when healing cds are needed learning when to pool resources vs when to blow resources etc im guessing that most of the players in the pugs you joined didnt do the fights perfectly on their first pull they probably wiped over and over on the harder fights anyway to optimize their s your guilds are probably doing the same thing youre frustrated because you already gained the experience through pugging so its annoying to wait for your guildmates to gain that experience toobut if theyre not pugging then your guild runs are the only chance for them to gain that experience if theyre truly not improving their s as they learn the fights through repeated pulls then thats a problembut that would seem to be an extreme outlier typically raiders do learn and get better from experience if youve really run into the problem of people not improving in every guild that youve been in then youre either using some really horrible criteria to select your guilds or were not getting the full picture here if youre really running into multiple guilds where the raid leader doesnt demand that everyone flasks and eats food then youre just not looking hard enough before selecting a guild to join talk to the raid leader check out their logs etc and youll find a better fit
wow,not_removed,my guild will gladly take you
wow,not_removed,if you did it in six hours you were not even in top rankings
wow,not_removed,read the rest of his comments in this thread first
wow,not_removed,yeah if this were the case theyd have aotc from previous tiers but they dont if your goal is to get to aotc within a couple of weeks of new raids being released then why are you joining guilds that dont even have aotc from prior tiers no wonder youre the top dog on the meters it sounds like you arent even joining actual raiding guilds
wow,not_removed,so instead of creating and leading and teaching a guild you come to whine here why people are not good enough this attitude will get you far
wow,not_removed,indeee this guy is kind of a jerk
wow,not_removed,if youre capable of performing at a top guild level as you said then im sure there are aotc guilds on your server that would take you if theyre not taking you then you need to look closer at yourself than at your guildmates seriously otherwise youre going to constantly be in this purgatory of being too good for the friends family guilds that youre in now while not being good enough for more serious guilds either because of your logs or your reputation or your guildhopping history or whatever serious guilds are always looking for exceptional players because theres always attrition
wow,not_removed,and that is why you dont find a guild to your liking
wow,not_removed,sounds like you think thats good it was you that made this thread people are giving you their view and you just try to talk shit to them no wonder you end up in shit guilds a good one would probably never want anything to do with you
wow,not_removed,holy fuck you are cocky as hell please edit a wowprogress link into the post
wow,not_removed,youre telling me i should be able to get fat people into shape who dont want to change their eating habits no im telling you that if your goal is to run a marathon dont sign up for a and then wonder why everyone else isnt trying to run miles
wow,not_removed,sounds like the typical raider that wants things handed to him instead of sticking with and helping the team the best guilds are the ones that stay around the longest its ok im sure you are very popular irl
wow,not_removed,no because you are an ass about it and bring up your kill achievements in discussions where it is irrelevant
wow,not_removed,sure its good if you compare yourself against players that dont care about it its like saying that you are good at a sport because you compare yourself against someone that have never tried it you sound like a spoiled brat that doesnt get what you think you deserve
wow,not_removed,im just requesting to see your mad skills i have no interrest in your personal life
wow,not_removed,it sounds like its the exact opposite they signed up for a their guild leader expects them to run a their raid leader expects them to run a you expect them to run a marathon if the raid leader doesnt even expect people to have flasks and food then youre the one whose expectations are misaligned they have every right to complain about your whining if youre questioning why theyre not doing mile training runs when everyone else in the group understands that the goal is a
wow,not_removed,sucks to be you thinking im shit get over yourself im the one saying youre probably a good player but youve put yourself in a bad situation by playing with players who are worse than you and who have no intentions of being hardcore like you when did i say you were shit although with that attitudehey good luck in your new guild i look forward to your post in months titled my mythic guild kicked me because they didnt kiss my ass and tell me im the greatest like i wanted them to
wow,not_removed,jesus man just because youre doesnt mean youre the shit and there should be guilds dieing to have you go make a post on the forums looking for a mythic guild then find a guild from there the fact that youre bitching on here and in trade just screams youre full of yourself
wow,not_removed,nope i actually find it hilarious how good you think is
wow,not_removed,stormrage is great if you dont get queues if you are looking for the most pve raiding guilds if not sargeras dalaran might be a good option given your criteria source httpwwwwowprogresscomrealmsrankus
wow,not_removed,thanks
wow,not_removed,wow the legion are stepping up there efforts was the other driver guldan
wow,not_removed,did you piss off any hispanic women lately
wow,not_removed,im sorry that sounds really frustrating
wow,not_removed,hmm not that i can recall a few children at work maybe when i tell their parents that the game theyre trying to buy is rated r
wow,not_removed,rip op you got some brujeria on you better make amends
wow,not_removed,idk if you ever played guild wars but theres a guild wars ui on curse that im currently using and im really enjoying it i think its very well done
wow,not_removed,theres a correct answer to this question and its elvui
wow,not_removed,elvui with skullflower colors mod tidy plates doesnt look good but very functional bartender with masque quartz flyplatebuffs weak auras and tellmewhen nameplate cooldowns for pvp those are a few ui addons i love and i think are worth checking out all of them are very modular so you can customize them to your liking
wow,not_removed,elvui is a great full ui replacement with lots of customization options plus setting it up is pretty simple a lot of high end players use it as a baseline and build out from there using different addons as they need them
wow,not_removed,how is it doing i used it for a bit after they made their first post here but it was still very lacking in functionality at that time
wow,not_removed,i saw that and thought it looked good but comments lead me to believe that their ui scaling doesnt work
wow,not_removed,theres a few things about it that i dont like for example i cant find an option that allows the raid frames to be sorted by group number instead its just in whatever order it goes off of what is nice is you can turn off different parts of the addon that you dont enjoy overall i am really enjoying how the ui looks it works very well for me and it takes up the perfect amount of space for my tastes link to what is looks like on my ui
wow,not_removed,i dont particularly mind it i can see how it is an issue though theres only size settings for the uis bottom bar scaling the smallest size fits just fine me though
wow,not_removed,depends on resolution i cant see anything if i leave it on the games default scaling
wow,not_removed,nsfs not suited for sub read the rules
wow,not_removed,its not out of date its just letting you know that you need to have a character of at least level on any realm in order to create a death knight
wow,not_removed,to be fair i dont know about you guys but i keep saying dk on teamspeak whenever i think dh
wow,not_removed,lol this seems like something my coworkers would do anything to avoid checking out the message file and sending new strings for translation
wow,not_removed,on a related note does anyone know why you can only have one dh per realm
wow,not_removed,this is odd when i tried this a few weeks ago it said level demon hunter maybe a glitch or just something else
wow,not_removed,the class is dh
wow,not_removed,i cant stop calling them death hunters
wow,not_removed,to avoid have almost instant level to farm mountsgold very quickly its almost a free level boost
wow,not_removed,because you need a level character on that realm to make a death knight
wow,not_removed,yeah he selected a demon hunter that doesnt change the fact that you still need to have a level character to create a death knight
wow,not_removed,the level toon requirement for dks was removed years ago
wow,not_removed,way to be a fucking dick
wow,not_removed,that doesnt change the fact that you need a level character on that realm to make a death knight
wow,not_removed,that doesnt change the fact that you still need to have a level character to create a death knight
wow,not_removed,but he wants to make a dh
wow,not_removed,wot
wow,not_removed,that doesnt change the fact that you need a level character on that realm to make a death knight
wow,not_removed,shut the fuck up
wow,not_removed,i hate this sub sometimes
wow,not_removed,it does though because you do not need a level character on that realm to make a death knight
wow,not_removed,shut the fuck up
wow,not_removed,i love this would be great if you could upload a higher resolution version too id love to check out all the little details
wow,not_removed,glad someone else thought to capture the epicness that was the united heroes flying from one boss to another during the invasions felt almost like wow had a community again
wow,not_removed,thats some really nice art you got on your da my favorite is the blue dragon in the water blue dragon
wow,not_removed,this is wonderful nice work i loved invasions in general but i will say that the massive mount clouds going from place to place were something ill always remember i took so many screenshots of them
wow,not_removed,this needs to be a tribute statue in dalaran
wow,not_removed,wow absolutely stunning during the invasions it felt so epic with all the mounts flying place to place but you made it not only epic but absolutely beautiful it looks like very fine paper or origami or something honestly one of my favorite pieces of wow art ive seen on here
wow,not_removed,source to your da page i would love to see this colored
wow,not_removed,no moose
wow,not_removed,this is absolutely stunning and thats not truly expressing how awesome i think this is
wow,not_removed,i love that you included so many mounts its quite realistic to the actual event
wow,not_removed,no felsteel annihilator
wow,not_removed,i made it a little larger its really quite rough and it doesnt look good at too high a resolution
wow,not_removed,it felt great and i think it showed the world can feel alive with flying which used to be a common complaint
wow,not_removed,thank you
wow,not_removed,wish i took some screenshots
wow,not_removed,thank you it really was very epic and beautiful i got the idea from a thread here actually someone pointed out how pretty it was
wow,not_removed,my da is sandaradeviantartcom i kept it in black and white as i thought it would look too gaudy if fully colored
wow,not_removed,sorry i forgot
wow,not_removed,youre welcome
wow,not_removed,thank you
wow,not_removed,thanks
wow,not_removed,sorry im not big on robots
wow,not_removed,can i uhhh use this as a wallpaper its really nice and i want to stare at it more often
wow,not_removed,i agree with you colored would look like a screenshot this way looks like a memorial a monument to the prepatch invasions i like it a lot
wow,not_removed,you were the one that made the worgen warlock right
wow,not_removed,then forgetting is ok
wow,not_removed,i think that areas can feel dead because theres nothing to keep everyone in the same area or heading to the same points on the map the invasions changed that temporarily but id like to see a constant event thats similar
wow,not_removed,sure go ahead
wow,not_removed,yeah
wow,not_removed,higher maws thread
wow,not_removed,is about the limit for weeks where the affix is something inefficient
wow,not_removed,queueing for random bgs and doing ap world quests while waiting for queue pops has been pretty efficient for me i can typically knock out ap wqs between each queue pop the bgs reward ap for first win for subsequent wins and every other prestige level grants a ap token im not sure how much downtime the maw farming method has while youre waiting for a key to show up but the bgwq method has no downtime aside from riding flight paths and yields anywhere between and per hour depending on which wqs are up how much youre winning and how much honor you need for each prestige level granted its a bit more random since you may hit a losing streak but at least its more fun than doing the same dungeon overandoverandover
wow,not_removed,we have been farming dht there are way too many groups that farm mos so its hard to get the keys you want dht takes like less than minutes depending on the new random dd the keybringer porting from the end to the start and finding another key takes like minutes depending on day and time of course
wow,not_removed,mythics are the best imo past it takes too long to be worth it unless you have a super geared group and theres not much difference between and maw cos and dht are the fastest dungeons
wow,not_removed,we boosted maw keys for hours and always chested them in about mins depends on the guy gear i doubt there is a better way than that
wow,not_removed,grind dht maw cos those are the fastest ones
wow,not_removed,pvp usually gives you a huge amount of ap
wow,not_removed,okay up to what number though at what point does the grind become too difficult to spam the dungeon i am geared but i cant knock out a in minutes like i can a
wow,not_removed,there are only two affixes tyrannical and fortified which one is the inefficient
wow,not_removed,bgs and fun in the same comment never thought i would see it
wow,not_removed,this is how i do it its really fast
wow,not_removed,the downtime isnt that long for carries generally only a couple minutes in my experience
wow,not_removed,is ap is ap meaning if you can complete in under minutes which you can its more efficient
wow,not_removed,all grant the same amount hard to say whats efficient for other people but doing instead of knocks total dungeons off the farm for another less for the total grind is in the dungeon ballpark so its a good chunk less
wow,not_removed,depends on the dungeon really
wow,not_removed,tyrannical is almost always worse than fortified in terms of time edit oh wow im dumb i meant fortified is always harder than tyrannical
wow,not_removed,good luck finding always a maw key at that level and quickly enough getting maw or even keys is easy and usually takes only seconds also chance for sick gear is way higher
wow,not_removed,there was a method player that said the fastest way to grind ap is boosting mos
wow,not_removed,not if its teemingskittishfortified or teemingnecroticfortified my point was that you cant take the affixes out of context the affix always adds considerable amount of time and requires a great deal of overcompensation by the boosting group to make up for the key owner
wow,not_removed,tyrannical feels a lot easierfaster to me with the exception being high level hyrja
wow,not_removed,yeah that was roger brown fairly certain that was before tho and it might be better to drop and stick with
wow,not_removed,ive cleared hov past two weeks on na in time was pug and we chested with guild and we both past two weeks in na has tyrannical that boss is easier than hymdall if you just move after each special ability its not nearly as bad as people make it out to be
wow,not_removed,he also said because if you go only there will be moments without keys linked and to always pick the highest key aswell i think the is when theres no other keys a will be acceptable over doing nothing
wow,not_removed,uh what it was fortified last week
wow,not_removed,sorry meant the two weeks prior
wow,not_removed,would be cool if it could be something with our different elements abit sad the armor boomkin form works only under the buff
wow,not_removed,they should look like your normal human form but with stars and shit all around think priests shadowform but for moonkins that would be pretty cool
wow,not_removed,that is already a thing
wow,not_removed,maybe thats what he was hinting at
wow,not_removed,woosh
wow,not_removed,what kind of loot i mean is it old gear that you dont need toys gems crafting reagents boe bop
wow,not_removed,bop de and sell reagents boe sell on ah use httpwwwwowuctioncom to price out items run h cata raids every week until prepatch gold and vendor sell all drops if you really need gold and dont care about pets start caging them and selling on ah fast easy g
wow,not_removed,im broke dude i have gold im about as broke as it gets
wow,not_removed,im a week old on the game but i found out that you can easily make money by looking at the auction house and make an average price of the item you want to sell dont sell under the lowest price try to stick to the most used price by the people
wow,not_removed,sorry for the lack of info im referring mostly to bop gear lower ilvl than mine or for different classes
wow,not_removed,how do you have gold complete any quest at max level and youre going to get more gold than that if youre still levelling then dont stress it but at max level you can get thousands of gold just instant killing old raid bosses and selling the loot
wow,not_removed,you should always be undercutting but keep in mind a general price those items sell for and dont undercut if its below that price times like that its often useful to just buy out the cheap ones and relist at the normal price if you know they normally sell for that
wow,not_removed,unless you want to keep something for transmog purposes just vendor it
wow,not_removed,im level i spent all my gold paying the flight trainer
wow,not_removed,ah ok well yeah dont worry about gold it becomes so simple to get at max level op having is kind of broke haha
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,haha youll be right do some old raids on a couple characters and youll be rolling in the gold
wow,not_removed,im a druid my artifact levels are resto guardian feral balance if i play the spec i get what i need for it
wow,not_removed,of course they are
wow,not_removed,yes all the time
wow,not_removed,yep you lose almost nothing by levelling two artifacts fairly evenly at once
wow,not_removed,lol yea i have two weapons on points and a third on about same toon
wow,not_removed,you will fall behind by half a point or less on your main spec weapon
wow,not_removed,yep my druid has feral to resto guardian to it doesnt make a huge difference from what i can tell due to the point scaling and artifact knowledge research if i felt like dpsing as druid id probably keep my feral artifact higher but i prefer dps classes for dps
wow,not_removed,i just need some minor traits on my main weapon so im focusing on my offspecs for now
wow,not_removed,with the artifact research increases its extremely easy to keep all weapons up at about the same level whilst only being a point or two behind people who have been dumping them all into the one cant remember exact numbers but i think im at about heal dps tank
wow,not_removed,pretty much yeah bmww monk
wow,not_removed,super easy to stay up to date on off specs and well worth it if you want to use them most specs dont really need all traits to be good anyway so its a minor setback on the main spec frost blood unholy
wow,not_removed,yep im at
wow,not_removed,i think i speak for everyone when i say what
wow,not_removed,it was so much better when julia stiles said it
wow,not_removed,i hate that the quests spoon feed you the items yeah like shitty green that is worth shit
wow,not_removed,holy shit i totally forgot about the priest racial abilities good ole devouring plague was only for undead
wow,not_removed,you cant buy your way to the level cap though lol
wow,not_removed,you do
wow,not_removed,true has he ever played wow
wow,not_removed,oh and imeu
wow,not_removed,alliance silvermoon horde draenor even split magtheridon
wow,not_removed,not intrested in a german server sorry man
wow,not_removed,i love the ability but please for the love of god blizzard tone down that whistle
wow,not_removed,its been like this since they put it in the game
wow,not_removed,mute annoying wow sounds addon will allow you to stop this
wow,not_removed,good thing its not a spell that can proc and reset itself so it goes off loads right fuckingkillme
wow,not_removed,what does dire beast have to do with spawning zone dependent beasts when it already spawned zone dependent beasts when it came out did you just ask that question
wow,not_removed,this is kinda of disappointing i was looking forward to checking it out tomorrow i wonder what broke that they had to completely disable it
wow,not_removed,i was looking forward to this too we had a whole group planned with rl beers and good pub stories to tell ah well
wow,not_removed,aww i was kinda hyped for this hadnt read anything about it so i was all ready to go in blind and experience the wonder of it
wow,not_removed,was hoping to get turnt up tonight
wow,not_removed,tinfoil hat they probably dont tell us what exactly went wrong so no one will point out that this was reported during ptr multiple times
wow,not_removed,well scarabs had super fast leveling feature i wonder what now
wow,not_removed,tbh all these microholidays are bullshit
wow,not_removed,well i dont know if this was the reason or not but the mage npc at the inn you were atwhich happened to be everlook inn for me is supposed to teleport you to random taverns across the world however she only ever teleported people to everlook inn even when already inside everlook inn
wow,not_removed,lack of testing as usual real low quality control
wow,not_removed,the only thing i noticed is that the mage npc only teleported people to everlook even people who were already in everlook to my understanding the npc is supposed to send you to a random tavern each time
wow,not_removed,what did you not like about it it wasnt even out yet
wow,not_removed,rekd
wow,not_removed,how are they bullshit
wow,not_removed,not for levelling alts at least for call of the scarab
wow,not_removed,this issue didnt appear while testing lol they didnt test it lol sometimes code fucks up somewhere between testing and it being made live
wow,not_removed,not even out yet for americans
wow,not_removed,in what way are the gameplay they are novelty bullshit to keep your reeled into blizzards wallets
wow,not_removed,nope code always works perfectly unless you are incompetent like blizzard its not at all a complicated and difficult thing to get right especially when you deploy to live and have more configurations and system environments than you could ever practically test for
wow,not_removed,not really if literally no one is teleporting correctly then that would have shown up in testing
wow,not_removed,not if you test correctly code review functionally test its logic not some magic
wow,not_removed,or you know a way to enjoy the game outside of bgsarenaraiding
wow,not_removed,i doubt microholidays are particularly going to keep the majority of people subscribed just because of them theyre just inconsequential fun events that you can check out if you like or ignore them altogether and miss out in nothing player power wise surely in pretty much any case content no content of course blizzard wants to keep the player base subscribed and profit off of that its hardly like adding a few world events here and there is taking away from raid content as far as legions shown so far
wow,not_removed,theyre just silly events jesus fucking christ theyre meant to be a laugh and not taken seriously just like the bigger world events like the lunar festival you dont have to partake
wow,not_removed,if you dont like the events you have two simple options dont participate or take your wallet and fuck off bitching and complaining means absolutely nothing
wow,not_removed,clearly you havent worked on an older game i have a much smaller game and i still have nightmares on how floors kept an abstract version of their own floor tile sometimes code is made with this works this should work and nothing unusual should happen and then suddenly years later whatever happened something unusual happened
wow,not_removed,yeah my post was sarcasm im fully aware of how difficult testing is at one point was working on a maze solving pathfinding thing back in uni damn thing crashed once every or so runs dont think i ever resolved that one
wow,not_removed,sorry about that then poes law in action as for you maze was it in a memory managed language if not were you properly garbage collecting
wow,not_removed,cant remember it was years and years ago now very good chance it was just badly coded at was uni after all
wow,not_removed,cant remember it was years and years ago now very good chance it was just badly coded at was uni after all
wow,not_removed,its because you are hooking to the oceanic servers a lot frostmourne is a popular one i get this a lot in timewalking when i run it at the early hours late hours of the night
wow,not_removed,ah thank ya it definitely seems to be a slightly random thing so that does make sense
wow,not_removed,if you really dont want to risk it its probably best to just wait for an relic world quest to pop up
wow,not_removed,i got cinidaria after switching my loot spec to feral for single dungeon boss for a trinket that didnt drop luckily its a legendary that also work for balance but ill never switch off balance loot spec for the rest of the expansion or until i get all my balance legendaries
wow,not_removed,during dungeons for drops you can have your offspec loot as your choice but if youre turn in caches turn your spec to your main loot spec when opening them thats the best advice i can give you
wow,not_removed,just use masterloot with guildies who have your kind of relic in their mainspec loot pool
wow,not_removed,doesnt matter youre just going to get the ring anyway
wow,not_removed,legendaries are rare enough that i dont see the point in changing play for them
wow,not_removed,i was thinking more like relics from raids and mythic the relics in my os weapon already the chance of a bad legendary are reasonably high
wow,not_removed,yeah but what if a legendary drops in a dungeon or more likely next weeks mythic clear
wow,not_removed,the time warp one d
wow,not_removed,because they are so rare if i get one that is bad it will take weeks to get enough rng protection to reasonably get another
wow,not_removed,you could always try grouping with people that use the same type of relic so they can be swapped but other than that i dont think theres another way to get high ilvl relics risk free
wow,not_removed,are you using personal loot doing your mythic clear
wow,not_removed,is there a link that any of you know that shows what classspecs use the same type of relic
wow,not_removed,we do now personal loot give more loot per person so we just swap everything around and we are now in the farm phase during prog master loot ofc i assume we might swap to master later on just to help fill out offspecs we also use personal for heroic for the same reason we normally just smash heroic in just after reset
wow,not_removed,i dont know about any charts or anything that compare but you can use httpwwwwowheadcomartifactcalc to look at each specs artifact and which relic type they use
wow,not_removed,delete wtfcacheinterface folders
wow,not_removed,what mouse do you use
wow,not_removed,i have had the same issue randomly and have googled a lot about it i have a naga myself i have read several forums for razer mice having this issue and the only fix seems to be a restart
wow,not_removed,marksman is currently best for raids call it tie for mythic with bm being much less stressful bm best at open world survival is best at arenas and all are pretty strong for bgs in the upcoming patch no one fucking knows hunter balance is all over the place atm will likely be similar tho bm may be best for cleave fights in nighthold while mm will probably be better single target tldr bm is gonna be the easiest mm will have highest potential and survival is sitting in a corner crying for more arenas probably
wow,not_removed,sporebat
wow,not_removed,in terms of enjoyment i find survival to be the best in terms of viability in raids all spec are able to raid mythic and complete high level mythic dungeons in terms of maximum general damage marksman got the others beat in terms of simplicity of the actual rotation bm is by far the easiest in terms of highest difficulty to play survival might be the most difficult spec in the entire game in terms of pvp viability survival hunter got all other specs beat at this point though this might be subject to change in the upcoming patch
wow,not_removed,demon hunter is the best hunter
wow,not_removed,marksman is currently best for raids call it tie for mythic with bm being much less stressful sv is actually really strong for m and will be better in with the buff to caltrops and butcheryss
wow,not_removed,damn im too slow these days
wow,not_removed,so if i pick a sporebat then i will be the best at pvp and pve
wow,not_removed,truth hati as sporebat gives it charge
wow,not_removed,demon hunter is also the new huntard
wow,not_removed,get out
wow,not_removed,ikr every havoc doing subpar dps and every vengeance taking a shit ton of damage because hes just a havoc main looking for a fast queue and thinks tanking is like dpsing except things hit you
wow,not_removed,this is why i play demon hunter everyone expects me to do terribly so when i turn out to be good i seem even more amazing
wow,not_removed,look at the crews on the ships blood elfnight elf crews reduce mission time by two of them make it hours as opposed to
wow,not_removed,thanks
wow,not_removed,time to go to vegas
wow,not_removed,rng is rng
wow,not_removed,nice also f you but nice and also rng salty no legendary over here at days played
wow,not_removed,strange thing is they were from consecutive emissary caches
wow,not_removed,i had heard about the old bug drops and then you have a greater chance of getting another but i didnt have anything so didnt give it any thought i had one drop in lfr on thursday and another drop from a highmountain emissary chest on sunday plus the fox mount letter fell out of a nightfallen emissary chest on saturday welp thats all my luck used for this expansion thanks jesus
wow,not_removed,seems like it should be a bug but rng says luck can happen got my first legendary last night
wow,not_removed,some of the pieces you get can look pretty cool if youre interested in transmogrification but otherwise i wouldnt worry about it youll outlevel the gear you get from them too quickly for it to really be worth it imo
wow,not_removed,no i believe the quests your taking about are for the replica tier one head piece and its just the one or two quests
wow,not_removed,i do any lowlevel quest i encounter with a gear reward that i can learn for mogging tw dungeons are great for this too
wow,not_removed,there is a class hall champion that lets you run mount speed in ghost wolf rehgar you get him towards the end of the class hall story line
wow,not_removed,leveling up my horde shaman atm and boy does the ghostwolf feel lackluster atm
wow,not_removed,you can ghost wolf indoors as a shaman
wow,not_removed,pain in the ass though because you have to constantly keep him as your bodyguard and can never use him for follower missions
wow,not_removed,so you get a mount speed ghost wolf after about two weeks of playing that can exclusively be used in the broken isles i really dont want to just complain about it if it sounded that way then sorry it just seems very inferior to the other naturelover counterparts
wow,not_removed,its a bit slower than mount like but still awesone for questing
wow,not_removed,persistent speed boost while indoors i love it personally
wow,not_removed,you can shapeshift into cat form as a druid anywhere you want while stealthed
wow,not_removed,lol no i get it and i agree was just letting you know that it can be a bit better what i really miss is water walking auto applied when switching to ghost wolf loved that glyph
wow,not_removed,and shamans have reincarnate and lust stop complaining that different classes do different things
wow,not_removed,thats missing my point first those two are combat related second im talking about a feature ghostly speed which was previously implemented removed and then brought back into one specific zone after the entire questline for the class hall by then world quests are kind of meh
wow,not_removed,not guaranteed btw
wow,not_removed,can you roll more then once on world bosses to try and snag the hidden appearance
wow,not_removed,oh i see i guess i got lucky can you actually farm the wb for it or just week by week
wow,not_removed,nope you get once chance hopefully this isnt the only source
wow,not_removed,we are a very exclusive club is all we destros are very selective sniffs
wow,not_removed,i play destruction solely for the fact that i basically release green fire casts
wow,not_removed,basically their damage is balanced around wreak havoc that talent doubles their damage as long as targets are present which is bonkers thats why their single target will never be what afflictiondemos is
wow,not_removed,yes their damage only pulls ahead in niche cleave situations atm thankfully they are very powerful where it matters mythic elisande and guldan but its frustrating to play them in pure st or aoe fights affliction is braindead easy and is smashing the meters demo is a little bit behind affliction but actually takes effort to play
wow,not_removed,with the new flame rift it will be there was also an undocumented buff to the chaos bolt rifts
wow,not_removed,im beginning to wonder if there has ever been a classspec that isnt considered braindead just because it does more damage than whatever the fuck it is youre playing its interesting
wow,not_removed,im affliction now used my legion boost on the lock and so far the rotation seems boring destruction definitely appeals to me but ill try demo and see how it goes thanks for your input
wow,not_removed,effort thats unrewarding my de and shadowbolt keys are actually so worn out they are just blank keys from spamming it so damn much
wow,not_removed,idk flame rift is only really good on bosses as it takes like to deal all its damage the damage isnt too fantastic either tbh but well wait and see
wow,not_removed,just a heads up demo feels very clunky until you get above haste after that the rotation smooths out significantly and you get much more uptime on your demons
wow,not_removed,flame rift does about dmg for me using my stats i dont have it yet and rifts in general should not be used on something that wont live longer than thats why the timetodie addon is so handy i would prefer to play demo really its looking really strong in but we are starting the final push to kill mythic elisande and guldan so not being destro is a mistake
wow,not_removed,also the shoulders are a god send
wow,not_removed,nozdormu is alive we just killed his future evil version which was kind of alternate reality future
wow,not_removed,kalecgos was the last blue aspect hes alive and goes by the name archmage kalec now
wow,not_removed,not really that was the actual future he knew hed go crazy and create the infinite dragonflight so he enlists us to be the solution to the problem he becomes it gave me a sad
wow,not_removed,yes we know that we still killed malygos though
wow,not_removed,was kalecgos really ever aspect i know he took over after malygos but that that make him an aspect
wow,not_removed,kalec is not an aspect hes the blue dragonfligt leader which still doesnt make him an aspect and nozdormu isnt dead
wow,not_removed,it was the future
wow,not_removed,that was kairozdormu
wow,not_removed,he becomes the aspect in the legendary staff questline from cata
wow,not_removed,detailed in novel twilight of the aspects yes he did become full aspect of the blue
wow,not_removed,there was some ritual that you do during the legendary staff questline can only happen once every years or something like that and we hit the time frame conveniently enough
wow,not_removed,yeah happens in cataclysm
wow,not_removed,he became the aspect before we defeated deathwing
wow,not_removed,nozdormu is both dead and alive we killed him in the future
wow,not_removed,which is exactly what i said i dont know why i got downvoted p
wow,not_removed,oh right my bad
wow,not_removed,when the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow and the grass doth grow
wow,not_removed,well what i meant by alternate is how deathwing was dead on top of dragonblight and but in reality we killed him off in the mealstorm so i just thought the future changed
wow,not_removed,the mealstorm the mealstorm a plane of elemental pastries entres and breakfasts moving with such volatility that you can never finish eating before youre provided with another meal
wow,not_removed,made me giggle
wow,not_removed,thats a good name for a wowthemed conveyor restaurant those ones with the different colored plates that go around and you grab whatever looks good
wow,not_removed,well guldan is the acting brain of the legion invasion he personally delivered the cooperate or die choice to elisande and is directly overseeing the placement of sargeras soul into illidans body using the eye of amanthul the source of the nightwells power to do it and as far as him not playing a central role in the story leading to nh thats because it isnt directly his story but he is still a major player in it his ultimatum caused the nightfallen rebellion indirectly in the end its because the tomb has way more diversity going on boss wise than crack addict elves and demons and elisande and guldaniel make for a very satisfying climax to the raid
wow,not_removed,theres a dark horse comic that explains it very well
wow,not_removed,because sadly blizzard wont have a female final raid boss it appears
wow,not_removed,helpful thank you
wow,not_removed,httpscomicworldofwarcraftcomenusnightbornetwilightofsuramar
wow,not_removed,helya literally she was one raid ago how did you already forget about her
wow,not_removed,man blizzard is not your enemy in this fight go after a company like ubisoft and their bullshit about women being too hard to animate
wow,not_removed,has likely very little to do with it but nice strawman
wow,not_removed,helya empress shekzir sinestra
wow,not_removed,what does this have to do with anything trial of valor onyxias lair bastion of twilight and heart of fear all had female bosses as the last boss in a raid i honestly think that thinking this is a problem is sexist itself you think a final boss should be female for no other reason than being a female
wow,not_removed,nice bait
wow,not_removed,the fuck
wow,not_removed,thats a part of my lunch break sorted thank you
wow,not_removed,i could give it to my lit brotherhe wanted to play
wow,not_removed,whats your itemlevel was it a mythic was the group interrupting shit was the tank actualyl using defensives disc is actually really good for mythics if you know how to play it but if you have a poor group then yor going to have a really hard time for example ive cleared mythic with no issue but on the flip side i had to clear mythic violet hold for the attunement and i was litterally oom with in pulls because of how bad the group was
wow,not_removed,i my disc however it simply is much harder to make up for bad groups with it i always announce before hand to the dps that they should be interrupting whenever possible and avoiding damage where necessary or theyll die off the top of my head healing rotation should be something like this pre shield tank with clarity of will and pws dot mob with swp and cast a couple smites or penance if you dont expect much damage after a couple casts recast your pws on tank pretty much on cool down will atonement up if you know the dungeons you can expect where dmg will come from either cast a radiance and plea or just plea the melee a little bit after pull once damage hits the group penancesmitemindbender and lights wrath for a big chunk shadowmend everything else and use penance both has a direct heal when needed and dmgaoe heal when not dont be afraid to use cool downs on trash or preemptively to avoid big damage i believe i could heal up to as well as any others i also just finished kara with no relative issues other than group mechanics overall dont spread the hate on discs learn it and help us few rise to the top
wow,not_removed,you have to shadowmend a lot in mythics thats just how it is
wow,not_removed,your spec is close to fine im still going with mindbender even with the nerf because its one less thing to cast or think about i also prefer power infusion but thats just personal preference even in fights where twist of fate procs a lot i find the safety net of power infusion to quickly save everyone is better for me i still think clarity of will is garbage im not sure what the community thinks about this is after the patch but for me it takes too much cast time a grace shadowmend after the damage is better than wasting part of your rotation on a mediocre bubble make sure you manage your atonements really well you dont want to renew them too far before theyve worn off unless its a shadowmend which will benefit from grace anyway make sure to plea people in free moments in case they take damage keep on using that pw shield on someone whenever its up keep doing damage and switching to a shadowmend or pw shield to shadowmend if they dont have an atonement on them and you are using grace if you have a choice take a warrior or druid tank they feel easier to heal as a disc if you take a dk dont overheal them since they have their own self heals often times they will go up to full again before your shadowmend is done casting and its a wasted cast even though its dangerous because of their hp spikes i rely on the atonement healing for them much more so that i dont waste time casting something that might overheal unless they are real low make sure you pay attention to dbm boss ability meters go into a boss knowing what their big aoe abilities are save your lights wrath for this get atonement on everyone before it hits and then lights wrath and penance this will likely heal everyone back up instantly and it basically holds true for raids as well for instance when ursoc does his bear trample thing in emerald nightmare you can get lights wrath on a lot of people particularly if you take power infusion and then get huge healing spikes for most of the group but yeah a lot of hard part of disc is anticipating spikes despite what anyone will tell you in my opinion we are a little behind other healers and we do have some mana issues particularly in raids in m its not too bad to drink for a few seconds each pull i have ilvl i can do up to like mythic well thats as high as ive tried anyway i might be able to do slightly higher with a reasonable group when groups fail mechanics we have a harder time recovering it would help to find a regular group to run keys with so that you all are on the same page with doing the mechanics its a struggle dont give up if youre having fun though its not impossible theres a handful of discs that have done the highest mkeys and mythic en etc it just takes time and patience
wow,not_removed,disc is weak for content at lower gear levels usually if youre disc and want to run mythic content you roll tank disc dps to put in into perspective if you take your current gear and go holy with it youd do much better even though your stat optimization would be worse ive only seen a few disc priests in mythics and one was my cousin he said it was terrible to try to keep people alive but we managed he was ilvl though
wow,not_removed,ive never seen a disc priest in a mythic before probably for good reason their heals simply arent enough to keep the tank let alone tank dps who stand in everything alive
wow,not_removed,it just seems that disc has to try way harder than other healers currently to be competitive in pvp they seem godlike maybe thats the tradeoff i love disc and have for awhile but if its just as you describe then holy is simply superior for most pve content i guess thats what they want i will give disc more attempts in the future when my gear is a bit better but currently i think itd be easier although less fun to play holy
wow,not_removed,disc is actually one of the best healers for mans actually we have the strongest flash heal in the game and if you have a group that nows what the fuck their doing you can basially just use atonement healng all the way up to is when it gets shadowmend spammy and even then its not that difficult to keep everyone up
wow,not_removed,disc is one of the more popular healers for high level mythic
wow,not_removed,disc is fun disc is godlike in disc isnt close to the best in pve not raid boss are they not mythic are they you can still manage to heal a mythic or mythic once you get the gear and have a good group that being said youre working for it if you cant heal without your party playing perfectly where my druid heals can heal with my eyes closed in cat form then theres a definite class gap there disc can put out some damage while they heal too but if there isnt much damage going out ive seen holy pallies on boss fights before with their dps burst i can pull as a resto druid over a dungeon boss fight more on a big trash pull i posted a break down at the bottom people downvote me because i feel disc is underwhelming and needs buffs on the mythic rankings and stuff so you can see twice theyve even cleared and are usually behind at least player of every other healing spec
wow,not_removed,just rocked my priest as disc for the first time in a dungeon only heroic but hot damn it plays as a fun spec i see potential with this and plan on playing around with it more
wow,not_removed,the best im going to have to call bullshit on that one im a resto druid and i can onthemove heal triple the output ive seen any disc pull out their ass in my groups for a much longer time window shamans bring a much better utility kit to the table holy pallies have a ridiculous burst heal and never oom not to mention their insane kit which includes opbubble just because discs one ability is the best in the game for flashheals doesnt make them the best their overall output is much weaker from literally every disc ive seen in raid or content its maybe on par if theyre willing to oom themselves fast just to make sure i wasnt assuming too much i even checked warcraftlogscom disc is represented maybe of the time in the top on each raid boss in mythic difficulty as for mythic arcway first time disc makes top is and theyre black rook hold first time disc makes top is and theyre court of stars firs time disc makes top is and theyre darkheart thicket first time disc makes top is and theyre eye of azshara first time disc makes top is and theyre halls of valor first time disc makes top is and theyre maw of souls first time disc makes top is and theyre neltharions lair first time disc makes top is and theyre vault of the wardens first time disc makes top is and theyre nearly every other healing spec is on par with or better than disc in almost every situation disc is boss at in arena and low damage dps checks thats about it also note most of the discs i saw at the tops were the same handful of people probably those who truly fucking know and annihilate at their spec the average disc isnt great
wow,not_removed,til only done and yet to see one i guess its more theyre just not seen in pugs
wow,not_removed,i hear its very fun not an amazing output spec but fun
wow,not_removed,its just bullshit all the disc priest that stated that here are running with an overgeared group sure disc priest heal is good when you dont have to heal thats basically what theyre all saying at that point just grab another dps
wow,not_removed,its because most pugs suck ass and only a few of us are masochistic enough to bother with it i actually heal much much better as disc than i do as holy honestly but its a pain in the ass when you have a fucking hunter pulling groups and a pyromanic rogue and a mage that has some type of vendetta against your spec and is looknig for literally any reason to attack you for picking it and not playing as holy disc actually has the strongest flash heal in the game even stronger if specced right i can usually heal almost everyones health to full in maybe casts from our aoe is nothing to scoff at either its just it takes a lot more pre planning to get it out i can get people from to in seconds if i have the right cds up but if im not prepared for it it can get messy
wow,not_removed,knowing the fights is the keythe hard part is finding enough gcds to react to things
wow,not_removed,thank you for your submission yarfim it has been removed from rwow because we dont allow sell me on wow posts such as should i start playing or should i come back the answer youll get here is almost certainly yes however you can ask these kinds of questions in and get some more indepth answers read the full httpswwwredditcomrwowwikirules if you feel this post was removed in error please
wow,not_removed,dont really have a guild but would it be hard to find one
wow,not_removed,yeah ashran really is probably what killed the game for me all it felt like was running around aimlessly for hours just to get some gear so i can start raiding
wow,not_removed,you cannot directly trace or ping blizzard servers these should help you
wow,not_removed,its a preformed group at that point not lfd random preformed groups have a lead that can remove people vote to kick is in place of the lead meaning much of anything
wow,not_removed,yes they will
wow,not_removed,already in the patch notes
wow,not_removed,thank you
wow,not_removed,frostwyrms seem pretty cool
wow,not_removed,whatever mount you are farming and dont have yet
wow,not_removed,my favorite is actually the ruby panther all of the colored ones look cool cooler than the combo one imo
wow,not_removed,disc of the red flying cloud its probably the smallest least intrusive mount in the game
wow,not_removed,well i like the drakes to pandaria ones and my favorite has to be astral cloud serpent
wow,not_removed,fel firehawk bc its green
wow,not_removed,tbc netherdrakesashes of alar wrath rusted proto drake cata lifebinders hand maiden mop astral cloud serpenthuolon wod felsteel annihilator hands down purchased warforged nightmare
wow,not_removed,i love all the gryphons
wow,not_removed,i love the iron bound proto drake
wow,not_removed,tawny wind rider is by far the best flying mount in the entire game
wow,not_removed,headless horseman or ironbound protodrake
wow,not_removed,emerald drake d
wow,not_removed,the heavenly cloud serpents are great but the corrupted dreadwing the screaming skyterror and the spawn of galakras are all very bad ass too bad i only have the corrupted dreadwing
wow,not_removed,i like the old zulian tiger
wow,not_removed,and a decent look for the races that sit weirdly on mounts draenei for example
wow,not_removed,i like it a lot when i do screenshots and as thenargrath said for some specific races the only problem i have with it is the lack of speed sensation when you have to cross a long distance example when we had to cross half of pandaria for the dailies because there are no wings or other little animations but its still very nice
wow,not_removed,its also quiet unlike ashes of alar
wow,not_removed,i want this more than any other mount
wow,not_removed,i just make motorboat sounds with my mouth synchronized with the wisps of cloud works fine for me ok no i dont really do this but try getting that mental image out of your head
wow,not_removed,this sucks but not really something that needs to be fixed asap
wow,not_removed,its the vision of helya in northern highmountain shes fucking all sorts of things up has what seems to be a nearly unlimited aggro range once youre in combat and flags you for pvp against guards somehow when you return its both funny and irritating as hell at the same time
wow,not_removed,that and its a problem thats been around since forever
wow,not_removed,yeah i was stuck in combat pretty much everywhere in highmountain because of her and had to hearth out a couple of times just to try and reset myself its a bit frustrating but ah well
wow,not_removed,i havent seen the movie but from what i understand it is the story of warcraft more or less it happens before wow
wow,not_removed,yeah the story is from warcraft the original game if you were to play warlords of draenor on horde side however youd spend a lot of time working with a young alternativetimeline durotan if that floats your boat
wow,not_removed,heres a timeline of all the major events in wow httpwowgamepediacomtimelineunofficialallianceandhorde the part thats linked in the timeline is a rough estimate of where the movie starts
wow,not_removed,youll need to buy the first warcraft game to see the movies lore
wow,not_removed,the movie is based off warcraft storyline but the movie version is supposed to be easier for non warcraft fans to understand so they mixed a few things up i heard
wow,not_removed,either play warcraft and but that might be a bit overwhelming there are the caverns of time lets you revisit the opening of the portal tbc expansion focuses on the aftermath of the opening of the portals and wod is a alternative reality that the movie is loosely based on the movie
wow,not_removed,oh that makes sense also shows how ignorant i really was when it came to lore ill look into it
wow,not_removed,true i actually played warlords and remembered him now after you have mentioned itd if i want to go through those quests again id have to get another character up to correct
wow,not_removed,thanks ill keep it in mind
wow,not_removed,yes but isnt warlords of draenor set years in the past i didnt even know there were books this is perfect i have so much to catch up on thanks for the recommendation
wow,not_removed,so old though d
wow,not_removed,thats right you can probably start it at though have fun d
wow,not_removed,warlords is set in the past but in an alternate timeline where the legion failed to conquer draenor the movie covers the original warcraft rts where the legion did corrupt the orcs
wow,not_removed,so what is cannon for say the legion succeeding or wod also isnt outland created from the legion destroying draenor
wow,not_removed,try deleting your battlenet folder inside appdata and localappdata and restart your client
wow,not_removed,that worked thanks brother
wow,not_removed,first off hiding gear is tied to transmog now so youll need to visit the npc i dont know about the second problem works fine for me sorry
wow,not_removed,interface display status text dropdown select both for me that makes it so i can see both numeric and percentage health values no need to mouse over anything if you do it might be an addon
wow,not_removed,i managed to fix it i went to display and changed it to percentage and then it showed up then i switched back to both and its fine now
wow,not_removed,thanks for the info i never thought to check the transmog guy kind of embarrassingly simple now that i think about it
wow,not_removed,i believe there is some miscommunication on my part and i apologize for that i already have the status text for both it just isnt showing up my addons are dbm masterplan and recount ive been using these addons for a while and i havent had this issue until recently
wow,not_removed,the timewalking vendor is based on what expac we are currently timewalking right now its cata so theyre in your capitals earthshrine
wow,not_removed,if you go to sw or org and ask a guard for the portals hell mark the location on your mini map
wow,not_removed,its the guy you turn the quest into i think its over near the lake in sw
wow,not_removed,tbc one is on the upper balcony of the terrace of light in shattrath wotlk one is in the center of old dala cata one is where the cata portals are in faction capitals mop one will be on the timeless isle when releases
wow,not_removed,what did you notice
wow,not_removed,god seagulls with dragon magic
wow,not_removed,think that error denoting it as eye of azshara was a or change i bug reported it a while ago
wow,not_removed,says eye of azshara instead of neltharions lair
wow,not_removed,shouldve mentioned this when i posted the quest is saying eye of azshara the hammer of khazgoroth instead of neltharions lair
wow,not_removed,finally a healer that knows how to stay on the payload
wow,not_removed,wow needs more stuff like this
wow,not_removed,how do you do that
wow,not_removed,haha yes
wow,not_removed,im just glad his bear showed mercy to you all
wow,not_removed,im not a druid so this is just speculation but ive had a few instances where a freshlysummoned druid will be mountable for a second regardless of form presumably its a weird bug with stag form
wow,not_removed,something something zulpharrahk
wow,not_removed,something something sulthraze grind
wow,not_removed,because the most important part of legendaries is their passive effect and what might be a great passive for one spec is useless for another
wow,not_removed,rworldofpvp might have some ideas
wow,not_removed,wowhead shows and unique to that same instance so it certainly looks like it drops in mythic
wow,not_removed,i got mine from m
wow,not_removed,just farm it yourself very easy solo as bear in normal mode
wow,not_removed,awesome thank you so much
wow,not_removed,great thanks
wow,not_removed,httpsmodscursecomaddonswowhidetalkinghead
wow,not_removed,pretty sure you can hide it with moveanything as well frankly that addon is way too useful
wow,not_removed,so says the shadow of xavius stfu malf
wow,not_removed,i hate it in nels lair
wow,not_removed,one of my favorite quality of life addons leatrix plus has this option and many more
wow,not_removed,just right click it and its gone
wow,not_removed,yes there are some addons for this purpose edit down vote me for answering the question you can find them in the popular list on curse i forget what the names are i dont use theme but there are a few
wow,not_removed,im being fussy now but the ones this page link to say that if i saw it once itll not show again id like to set a different threshold of like times and then it hides the boxes that way i know i definitely wont miss out on anything
wow,not_removed,saved thank you
wow,not_removed,do you know what the ui element is named by chance would love you long time
wow,not_removed,thicket is especially bad its just so lame
wow,not_removed,so helpful
wow,not_removed,dont remember but you can do a framestack when a window pops up to get that name edit checked its caled quest talking head frame
wow,not_removed,i think youre forgetting something very important the fact that we wouldnt want the withered to end up in cocoons
wow,not_removed,im so sick of it
wow,not_removed,i answered the questionim sure everyone here is capable of using curse
wow,not_removed,awesome thank you so much
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,so says the shadow of xavius
wow,not_removed,ughim having flashbacks
wow,not_removed,i see what you did there
wow,not_removed,hahaha i just decided i wanted to get the fishing artifact and have started the grind of so this was me last night for about an hour at least aqueous shows up to liven things up for a time
wow,not_removed,would click again
wow,not_removed,you dont need fishing for the artifact you just need to be it just so happens that catching all the rare legion fish will probably get you to anyway
wow,not_removed,nice i thought i read somewhere that you had to be at to get it but looking at wowhead again it appears they have the must be requirement crossed out but youre right i probably will definitely get there i also have another side goal of getting a waterstrider as well im hoping to find a quick way to grind out those levels with the anglers
wow,not_removed,wow that dude was super intense in that video thats a pretty good method though
wow,not_removed,anglers rep dailies take no time at all it just takes a while because youre locked behind the dailies which means you can only get so much max rep in a day grinding the dailies out takes no more than half an hour a day but it will take a couple weeks of doing that every day to get the strider
wow,not_removed,what about getting nat in my garrison i havent done much in my garrison besides get the fishing shack but is that an easier method than the angler dailies
wow,not_removed,you could do it in a shorter amount of time because theres no daily wall but if your talking about pure hours invested the anglers rep will be much less of a time sink it will just take longer overall time

wow,not_removed,newly formed fury main could someone explain the rotation it seems my damage output is less than it should be
wow,not_removed,httpeubattlenetwowencharactertwistingnethernaggradadvanced benched at mythic progress qq httpwwwwowprogresscomcharactereutwistingnethernaggrad recently started streaming our raids as well as some pvp willing to help fellow warriors as much as i can
wow,not_removed,has anyone seen sims on how the new trinkets will compare when tomb comes out i have the legend heroic cof and a draught but the haste and mastery trinkets from the new raid seem like theyll be pretty good too
wow,not_removed,what is the opener with dos
wow,not_removed,could anyone take a look at my logs and tell me how i can bump up the dps even a little bit please its dannyoz i think my weakness is during the execute phase any input would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance armory is not showing my character atm due to a recent server move unfortunately
wow,not_removed,i used to parse well in since then it has been downhill could someone help look and see what exactly i am missing i know i need the helm but i shouldnt be in the
wow,not_removed,httpeubattlenetwowdecharacterfrostwolfpyavolsimple here and i have a gearing problem as you can see i am currently wearing the shoulders legs hands cloak and i have the chest and head in my inventory as legendarys i currently run the head and prydaz even though i alos have the back in my inventory now i also have several upgrades regarding a back and chest equipping these would push me up to haste otherwise but i would have to sacrifice the bonus now until i can get a significant replacement for prydaz so i can equip the legendary back i am not quite sure what i should stick with a mostly that lacks many stats compared to the alternatives or a compromise where exactly are the priorities regarding gearing
wow,not_removed,has anything changed with regard to how fire mages work i feel like something is different if only in terms of visuals example if i had heating up proc while i was casting fireball i could press pyro and as the fireball cast pyro would cast right behind it in this doesnt seem to be happening the same way i only see the pyro cast and i cant see the fireball not only that but sometimes it looks like fireball isnt even showing up in the combat log am i on crack or has someone else noticed this
wow,not_removed,how does it feel playing mage knowing that one tier arcane might be superior but all you have if frost leggys this was a setback from going mage in legion for me i want to play the class not a spec how do you guys feel
wow,not_removed,arcane mage here to help people out
wow,not_removed,i just came back to the game last played in is fire really as bad as everyone is making it out to be

wow,not_removed,are there any good references out there which discuss typical dps values at particular ilvls im at arcane and cant help but feel like im lagging what i should i generally hit mid sustained but i have no idea what if anything i should be aiming for

wow,not_removed,does anyone know how in the world i can get simcraft to sim prolonged power instead of deadly grace
wow,not_removed,ilvl ok firefrost mage httpusbattlenetwowencharactercenariustopkekssimple httpswwwwowprogresscomcharacteruscenariustopkeks im ok at mage and stuff ask me stuff
wow,not_removed,so with the new talents and the cooldown to combustion the legendary gloves with flame on is simming higher for me than the helm with af is this really worth going to seems i might get an extra combustion rotation out of it but hard to be sure depending on the fight thoughts
wow,not_removed,i strictly played fire all throughout the expansion so far and i got really lucky with my fire legos wrists belt helm neck chest with im trying to broaden my horizons between encounters by learning frost currently im at ilvl while using the neck and chest as my legendaries how important are the frost legendaries in terms of parsing well is the tw ring wrists and gloves as important as the pyro bracers are for fire i did my first raid as frost last night and on chronomatic augur and krosus i hovered around parsing a little about i know i had some mistakes but not really sure if i should be doing more also is the for frost really necessary i sim higher without it
wow,not_removed,the gist im getting is that even if you have fire bracers its probably worth switching to frost for raiding
wow,not_removed,i play my mage as fire because i like the instant casts and it just feels right to me my ilvl is atm and in m im doing fine but i hear so many people saying frost is the way to go and ive tried it got no legs for it and i just cant get the rotation should i learn frost and main they for tos as it really will be better or continue fire i dont like being down at the dps charts and always strife to be top
wow,not_removed,im a m fire mage i currently have legendaries the spec specific ones are the waist and the globes besides that i also have prydaz belovirs and shard if im trying to progress through mythic and i just want to fo the highest dps should i stay with fire or switch to frost
wow,not_removed,after the new changes what do people think about cord of infinity has it been brought closer in line with the other legendaries or is it still underperforming
wow,not_removed,got really lucky and got my frost mage gloves last night now i have for legos frost gloves both rings crappy boots chest fire bracers i know that the rings actually sim pretty close to the frost bracers when you can get good use of them im trying to decide if i should just switch loot spec back to fire and hope for helm since i still run fire in m suggestions
wow,not_removed,trying to make a decision here im a firemage with bracers and belt yeah hate me and im thinking about switching to frost as now is the best time to do so my other legendaries are shard sephurs and prydaz im probably grinding ap for the next couple of weeks so i dont think the point difference in weapons makes a difference ilvl does though i dont do that deep of progression my guild is shooting for mythic were not willing to push beyond that is it worth it to switch to frost
wow,not_removed,mm hunter question how do i correctly use my trueshot during a st encounter do i just continue my regular rotation with aimed shots or is it better to just spam arcane and marked shot like i would for an aoe fight also should i be using windburst during trueshot or try to time it so it will be on cd while im using trueshot
wow,not_removed,new to survival or interested in checking it out ask questions and get info at the and you can read up on the spec at the httpwwwicyveinscomwowsurvivalhunterpvedpsguide and the communitymade i can also any general questions people have about survival and how to play it here
wow,not_removed,how do you guys think marksmanship will get nerfed in the next hotfix
wow,not_removed,with the new bm talent that adds dmg for pets during aspect of the wild is cotw leggo wrists now pretty decent leggo i currently have prydaz pet ring and the wrists which should i run with when i get the new talent
wow,not_removed,bm hunter here to answer any questions here are going to bed so ill answer in the morning leave any relevant logs in the comment or message me directly
wow,not_removed,survival question how much haste should you stack
wow,not_removed,at what dps should a mm hunter be at with ilvl im currently at traits around dps
wow,not_removed,ilvl mm hunter w questions i feel as if my dps is very lackluster compared to other people in my raid im comfortable with my icyveins rotation but im not putting out the numbers i should be seeing httpusbattlenetwowencharacterillidancwillzsimple
wow,not_removed,as a mm hunter how are the stats supposed to look right now im crit haste mastery vers also im using entwined elemental foci and nightbloom frond as trinkets are they alright or am i better with a stat one
wow,not_removed,so what do other rogues think about the projected rogue changes id quite like to see ap gone because i have to just tunnel the boss if i want to be useful however with how absurdly it scales im worried that assa will fall a bit behind when they remove it on a side note practically m rogue ama experience in all specs
wow,not_removed,so whats the verdict with the legendary shoulders nightstalker or subterfuge
wow,not_removed,so im currently playing with relics leggy boots and cof atm vendetta and kb line up perfectly each time with this new trait for cd reduction on kb and the nerf that it can only proc every should i use kb and vendetta on cd or wait to line them up for more dmg during kb
wow,not_removed,httpeubattlenetwowencharacterravencrestsylphreenasimple im happy to answer questions or look at logs but im also here to pose a question to other raiding outlaw rogues doing mythic nighthold how do you hold up on st it has been excruciatingly hard to find anything accurate due to nature of the spec and the very low amount of logs so id just like to hear some personal accounts
wow,not_removed,rogue here again no guldan pulls this week because of elisande bug but feel free to ask encounter specific questions as well
wow,not_removed,this is more aimed towards assa rogue in dungeons so im m eq sin with bootsbracers and on most longer boss encounters i can do stable now im happy with that but i struggle to do decent dps in dungeons specifically on thrash someone told me to switch to deadly poison on thrash even on ap builds so i did and that helped a little but is there any other tricks i can do to increase my thrash dps
wow,not_removed,hello just did some h nh last night on my equipped assassination rogue was in outlaw spec for skorpyron testing it out ignore that parse here are the logs lay into me and let me know what i can do to improve
wow,not_removed,question about sub rogues and interaction with legendary shoulders does activating shadow dance also proc the effect or only if youre actively in stealth or use vanish im trying to decide on a dps alt but i want to understand the mechanic and interaction before i make a full decision i am assuming the legendary shoulders give you a very nice burst opener and turns your vanish into another offensive cool down for more burst which is why its so good when fights are easily lasting minutes at the later nh bosses
wow,not_removed,just seen that ap is going to be removed and replaced with wonder if they will buff dp to compensate but by their wording they may be tending towards a bleed spec wonder how we will fare on st after this
wow,not_removed,if anyone could look over my logs from last night and give me some insight into where im going wrong id be super grateful currently dipping toes into heroic down my stat weights are probably hugely incorrect as i came back very recently and have just been grabbing gear left right and centre as and when ive seen it realise mastery should be way higher thanks in advance youre all super pretty its flyte btw just remembered we have two rogues
wow,not_removed,with the changes to vendetta does this affect talent choicesopening rotations for sin already noticed its a lot easier to not cap out but restoring energy total is a reduction if you go with the standard talent picks also any thoughts on priorities for the new traits i went in master assassin and the two which buff ap damage but now im wondering if it would be better to prioritise the new gold trait
wow,not_removed,question for sub rogues now that they fixed anticipation is ds a better option with bladesshadow techniques and our playing with ds feels so sloppy with wasted cp
wow,not_removed,for assassination how much crit do you guys think we should have with apmp i feel like if i dont have enough my rotation suffers
wow,not_removed,enhancement shaman bit busy with patch launch for log reviews though sorry but here for any general questions postpatch author of the httpwwwicyveinscomwowenhancementshamanpvedpsguide httpswwwwowheadcomguidesclassesshamanenhancementrotation enhancement guides httpeubattlenetwowencharactersunstriderwerdupadvanced httpswwwtwittercomvonwordup httpsdiscordmeearthshrine

wow,not_removed,is elemental any good right now ive been playing enhancement for a while but im starting to slowly dislike the rotation what with rockbiter spam stormstrike lottery and maintaining fury of air ive always had a thing for elemental because its also aesthetically beautiful please never change elemental blast ❤️ but im not quite sure how it fares in open world content since is out any tips on this
wow,not_removed,as i said in my post above i just returned to the game last i played was enhance has always been my main since wotlk but from what ive been hearing i should just pack up and either reroll or respec ele is it really that bad

wow,not_removed,what are yalls thoughts on the tier bonuses for enhancement
wow,not_removed,im playing demo and im wondering what kind of rotation i should use for shorter encounters especially world quests demos normal rotation has a bit of build up and usually by the time that occurs the target is dead but it takes a while to get there and as such my dps is really bad against low hp mobs
wow,not_removed,why did they buff affliction im loving it though

wow,not_removed,do you ever want to hold off on a demonic empowerment to do dual summons outside of the opener like do dreadstalkers darkglare de or do you want to weave de between each cast or in other situations ss dreadstalkers on cd and darkglare about to come off but doom is at less than seconds on the enemy do i pop darkglare de then build back to and cast hog with the hand of doom talent or do i build to and do hog darkglare de

wow,not_removed,hey guys ive been leveling an alt currently at was wondering what you guys thought the best spec is damage wise i watched a youtube video from someone talking about set pieces and the paragon traits and he said that the order would go demo destro then afflic i checked out the warcraft log rankings and generally affliction crushes demo on i think all of the nighthold fights at least the tops spots wise ive been playing demo since roughly level and am comfortable on the rotation but was playing affliction before from what are your thoughts is affliction actually better
wow,not_removed,hi i just hit on my warlock alt last night and was wondering if aff is still the recommended spec for higher level m

wow,not_removed,shadow priest available for questions today and throughout the weekend
wow,not_removed,are wrists shoulder still bis or did it change because of the nerf to wrists this patch
wow,not_removed,anyone else having issues with voit that they didnt have before before i could spam the button so it would go off right when my gcd ended but now when i do that it casts and cancels the spell immediately
wow,not_removed,shadow priest ready to answer any questions
wow,not_removed,what would the legendary rankings be now if i had a chrono shard metronome and whispers which should i be using
wow,not_removed,i recently leveled and geared my priest and am currently sitting at with the belt and sephuzs and im having a weird issue at high haste during hero pi my ui seems to lag behind the gcd timer seems off and wont let me cast abilities also the belt seems to mess with mindblast a lot since im sometimes not able to cast it even when there is a charge avaliable these have gotten alot worse with the release of for some reason is there a fix cant be my connection im always around both home and world im sorry if this has been asked before but it gets really annoying sometimes other than that im having a blast
wow,not_removed,this patch has completely fucked up how the game plays for me has anyone else been having issues with the gcd sometimes not even triggering or going two times randomly it also feels really laggy where some spells take a solid before the actually start casting i normally start feeling issues when i start reaching the haste part of the rotation anyone found any solutions or been having the same issues ive tried messing around with the latency controls that have been getting posted but they dont seem to be helping all that much
wow,not_removed,can i get some help with what i can improve on im priestda in the logs logs

wow,not_removed,rerolled a monk recently and have been thoroughly enjoying it currently gearing up for mythic night hold and im having a lot of problems with fists of fury its hit box seems to change every time i use it a specific example would be the adds that the add on chromatic anomaly spawns on death ive stood in the same spot every time and the targets i hit range from its not consistent i play with ping which could explain it just wanted to see if it was just me having issues with it
wow,not_removed,should i keep convergence of fate or go back to entwined elemental foci
wow,not_removed,good day kind people frost dk needing some help im bad and would appreciate any advice with frost so please tear into me and let me know what im doing rightwrong etc any advice would be most appreciated im dumdeedum
wow,not_removed,so im kind of new to unholy still dpsing at all really healer main and was wondering is it actually worth it to use dark transformation in single target the reason i ask is that looking at tooltips it turns claw from doing a damage to single target into doing a cleave for lower damage does the ghoul get buffed enough to mitigate this loss in st i dont remember the exact numbers on mobile atm
wow,not_removed,hello all i was thinking about dusting off my frost dk from the oblivion i cast him due to my guild really really really needing a healer or at least a caster dps jokes on them i only play destrolock and mw monk and i found myself doing decent dps with the classic machine gun raobliteration build however my reasoning was that i dont own the legendary helm so i would not abuse the hell out of the bos build like most other dks do the question is is the helm necessary to destroy enemies and impress friends with the wonders of breathing frost or can i do the same and safely switching from a mindless rotation i have pretty much learnt to a molecular level even having only the belt and the cloak my other legendaries were legs and feet or should i keep obliterating people i mean the dps is decent even with heroic en gear and i dont really see the need for it just curious about the possibility
wow,not_removed,hey guys frost dk here just looking for some improvement advice leaving a few logs from my guild runs look for wabo also feel free too look up my on armory for stat weight and what ever might help
wow,not_removed,unholy here why do people recommend clawing shadows over castigator granted the extra range is nice but according to wowhead cs deals shadow damage while scourge strike deals physical shadow damage for a total of but castigator can burst one extra festering wound so if you also take bursting sores talent outside of aoe is dont cap rp an ironclad rule i always feel bad whenever i use anything else other than ss when scourge of worlds proc should i use death and decay for singletarget damage i dont have that legendary helm though does raise ally share a cd with any other spell i remember one time going all out and blowing all my cds but when i nee to brez someone my ra is on cooldown that was weird i for the first time yesterday guldan lfr apart from gear what else can i do to git gud
wow,not_removed,can any unholy dks chime in on the rotation and how the spec feelsperforms compared to other specs or even frost im currently deciding between a death knight or rogue as my dps alt but dont really know the rotation for unholy or if its gated by threshold like haste or something is it easy to get into and perform well with from what ive seen its a ramping spec because you need to apply dots and such edit wowhead and icy veins are very conflicting icy veins says shoulders are second bis whereas wowhead says they are the worst dps increase legendary
wow,not_removed,hey guys unholy dk here i just recently switched to necrosis as sims were showing it as a huge gain i know to use dc before any cs if possible but this leads to me constantly sitting on runes too many runes a lot of the time so my question is do i ever stop alternating dc and cs and just spam cs to avoid over capping runes or do i still just continue to alternate until i have to use fs or am out of runic for dc thanks for any help
wow,not_removed,fellow frost dk here im just looking for some help on fixing up my rotation and general things to improve my dps heres my most recent ignore trilliax lots of people died to the laser and i ended up having to help out the one tank alive im dahthknight i normally parse around percentile overall but im trying to bring it up i realise some fights ive messed up my breaths chronomaticstar but for fights like botanist id really appreciate criticism
wow,not_removed,frost dk here to help logs
wow,not_removed,mostleast survmmbm
wow,not_removed,im going to assume no no one can do that for you i doubt anyones played every spec with competence in a raid environment to be able to speak to all of their difficulty
wow,not_removed,feral druid is probably the hardest because of how tight your timing and energy management needs to be easiest are bm hunter and frost dk with the caveat that talents can have a huge effect on how hard it is to play the base class
wow,not_removed,havoc main with about wipes on elisande aswell up for any questions would love to analyze logs but that takes a ton of time so if you want any questions answered about dps etc please be exact and ask specific instead of saying can you see whats wrong with my logs takes about minutes to fully analyze your logs httpswwwwowprogresscomcharactereusilvermoonjilneas httpeubattlenetwowencharactersilvermoonjilneasadvanced would like to help with anything aswell will answer questions later today around cph time if you got logs you wanna analyze yourself i recommend trying httpwwwcheckmywowcom just remember to take it with a grain of salt it is not specific but it gives you a good idea about your logs
wow,not_removed,as havoc demonic spec is there any priority on which legendaries i should be running with right now im using raddons and kjbw but i also have achor and loramus shoes sitting in my bags
wow,not_removed,is there a good way to sim myself for mythics i looked through the options but wasnt able to come with a good solution im sure i could have easily missed it though
wow,not_removed,with the new artifact traits is there any point that eyebeam becomes part of the rotation for st since it will have a lower cost
wow,not_removed,im learning mdps after playing nothing but casters and healers for ages and im struggling to maximize my autoattacking i suspect im losing a lot of autos from moving too much and i know im sometimes losing autos from not facing directly at the boss or from just being a tiiiiny bit out of range are there any addons that will alert you when you havent autoattacked in x period of time also does anyone have any tips for learning mdps positioning
wow,not_removed,its basically a priority rotation with furious slash always being your last choice and either rampage or raging blow being your first depending on if you are enraged or not priority if you are enraged raging blow rampage rage bloodthirst furious slash priority if you are not enraged rampage rage bloodthirst raging blow furious slash your opener without the draught of souls trinket cooldowns avatar bc rampage raging blow odyns fury bloodthirst raging blow furious slash its important never to save bc for any other cooldowns unless the delay is around seconds or less dont pop avatar unless bc is within seconds preferably less just to make sure you get all of bc buffed by avatar execute phase is basically spreading out executes to gain juggernaut stacks pooling some rage so that you can fit in the maximum amount of executes into your rotation while enraged and trying not to get to rage or rage so youll be using bloodthirst execute and furious slash only bc rotation should look something like this bc bloodthirst execute execute bloodthirst execute execute bloodthirst try and pool some rage ish so that when you get enraged from using bloodthirst you can use executes in a row this will maximise your executes damage as enrage is a large buff to damage if youre getting too close to rage just use execute without worrying about enrage its still building stacks and wasting rage is a damage loss use bloodthirst on cooldown as its your only source of rage apart from auto attacks and make sure to use furious slash when bloodthirst is unavailable if you dont comfortably have enough rage for execute or you are currently pooling rage for when you are enraged and youre not in danger of losing jugg stacks the main thing is to not drop your juggernaut stacks each one is a increase to damage and the buff can be lost really easily i find staying above rage at all times to be really helpful because im never in a position where i need to rely on bloodthirst to crit in order for me to keep my juggernaut stacks if i get unlucky theres always that spare rage to keep the buff going someone please correct me if im wrong i have been before this is just how i play
wow,not_removed,i have only done fury thus xpac and would like to change it up but i seem to have a huge disparity in dps do you have a laymans explanation of how to arms
wow,not_removed,seems doubtful youll replace that draught any time soon unless its nerfed
wow,not_removed,you are using rampage below rage this is a big one you always always always want to wait for rage it is not that big of a deal if you waste some rage damage for is worth a lot more for execute phase do not drop juggernaut stacks that is the bottom line as long as you dont drop stacks and use all you rage on execute you should be fine rotate bloodthirst raging blow or furious slash between executes to keep building rage there is some debate on raging blow vs furious slash in execute phase but it doesnt make a huge difference personally i use furious slash if i am not enraged and raging blow if i am if dos comes up in execute phase do the following to not drop stacks cds bloodthirst execute dos execute bloodthirst then continue executing as normal hope this helps
wow,not_removed,i know they upped the lag tolerance to so it could be that however i dont know enough about it to be able to know for certain that thats whats up
wow,not_removed,there is a bug that causes your character not to show all spell animations for some reason so it might sometimes skip the fireball animation
wow,not_removed,because of new patch a lot of bugs going on world lagg etc etc dont worry about it
wow,not_removed,its probably to do with the lag tolerance being added download advanced interface options and play about with your lag tolerance in there imo it works best being as low as possible for fire
wow,not_removed,its a bit shitty as im trying to go from fire to frost atm but im not worried right now as frost looks very good going into tomb
wow,not_removed,fire mage here having a fire mage with bis legs and weapon at ilvl and having another mage which is frost bis legs wep and ilvl if arcane becomes the best spec in tos rip my mages going another class then
wow,not_removed,well thats easy once you get good legendaries for your current spec set your loot spec to something else s on a serious note it is possible to do all levels of content as any spec so it really doesnt matter too much it may not be the best spec but you should manage fine source arcane equipped traits
wow,not_removed,at what point does stacking haste become more dps gain than stacking mastery would you be willing to take a look at my armory and critique
wow,not_removed,some of this depends on your legos tho the only thing that makes fire ok is if you have the pyro bracrers frost is really strong and does not rely on legendaries like fire does
wow,not_removed,nah fire and arcane are still stronger in m frost is superior in raid however but unless you are progressing mythic play whichever you like
wow,not_removed,hey ive noticed something seemingly weird ive hit the crit cap at which should guarantee all of my shatter procs are crits however ive been noticing that the first hit of flurry cast off of brain freeze procs doesnt crit from my understanding this should never happen is this a bug or am i missingmisunderstanding something
wow,not_removed,for what crit are you aiming and why
wow,not_removed,would you be willing to check out my log and see if im doing something wrong except for being dead at the end i checked on checkmywow and it looked okay edit forgot to link
wow,not_removed,when running thermal void spec around how long do you want icy veins to last for this me httpusbattlenetwowencharacterzuljindiosfuegosimple edit i use infernal writ for raiding
wow,not_removed,and i would wager a lot of these mages are alts in good guilds but thats still healthy competition some key points at ilvl the percentiles across all bosses are damage to boss percentiles are adding ilvls also in normal nighthold total damage percentiles are damage to boss percentiles are so youll want to aim for a dps increase minimum adding ilvls in heroic total damage percentiles are damage to boss percentiles are so a pretty huge jump which is definitely affected by absurdly low boss kill times but still learning to perfect your burst in min fights is good practice keep in mind that all the lower ilvl parses are lacking compared to the or so parses in hc but are still decently representative the main thing is once you hit ilvl and start doing heroic the amount of skill required to parse well shoots up massively not just because of the dps increase you see but because theres simply more mechanics to juggle as well the discrepancy between bosstotal damage also shows that as an arcane mage you should really make the most of aoecentric encounters like spellblade
wow,not_removed,that sounds totally fine for you ilvl you can check logs at warcraftlogscom and compare yourself to other arcane mage in that ilvl range maybe its a good idea to start logging yourself
wow,not_removed,try to sim your char to see how much you could do and is alright
wow,not_removed,whats your opinion on extending lockouts to kill guldan
wow,not_removed,in that case i would go with gloves on a pure single target fight helm on all fights with any adds whatsoever
wow,not_removed,fire bracers do make the spec playable at high raiding difficulties however at similar artifact levels and gear frost will likely come out ahead of fire even with bracers regardless of what frost legendaries you have
wow,not_removed,play what you knowenjoy a good player playing a bad classspec will outperform a bad player playing a good class spec there is also going to be a balancing patch before the release of tos so no one can tell you what spec will be best
wow,not_removed,do you have a st fight log but anyway just by looking at the spellblades log he only got off cinderstorm cast the whole fight which is and cast of living bomb isnt helping much either if hes just spamming it on spellblade with no adds
wow,not_removed,id switch to frost its better on almost every fight and with shard and no fire bracers it is certainly better with your legendaries
wow,not_removed,i agree with toe also frost is less lego dependent but even with fire bracers and shard my frost spec was out dpsing my fire spec which had more traits
wow,not_removed,ive been playing with it a bit arcane and i like it granted i only have belovir cord and shard as my legendaries so ive been rolling belovirshard for outdoor and cordshard for dungeonsraids what ive seen so far i really like its not uncommon to get close to bonus damage when moa is on cool down from missiles only been messing with it a couple days now but this weekend ill have some more time to play with it
wow,not_removed,im a firemage with bracers i dont i blame blizzard for their horrible lack of design sense they basically made a legendary that is damn near required to play the spec when we talked about when fire mages with bracers were just dominating en their response wasnt to nerf bracers but rather nerf all fire mage st damage until we basically started throwing peanuts and get outclassed by specs that do both great aoe and great st oh and that whole shtick about fire mage is too bursty apparently flies in the face of havoc
wow,not_removed,bracers hey i just got fire leg bracers and i have a question if i have bracer proc and heating up at the same moment should i cast fireblast in the middle of the pyro cast
wow,not_removed,with shard and either prydaz or sephuz equipped youll do way more damage as frost for single target and cleave fights than you do as fire even with bracers and belt for as long as double ice lancing is a thing shard is very strong because you get seconds of double icelancing rather than this leads to very very high uptimes on iv even with lonely winter
wow,not_removed,what you want ideally do is start trueshot with almost max focus and then by the end finish with as little as you can this is best achieved by redoing your opening trueshot rotation only including wb if its off cd for example ts comes off cd arcshot to high focus then markedshotwindburst into your ts then you cram as many aimed shots in as possible as others have said icyveins has a very comprehensive guide on most situations and is well worth the read
wow,not_removed,use it on cd with max focus when you put up vulnerable wb or mt proc so you can squeeze in more ais than without ts if you know some major burst phase is coming soon save it for that
wow,not_removed,sorry if already answered in the faq i am just on the move today and curious both mok buff and mongoose fury is falling off and you have one global to refresh mok or use fury of the eagle and let mok fall off which is better another situation is mok and mongoose fury is falling off and youre at stacks one global left to refresh mok or hit with a six stack mongoose which is better after above both scenarios if you let mok fall off do you refresh dots and traps first or raptor strike a few times first thanks
wow,not_removed,wrists are either best with cof or third best when you get thunderslash try and get a cof and run wrists and prydaz imo the apex pet dmg is ok for a little bit more dmg but prydaz is a little mor survivability up to you to pick dmg or survival but yeah call cof is pretty darn good for us now
wow,not_removed,if i have stacks of df do i delay it to keep up the stacks or cast it on cooldown
wow,not_removed,would you mind having a look over i am the only hunter adthea i am new to hunter and think i geared way too fast for my knowledge of the class i am a bit sloppy in dps but would greatly appreciate any more tips of guidelines my performance for ilvl is rather low httpeubattlenetwowencharacterdefiasbrotherhoodadtheasimple
wow,not_removed,hey a bm hunter in our guild is struggling to keep thier damage up throughout raid fights i was asked to get them some log advice and was wondering if you or anyone could help us out just some general advice would be good we only have bm hunter so they really have no one to get advice from within the guild ill post the log below hopefully someone can give a glance at this and relay me some words of wisdom thanks
wow,not_removed,my hunter was sitting at pretty even stat weights around haste mastery crit vers thats taking animal instincts caltrops butchery spitting cobra i only advise taking ai if you use legendary boots it seemed like past haste started to fall off quite hard this is using sims from before we got critical damage on mongoose bite as our new trait crit may be weighed more highly now since that trait is crazy strong most of my parses on single target bosses show mongoose bite as of overall damage so crit damage on that could be pretty significant you want to get mastery to a baseline of before anything else because from eagle from flanking strike pc bonus chance to get a mongoose bite charge by casting flanking strike
wow,not_removed,you have to understand that any answer you could get would have a or dps variable you need to sum yourself to know better what are your stats leggos relics trinkets legion has made it very difficult if not impossible to just give you are number you should be doing i do know that bm and mm are close is on meters and at ilvl i do dps in heroic nh and thats not great i dont have bis relics i dont have my bis shoulder leggos my stats are great but still theres no good answer id throw my coin at dps for you but take that with a bucket of salt lol
wow,not_removed,hey so i took a quick peek at your logsarmory and have a few tips didnt get to go super in depth tho cuz im at work im a mm hunter if you wanna check my logs for comparison look up espressolite on illidan us first of all you simply dont have the legendary boots those are massive for your dps on tichondrius encounter you had trueshots whereas i get be sure to line up a trueshot with exiting of night phase also your talent choice makes it look like you arent bringing tomes to raid to swap talents around ex you want to run the meme build on skorp alluriel tichondrius botanist elisande and guldan i have the belt so i always run with trick shot over ps on cleave encounters you seem to be doing fine for not having gloves on krosustrilliax although i recommend amoc for those two bosses and augur over volley you need to understand that our specs main strength lies in cleavingkilling adds hence why we run explosivevolley on tich in order to kill bloodsetc other classes are vastly superior in terms of pure single target dps so we have to play to our strengths your dps issues seem to stem from talent choices at first glance rather than rotational errors but i didnt have the chance to go into your logs indepth let me know if you have any other questions
wow,not_removed,iirc those trinkets are pretty awful for mm to be honest cof is by far bis and a bti ursoc trinket will likely sim higher than either of the two trinkets you are currently running frond is pretty damn bad bc it procs on auto attacks our auto attack is like once every sec before haste so the odds of a proc are already quite low the elemental foci is super good for bm but im pretty sure it sims lower than a bti for mm im not super positive about the details regarding the foci as i run with cofarcano your stats are fine those numbers will go up with gear ex in at with crit haste mastery and im currently working on replacing crit gear with mastery it gets tougher to optimize the stats due to being mandatory and like of our tier pieces have pretty suboptimal stats before even factoring in other nh pieces that wftf high enough to warrant tier piece swapping
wow,not_removed,i love it i cant stand ap it doesnt work well with any of the artifact traits that enhance our aoe at least not nearly as well as deadly poison i am very interested in seeing what they have to bring to replace it however the whole high energy cost aoe ability sounds a bit odd to me sounds like it would be bag of tricks but controllable
wow,not_removed,im very concerned that mastery wont mean much in this world given that with and now im trying to stack as much mastery as possible all of this gear will be useless guess i better start saving up high ilvl leather gear regardless of stats
wow,not_removed,i like the idea of making sub choosing between less dances but more damage during dance vs more frequent dances its one of the more unique dps specs right now so i just hope they dont change too much
wow,not_removed,i read that the ass mantle opener might be changing now in any knowledge you can share about this
wow,not_removed,im interested to see what they give us in exchange it would have to be something other than a passiveapplication as what would be the point
wow,not_removed,what do you think about pairing alacdeadly with the new golden trait what do you think the cd difference of kb will be between ap and dp
wow,not_removed,it sounds to me like theyll all be getting more nerds than buffs and that bugs whatever the do with ap i dont see them choosing something equal or better and ill probably want to change their plans for rtb sound even worse so i dont imagine ill want to switch to outlaw even though the concept is my favorite and i only left it after the first destruction via nerfbat and have been waiting for a fix never played subtlety and dont know much about it but it doesnt sound like its going to be overall good changes to me tldr i might be glad ive switched my main to paladin
wow,not_removed,not a fan of the ap change i dont understand why they would possibly make a slight to moderate buff aoe at the expense of st seems like that would be a huge nerf to sin rogues biggest raid utility and make them a mediocre spec that doesnt excel at anything thus not really giving a raid leader much incentive to invite them to raids
wow,not_removed,im going with nightstalker for one big envenom in the opener got about million in burst
wow,not_removed,yea nightstalker man it does change your rotation up a little bit because you wanna make sure you have full combo points and all your bleeds up if you have the set bonus for that monster nightstalker boosted envenom out of stealthvanish i am curious if anyones run any numbers to see how much dps we lose from old subterfuge to nightstalker though i feel like its not much honestly because those envenoms hit like a truck if we lost some ehhhh im not too broken up about it there are far worse nerfs they couldve thrown at that legendary and i really missed being speedy gonzales in stealth with nightstalker
wow,not_removed,i did a bunch of testing with both and subterfuge seemed to be more stable as nightstalker relies a lot on bota procs on your vanishes also once we go into tomb and get well be using subterfuge anyway as it has a lot of synergy with the set bonus
wow,not_removed,before it was definitely subterfuge for the sec crit duration now that this is fixed and we only get secs both ways we kind of have the choice ns sims higher in single target but is bugged by from the shadows the vendetta damage trait this bug causes a tick of from the shadows to consume ns buff instead of the rupture this happens sometimes even with a vanishrupture macro subterfuge will grant more overall dps in cases where you can effectively garrote targets on most uses of vanish elisande for example it is also a very solid choice for the multisilence in fights like m krosus where you can vanish silence adds instead of just one also aluriel where you can on your own silence fire adds during also i personally find subterfuge more adapted for outdoor content
wow,not_removed,id like to hear some too i mained outlaw up until about weeks ago and now i play sin nothing against outlaw at all its a suuuuuper fun spec and i didnt even mind the rng side too much i just like managing bleeds and poisons and being able to multitask by having stuff going on a couple of targets a little more i think once people start getting it id love to hear how it plays with the new artifact traits to me it seems like they wouldnt be toooo big of changes to how it plays but ya never know until you spend some time with it
wow,not_removed,how many times is it worth to spam rtb for a decent buff
wow,not_removed,i returned game after one year and i feel like they nerfed outlawcombat rogue do you think the same thing also what rotation you use i couldnt find a good one myself
wow,not_removed,hey im a outlaw blessed with bis legies was wondering if u could check my logs and give me your input the link is my guild on mythicdidnt go in my profile for some reason
wow,not_removed,both single target and cleave have gone up since the patch though it is still too reliant on tb provided you have wrists andor shoulders until they remove tb our damage will fluctuate so much that you will probably be near the top or near the bottom of your raid dps very rarely middleofthepack in dungeons we are still godtier
wow,not_removed,hello sin rogue here currently progressing with guild on bota now i did some research but it seems really insonsistent should i multidot on mythic botanist or not ive taken sneak peek on other rogues there and some do while some dont obviously we get the energy regen from bleed dmg but is it worth to waste the cp and energy for that while i just could use it to env the main target
wow,not_removed,use deadly poison spam fan spread out ruptures and pray for poison bombs not much else you can do
wow,not_removed,shadow dance does not trigger the shoulders only stealth and vanish the reason its so amazing for sub is because of an artifact trait called flickering shadows this makes it so that you vanish seconds after using sprint if you took and dealt no damage during those seconds this essentially means that you can have vanishes every minutes
wow,not_removed,one in the vendetta trait is fine but the rest should go on getting the golden trait
wow,not_removed,switched to ds and doing fine
wow,not_removed,the anticipation bug wasnt the reason why it was good though if you tried to exploit it by always saving up for a evis instead of playing the usual rotation itd actually be a dps loss according to aethys who maintains the rogue apl for simc on paper ds was always better however with bonuses anticipation was a more attractive option for everyone except strpol as it prevented cp overflow as well as immensely smoothing out the rotation allowing you to make less mistakes thus doing more dps overall ill be sticking to anticipation probably until
wow,not_removed,mastery beats crit even when you have crit mut gives cp for the majority of your attacks
wow,not_removed,hello wordup first of all ild like to thank you for all the work youve done for the community im ilvl i have legendaries wrist ring trinket and boots i also have other trinkets eye of command arcanogolem digit and entwined elemental foci i have a couple of questions once ill have lashing flame im gonna swith to hhhsakainueottn for st fights i plan to equip entwined elemental foci and eye of command but for aoecleave fight is it still viable to keep those talents and just change the trinkets if so kiljaedens burning wish and arcanogolem look a good options right but should i remove the ring or the wrist does the bonus stays the priority with lashing flamehhhsakainueottn even if i have higher ilvl item out of set i update my pawn string from simcraft after every looty raid night maybe i havent been lucky on my loot but the last equipments that upgraded me lacked of mastery right now i fell to in mastery and go up to in crit should i keep choosing my equipment from my updated pawn string or should i prioritize loot with mastery event if it looks not like an up because of the importance of mastery for enh thanks in advance for your answers
wow,not_removed,hi wordup thanks for your contributions to the community youre awesome short question will it be worth switchin to the hhhs build with only akainus without eotn and after getting lashing flames
wow,not_removed,i should preface by saying im hella casual and just coming back after a couple months break i have an ilvl devilsaur shock collar and chrono shard but im starting to get trinkets from world quests should i just replace them with statstick trinkets or would they continue being better
wow,not_removed,for the legendary rankings here httpswwwstormearthandlavacomelementallegendaryguide does the sephuzs sim take into account proccing it and if not how high would it rank in fights where it can be procced
wow,not_removed,im seeing a lot of negativity about ele shaman but i thought they were one of the best designed ranged specs in legion watched loads of different beta and alpha videos and all i heard was praise about ele what changed are they just super weak im playing one and im loving it
wow,not_removed,hey when i sim my character all the talent builds are very close to eacht other now i wonder if the lr talent is actually worth taking for single target fights i recently switched from icefury to asc build immonly at with poor gear and while everyone seems to shit on ele i want to make the best out of it that being said do you think i should rather play a different class because nobody will pick an ele up or is it possible to be viable if you perfectthe rotation
wow,not_removed,hiya so ive finally swapped from resto to elemental because ive finally fallen out of love with healing thanks to mythic plus and other shit thats finally made me hang up healing and just go dps ive been wondering though since im mainly going to be running mythic plus on my shaman and always run lr and all the other mythic plus talents suggested by icy veins what breakpoints should i be going for for example on icy the stat priority for a mythic plus build is haste then crit if i remember correctly it doesnt have a okay so after percent haste you should then focus on percent crit etc etc so realistically what should i shoot for stat wise for a mythic plus build
wow,not_removed,once youve got the you dont spam rockbiter you have boulderfist instead stormstrike rng is a little better and you dont maintain foa because you dont have it anymore the gameplay is way smoother with the new gold trait and the wrist legendary you can come back to something close to the rotation you describe but with bigmflavalash
wow,not_removed,it depends on what you want from the game ele is probably one of the best designed casters as far as feel and dps rotation goes the soundboard used for the spells is awesome like when you hit ascendance and spout second lava burst casts you literally sound like a rumbling volcano fucking shit up but at the very top end ele is lackluster as we dont bring any utility to the raid as in why would you bring an ele when you could use say a hunter or sp who both have immunities and deal with movement better but having said that if your major goal is to enjoy the game and maybe get ahead of the curve ie no real mythic raiding goals play ele its awesome
wow,not_removed,for open world content i prefer ele to enh cl is great for aoeing a group of mobs and you get a tank pet every minutes the fact thst youre ranged means you can position yourself well and kite with earthbindls
wow,not_removed,no enh is pretty much on par with ele ele is shit st but great aoe enh is pretty decent all around except massburst aoe
wow,not_removed,its not a buff but rather a debuff on your target which is why it sucks it lasts until you switch targets or consume the stacks with lava lash
wow,not_removed,i think the biggest issue no matter what they make that bonus is we lose our bonus to equip it stabilized some of the rng in our spec which made it feel a lot better to play
wow,not_removed,demo kinda blows for doing the kill boars quests its honestly just easier to go affli and blow them up
wow,not_removed,dreadstalkers gives you more short term than hand of guldan demonic empowerment shadowboltpetattack dreadstalkers and spam demonbolt until dead if you really want to grind get demonic armor talent pull a bunch of mobs with doom and aoe them down with your felguard tanking infernal if hes up youre mostly invincible i pretty much bum rushed the entire assault on broken shore thing the more mobs you pull the faster you generate absorb shield on you and your pet before they can damage you enough
wow,not_removed,implosion gather a pile of mobs demonwrath and drop a hog or two and then implosion
wow,not_removed,rend soul got nerfed in the hotfix
wow,not_removed,what does your opener look like for krosus im having trouble keeping up on single there
wow,not_removed,according to yipz its the best combination with helm if you use effigyac
wow,not_removed,affliction really doesnt have any bad legendaries any more even boots and pants are nice stat sticks
wow,not_removed,i cant be the only one who hates demo i dont like that i have to empower every demon when they spawn they shouldnt nerf demons then give a casting ability to buff them just feels like a bad mechanic
wow,not_removed,affli helmbeltringbracer
wow,not_removed,bis legendaries for demo are ring and shoulders followed very very very very closely by shoulders and belt if you got ring use infernal on add phases
wow,not_removed,below average single target tremendous target cleave great priority burst
wow,not_removed,botanist ring is a little bit better but they are both pretty good if you dont have a leg ring you should just use both im not an expert log reader but the rotation seems good you are not wasting shards de has a high uptime you use grimoiredoomguard on cd good consumptions you could have squeezed maybe a couple more dreadstalker but on krosus is not always easy the demonwrath casts are i guess because you had to move because of mechanics so they are fine
wow,not_removed,affliction wants buttloads of mastery typically where destruction wants to hit some haste and crit first before they get more mastery
wow,not_removed,destruction favors hastebalanced mix while affliction is more about masterybalanced mix however as a headsup the current bonuses for tier make it so destruction might start favoring mastery too when the spec gets access to the bonus demo and destro like about the same stats with demo being more hastehungry
wow,not_removed,aside from the obvious normal stuff keep pets up get as many dooms out as possible with hog it depends on your talent choice and how over geared the grouo is in m if your tank is making really big pulls i recommend taking implosion but it takes a bit of practice to use it well there is a trick to getting dogs and a ss hog out then about seconds before those imps expire drop another ss hog and immediately implosion if you time it right and have enough haste you will be able to explode the current set of imps before the new set lands allowing you full uptime on imps and doing a bonus aoe burst right before the previous expire there is a good video guide on doing this but i cannot find it right now as i am at work if you ask in the warlock discord someone will have a link aside from using implosion well just know when to use demonwrath demonwrath pulls ahead at i believe targets so any time you have targets stacked you demonwrath spam shadowboltdoombolt
wow,not_removed,always keep agony rolling even if that means temporarily interrupting a drain cycle unless fight mechanics prevent you from doing so the ideal is that youre dumping enough shards at the start of each cycle that you dont end up capping out before they clear ifwhen it happens due to refreshes it depends on how many uas you already have ticking not sure of the exact cutoff thats a question for discord but ill usually dump more shards early if ive capped and theres only one ua left
wow,not_removed,no do not stop to cast ua in the middle of a drain cycle ua and reap both up yes do stop your drain cycle to apply agony never let it fall
wow,not_removed,its not that bad to resource cap sometimes you just get good rng if its happening a lot you need to be dumping more uas
wow,not_removed,trinket for raw throughput pants if youre in a fight where the extra mobility of the pants will be fully utilized ie chronomatic anomaly to get to the adds or trilliaxelisande to catch cakesballs
wow,not_removed,hey man i was comparing your krosus log against and am just blown away in the difference between our damage especially our ua damage somehow im very very far behind you can you tell me what you see i noticed your mastery is a lot higher than mine and that you ran se do you like se more in or have you always ran it appreciate any feedback
wow,not_removed,raid leader here looking to get some feedbackadvice i can pass on to my players logs here not really looking for feedback for jhcannabis as he isnt normally a raider but both flamewithin and makhania are any and all feedback is appreciated thank you
wow,not_removed,im looking for some tips to improve my play against chronomatic or really any boss but the only mythic log i have atm is chronomatic until later tonight the difference in our dps is quite high any advice you could give is much appreciated a specific questions for that fight during fast phase how many uas do you fit in before a drain what about slow i always notice my dps just tanks during slow phase i know thats supposed to happen but id like to know how to play slow phase ideally
wow,not_removed,question how much can an trinket hurt my dps currently ilvl only mastery and im not pulling as much dps as i know i should be ive got some pieces that really need to be replaced since theyve got versatility out the butt on them will replacing the trinketadding greatly increase my dps i feel like my rotation is fairly well but i could also be botching that as well httpusbattlenetwowencharactertichondriuszaxnsimple
wow,not_removed,corruption and ignore if you need to do more beyond that to help single ua and drain isnt bad for quick damage on little adds but its not great overall
wow,not_removed,for anything that doesnt live long just use agony on lashers i will uadrain just to get rid of them varies though some raid comps allow for quick burst on them ours not as much so i uadrain
wow,not_removed,agony only if you need shards otherwise use corruption but you do want to dot them w everything that does quickly to maintain buffs lashers spheres
wow,not_removed,can you give a quick break down of when we should choose different talents and why check the guide on the mmochampion forums for details but in general grasp of the time writhe for counciltype bosses you can split damage oncurrently only normalheroic botanist depends largely on talents ac pairs well with effigy or writhe while contagion pairs well with soul conduit elt can work well in dungeonslower m when youre primarily blowing everything up with sow explosions rather than your dots demonic circle love it live it use it great for cutting movement on some fights others have fringe use for m if your group really needs more cc siphon life for singletarget especially with ac sow for aoe burst damage soul harvest as jackoftrades or when other two arent viable utility demon skin and dark pact both give large amounts of shielding and give warlocks their signature tankiness skin is a great default while pact can be taken in situations where you know youll only really be hit by one big spike every minute either will make your healers love you burning rush trades all this for mobility at the cost of health worth considering for dungeons or for fights with a lot of movement supremacy all day erry day doomguard for single target he has an interrupt infernal for aoe he has an aoe stun make sure to turn off the cripple beam on doomguard and the threatgenerating abilities on the infernal generally effigy for single target so long as you can put it at a location you can always reach soul conduit for most other circumstances singularity has a niche use in fights where you need to deal aoe damage over a wide area such as for killing spellblades adds
wow,not_removed,on my affliction road i had the same issue but this was already the case back in wotlk i might be wrong but i always have the feeling that affliction is very very bad with bad gear but makes very big jumps with more gear
wow,not_removed,your talents are fine although id recommend a contagion build even if you use se either way afflictions one of those specs that doesnt really hit its stride until you hit higher ilvl it feels great once you have around mastery
wow,not_removed,for trash agony then seed of corruption depending on your stats you may have time to put agony on another target before casting another seed otherwise just spam seeds if the mobs have little hp just i and drain assuming you unlocked the trait the first add dying will proc an aoe chain for bosses agony corruption unstable affliction drain refresh agony when less than one third left in the mean time affliction drain reap souls drain when a few souls ar e available i run contagion and malefic grasp the basic rule i follow is just always have agony and at least one unstable affliction on the target note i also use a macro to cast reap souls then drain immediately
wow,not_removed,one thing to note i didnt see anywhere affliction is heavily gear dependant as well you wont start doing noticable damage until about or so
wow,not_removed,dont use absolute corruption is generally not worth taking affliction is really bad while youre undergeared your damage will get better as you get closer to mastery
wow,not_removed,demo is like the most boring spec in the game lol
wow,not_removed,aff for higher tier generally trash is the biggest time sink with higher level m and aff is the best at dealing solid aoe damage
wow,not_removed,most important question first would you trade the recent buff for the old prowl animation s
wow,not_removed,what legendarys do u recommend i got magnum sephuz kil gloves and boots what would be the best choice
wow,not_removed,hows feral in current patch can be as viable as boomkin or still behind yesyes play what you enjoy unless you are a cutting edge raider etc
wow,not_removed,is it really as bad as they say it is feral is the only spec i have really enjoyed all xpac but all i hear is sadness are they only memes
wow,not_removed,hi thank you for the faq pretty new to feral how good will the and be they read pretty good also i struggle with good aoe numbers do you have any tips for me to get better in these situations
wow,not_removed,how long would it take someone to get the hang of the priority system shittysituational question but ive always been enamoured with feral as an alt but i feel like i wouldnt be able to put in the time required with my night raid schedule i took a look through your faq and it looks mostly intuitive but seem like ferals have many many fringe situations where talent and legendry swapping would be optimal
wow,not_removed,yes basically you keep sunfire up spend ap on sssf and spam moonfire nonstop it can do a lot of dps however it will get fixed very soon so dont worry about it too much
wow,not_removed,ive got latc and was wondering about this as well do we just refresh all dots once they are stacked at
wow,not_removed,with our memekinaoe build shooting stars soul of the forest and steller drift do you still starsurge often or only when there is a single target how relevant are lunar and solar empowerments to that play style
wow,not_removed,im boomkin should i switch to mage or are there buffs for dps in the future
wow,not_removed,do i go for with leg head or head and leg that both give hastemastery and stay set
wow,not_removed,hi i just got my emerald dreamcatcher this week and have noticed i am pretty bad at using it still when i can stand still it seems that i can pull of decent numbers but when movement mechanics and aoe swaps are involved i feel like i get lost with the ed rotation and my dps suffers mostly ends up being times where i cant efficiently weave starsurges with other stuff for example star augur vs tich and spellblade do you have any suggestions of how to make the best use of ed on movementmechanic heavy fights also specifically for nighthold are there any fights that you dont use ed on i have ife ed promise of elune cinidaria and eko generally im on the obvious choice of ifeed but some fights scorp tich spellblade botanist and elisande for heroic i have been thinking of running ifepromise since i find myself mostly wanting to use starfall as an ap spender thanks for any help
wow,not_removed,how does boomy do in m what talents would you run for them i have whats supposed to be a resto druid but want to run boomy offspec since rdps is usually in need and figure its easier to get carried as a dps than a healer too
wow,not_removed,hey im new to boomkin and need advice on rotation and any general advice you can give the boots is the only legendary i currently have i just feel like i should be doing quite a bit more damage during these fights recent logs guldan wipes
wow,not_removed,its been bugged with the patch i hear its working on eu but not na
wow,not_removed,works for me just fine
wow,not_removed,i read that zealfoj single target when you hit piece tier why is that and how do you feel about bow vs divine hammer since all the buffs to its damage
wow,not_removed,there is a gear sim compare tool that was posted on the sub about weeks ago im not at home or i would link it i did a gear comparison between ideal gear without legendaries with legendaries and my current set up an ideal set up with no legs was a my set up with cloak and liadrin ring was my set up with ideal legs cloak and belt was and ideal set up with ideal legs was right now with my current gear getting a cof trinket would be a bigger upgrade than replacing liadrin with chain but chain would still be a upgrade this was tho
wow,not_removed,how do you look so good
wow,not_removed,im a bit confused about the stat priority with erratic metronome do i only need haste if i have and without it also i dont really know what trinkets to use for what situations for example on pure st ive been going with whispers in the dark and arcanocrystal and whispers in the dark and fury of the burning sky if its more of a aoe fight i also have an erratic metronome but generally dont really know when to use what trinket and in what combination
wow,not_removed,question regarding lust phases is there a point when with lust and pi both up i would want to only be filling one global between void bolts i am currently at about haste and sometimes i feel like the one global of mind flay is slowing down my void bolts i do really well on checkmywow but not sure if that counts this type of thing thanks
wow,not_removed,what are your tips on achieving high vf stacks i dont think im doing good in that area in a pullhero i usually get to if i dont have to move but the next vfs are not that good i also think my uptime is pretty low which im working on it i think that i always take too long to activate vf should i be aiming to enter vf as soon as i hit insanity in almost any situation sometimes i dot adds before entering vf or cast another mb and thats what im not sure about if youd like to see it
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,shouldersbeltbracers are all pretty much equal so i would swap bracersbelt depending on the fight
wow,not_removed,hey when it comes to our new traits should we be grbbing vtswp dmg before getting our new traits of course always getting the dmg increase first
wow,not_removed,how do you see spriests performing in
wow,not_removed,you will need to set your spell queue delay lower the patch automatically set it to for some reason dont know the specific command out of my hat now though there is a post on reddit somewhere about this exact issue with the solution its a few days old
wow,not_removed,when is the best time to pop draught of souls currently for my opener i use it when everything is on cooldown and between the end of the first sef and the second however this feels like im missing out on draught casts due to waiting seconds into the fight for the first activation i imagine popping it during sef is less than ideal though
wow,not_removed,going by rankings i did okay most fights but id like to do better it was mostly the single target fights i did worse on so could it be because i dont have the cjl chest httpeubattlenetwowencharacterdraenorjabrieladvanced though i did a few m after that raid got my weapon up from to got a new ring
wow,not_removed,for the new traits are you rushing to get all the new ones done or putting an early one into the extra fist of fury damage also aside from the chest which do you think are the bis legendaries for raw single target dmg with all the changes
wow,not_removed,theres nothing to show that the range of fof would fluctuate in anyway its hard coded to have a certain range so it really shouldnt fluctuate
wow,not_removed,definitely dont get rid of it if youre using serenity at all because you have the chest or dhc then convergence can be very useful
wow,not_removed,i believe you should be using dt on cooldown without regard to whether it is aoe or st it should be a dps increase in both situations unless your pet is unable to be on target for whatever reason under dt claw transforms into sweeping claws which is a shadowbased cleave while sweeping claws is of normal damage to the main target and targets nearby the damage is calculated as shadow which allows it to bypass armor this should be an increase in st damage as sweeping claws damage will not be reduced by armor additionally gnaw becomes monstrous blow which deals of normal damage against the target compared to gnaws light damage
wow,not_removed,i dont have legendary helm wrist ring and belt i only use prydaz and kiljaedens and bursting at damage stable at dps after bos so yes you dont need the helm well actually you still need it however you can perform atleast above average without those four bis equips change all your relic to blast radius and youll atleast gain an almost equal footing with those dks that have the helm and get that bonus on lfrnormalheroic nh it helps gain more rp during bos and triggers rime quite frequently
wow,not_removed,hi friend frosty here just wanting to chime in at the moment i have two builds my first build is for clearing mythic trash and it uses the legendary pants we get which lowers sindra fury by and my second is the bis ring we get with charges of empower rune weapon my second build is the ring with the belt and thats for single target to answer your question about the helmet since the nerf occurred it is currently the best cleave item and tied for with the bracers and belt the bis legendary we can have is the ring i was mentioning i dont have the helm and in single target fights i can burst for and i can maintain swap all relics to blast radius i recommend farming brh il gynoth and gul danmephistos from new dungeon as this will give you a buff to hb once you get your relics you should be able to compete with a lot of people in terms of dps you should aim for crit haste then mastery im currently attempting to experiment with mastery over haste to get my hbs to crit higher but its a slow process crit is the main stat we want trinkets you should go for horn of valor and convergence of fates however if you cant get these some great secondaries are memento entwined hunger of the pack this one is great for getting your crit up as it usually runs a base crit of eye of command ettin fingernail and a few others if you have any questions lmk
wow,not_removed,clawing shadows is buffed by mastery and if you have higher than mastery then its better to use cs over castigator on the other hand castigatorscourge strike also benefits on versatility it all depends on what secondary stat you prioritize mastery or versatility shadow damage or physical damage festering wounds death coil and virulent plague also benefit from mastery out damaging your physical damage dealers festering strike scourge strike and death strike if you have high mastery try getting equipments with mastery and buff up your mastery to youll notice a big gap between castigator and clawing shadows you will definitely cap rp its not that bad capping it however your missing your chance to proc runic corruption as that is one of your rune generating passives the more rp you spend the more chance runic corruption procs the more rune you can spend death march legendary helm is crap even if it was buffed on patch you can use dnd on single target whenever you prefer i only use it on multiple targets though but thats just me theres only a number of bres usable in a one fight
wow,not_removed,mostly because clawing shadows is entirely shadow damage so the entire attack gets buffed by mastery rather than just the that scourge strike does for the and im not entirely sure so im gonna stick around and hope someone else answers as for number theres a finite number of battle rezzes a party can use in a given fight
wow,not_removed,uh rotation single target burst window dtdark transformation aotmarmy of the dead srsoul reaper aotmoutbreakdtfsfssrapocfsdccsdccsdccs single target post burst window fsfestering strike dcdeath coil csclawing shadows fsfsdccsdccsdccs rinse and repeat insert outbreakvirulent plague everytime before it reaches zero uh is actually pretty right now imo haste is okay with mastery and maybe crit and yes its really easy to get hook into
wow,not_removed,use dc as a rp dumper and when you dont overcap the wounds if you have spam cs to not overcap runes
wow,not_removed,i have a question about the bos build i just started playing again after not playing since november after and now that bos seems to be the build to go with and no longer the obliterationra build what should my opener look like with the bos build also i have the legendary bracers are they still useful in with a bos build although i only have legendary at this point i was just curious for future reference i know the helm as always been desirable but i did see we have some changes to how some of our legendaries worked
wow,not_removed,i have mo args bracers for the increase in dmg on throw glaive is it overall worth it to take bloodlet now for st fights and if not which fights are worth getting bloodlet in over fb
wow,not_removed,are you also going with the bloodlet build now for raiding
wow,not_removed,hello httpswwwwowprogresscomcharactereuburninglegionvardenir httpeubattlenetwowencharacterburninglegionvardenirsimple what legendaries and trinkets should i use now dont have moarg or kiljaeden only symbiote sephuz or loramus on single target with aohg i use now but maybe there is some better builds for raids should i use loramus insted of anger ring on m with demonic build
wow,not_removed,piggybacking off some of the other questions and just trying to get a better understanding i have ring shoulders bracers and kjbw i also have cof so ive been running a demon blades chaos blades build with shoulders and ring but reading through the comments it seems that until the trait bloodletting and bracers are making a comeback instead of ring and first blood but what about shoulders cof and ring plus bloodlet or bracers but keeping demon blades i know the easiest thing is to sim but i want a spec that i dont have to change in the middle of nh
wow,not_removed,with the new artifact traits is there any point that eyebeam becomes part of the rotation for st since it will have a lower cost
wow,not_removed,there are now several really nice demonic builds you can use bloodlet as well if you have the bracers or a momentum build with boots you focus on max cleave anyways and felrush just aligns great with eyebeam on large packs and buffing the deathsweep and annihilation spam followed in meta kjbw is also a great choice demonic right now alwys assuming raddons is equipped with two buffed legendarys bracers boots can play in quite some different specs
wow,not_removed,i would choose a template like hectic add cleave thats what you have mostly in m what are your available legendarys right now
wow,not_removed,yes with at least traits in the cost reduction it should get added to st rotation unless you are in meta or there will be adds coming out in the next seconds
wow,not_removed,can you feel when your abilities arent going off thats usually how i can tell if im out of range i think you can probably set up something with weakauras that would help with this issue i wouldnt approach it as needing a reminder to attack you just need to know when youre in range as long as youre able to use your melee range abilities your auto attack should start swinging as soon as you start your rotation something like a crossedout sword that shows up in combat over your charcters head when youre not in melee range for pure dps the thing you want to be asking yourself are is there a mechanic thats going to kill me am i standing in something bad am i healthy if heals are needed can i get in range and stay on the boss am i behind the boss try to think of things that would minimize how much dps you lose like dying and maximize how much you gain like staying behind the boss in range of heals for as long as possible if you want to learn about higher level melee positioning i actually recommend preach gaming youtubes tanking videos anything skills you develop as a tank have some carryover to the dps role including personal survivability group utility ccdisruption capitalizing on group play and mitigating mistakes etc you dont need to actually tank but being aware of how much there is for you to do as melee dps is the first step in you using your mobility to get somewhere and make the right decision on what it is you should be doing in addition to just your rotation good dps carries dungeons but you can multiply your contributions if you add in all the other stuff too
wow,not_removed,woaw didint expect a quick answer thank you
wow,not_removed,u forgot rampage in your opener rotation its cdsavatarbc rampagerbodyns fury or bt
wow,not_removed,for execute phase i go enraged bloodthirst execute enrage bloodthirst execute rb fs is this rotarion super wrong then
wow,not_removed,great inputs thanks but could you expand on the uptime of the juggernaut buff the icyveins guide doesn´t mention this as far as i know and i haven´t gotten very familiar with it so by not going beneath rage you can more frequently avoid losing the sec buff
wow,not_removed,youre mostly on point but if youre getting too close to rage just use execute without worrying about enrage is wrong when youre using frothing berserker which you always should
wow,not_removed,hi there mate my answer will depend on how serious you play the game if youre high end always minmax person you might want to leverage your efforts on fury and youll have some nice dps outputs at least for now in nighthold if youre a casual player just chilling and enjoying the game both specs are cool enough to have fun honestly i am some sort of minmax player but due to the amazing ap grind system s i cant play fury atm i maxed my arms and i dont have time to change it and grind endless for fury from zero answer to your main question we can roughly generalize arms as good single target damage dealer spec and fury for good aoe damage dealer spec even though arms has great aoe burst with warbreakerbladestorm you wont be able to pull out sustained aoe symmetrically inverse story is valid for fury single target youll pop everything and hit dos trinket opening up amazingly on single target but in the end arms would surpass fury in the long run when it comes down to single target if you are having huge dps disparity the reasons might vary in quite long list correct legendary items traits low mastery rotational mistakes etc in general we have quite some multiple targets in nighthold it is quite safe to say this is the main reason fury appears higher than arms on the charts i hope it makes sense let me know if you want to know anything further
wow,not_removed,this might be it ive changed it back to the original and casting felt more smooth
wow,not_removed,whats the advantage of having it lower
wow,not_removed,you would have to sim your character to see exactly what your stat weights are but once i got kilt the value of mastery dropped low the main appeal of mastery is the extra mana pool and mana regen rate so having legendaries that increase your mana regen will reduce the strength of mastery
wow,not_removed,scorch belt as well
wow,not_removed,true fire is totaly fine for heroic content but if you want to do the highest dps possible you should go frost
wow,not_removed,the target isnt frozen for the first hit it gets frozen by the hit
wow,not_removed,for frost at least for fire
wow,not_removed,if you want you can go ahead and link and ill try my best but if it all looks good not sure how much youll get out of it best to link a star augurkrosus log where you didnt die to get the best help with rotation and the like
wow,not_removed,it depends on talents legendaries and rng no gloves lonely winter and splitting ice my setup all reduce icy veins up time id say around seconds with that setup if you can reach frozen orb youre doing well
wow,not_removed,try to get something else besides infernal writ even a stat stick might be better with the way frost works you dont want to have a trinket with variable crit
wow,not_removed,im not him but typically the only reason a lockout should be extended is if the wipes are getting to a point where more gear doesnt make a difference such as sub wipes that just need that one mistake to go away otherwise the gear gained from a mythic clear is invaluable in the end it is up to the judgement of the raid leaderofficers of the guild
wow,not_removed,hey i just got fire leg bracers and i have a question if i have bracer proc and heating up at the same moment should i cast fireblast in the middle of the pyro cast
wow,not_removed,its not a bad thing because you basically increase the damage of that pyro and the other pyro youre firing off after you hardcast it its what i do
wow,not_removed,even for the meme build which i assume op is using on the iv guide the opener is wbtspsesarcsmsnormal rotation and in the normal rotation section procced arcs and ms are both above ais in priority
wow,not_removed,mok over all and if mok falls off start your rotation again as if you just pulled
wow,not_removed,use them right away while still prioritizing kill command it might cap you but theres nothing you can do about that the shoulders kinda screw with the rotation in that way we all have drilled into our heads that capping capital sin but the cd reduction on its own is insane if youre on one charge you could delay it a little but you do want to keep the stacks up especially during aotw with the new thunderlash trait
wow,not_removed,the biggest thing im seeing is your cooldown management you need to be using aspect of the wild as often as possible especially with the new thunderlash trait but it needs to be lined up with bw i cant find your armory but if you have access to a convergeance trinket id get that it helps a ton in giving you the options you shouldnt have to delay it for more than a few seconds speaking of trinkets ditch that aoe trinket you have its really not good unless youre on heavy aoe fights and even there with thunderlash being aoe convergeance could be better still you should be running bti convergeance unless you have a really really good stat stick foci or kjs burning wish which i dont see you using secondly dont wait for bw to use titans thunder unless its its only seconds away from being up use it right off cooldown try to use it before a df and not right after one to get the bonus damage to df its pretty significant when mine crits it hits for almost million split in the hits it causes thirdly make sure you enter bestial wrath with focus or more i know its tough but see it like this try to keep focus at until bestial wrath dont empty it and hope for a reload of focus when the time is right so use cobra shot only to keep it under cap not the other way around try to hover near max focus i know its tough with dire frenzy especially when you get procs but in that case just go hard and dump then use your charges if you can stay around youll feel incredibly powerful when you need to burst swap for instance on krosus i hover near max and when the embers spawn i can swap to them with full cds and with the charge to df kc i can literally take care of the embers by myself in a raid on heroic because my pet is everywhere the only cd you need to burst ondemand is bw so look at your timers and see if it lines up another example on spellblade it could be worth it to delay bw aotw secs and stay near max focus only using kccobra to dump in order to use it on the adds in fire phase this is how players get dps on that fight lastly make sure you always pot twice ideally that second pot should come when hero comes up if it wasnt on pull or when you have heavy aoe damage if none of the above are true use when you have all your cds lined up good luck rest looks good
wow,not_removed,thats not how things work flanking strike is edit i might be going insane i have to test something about the rest of my comment
wow,not_removed,honestly i thought the meme build was some troll thing that wasnt really that viable i thought volley was the best option out of the for what you getspend for all fights we have another hunter in guild with boots who gets more aimed shots but i want to attribute that to the boots but our dps difference is somewhat a big gap so im not sure
wow,not_removed,i dont think anyone loves ap but i fear assa might suddenly be the worse scaling one and then its gg bis assa legendaries
wow,not_removed,i understand where theyre coming from with sub currently if i can cleave a bit im pretty much either in shadow dance or im pooling for a shadow dance with a bit of cleave i basically ignore backstab entirely which feels strange for such an iconic rogue ability the one thing id like aswell is for symbols to just go away it really doesnt add much rotational depth since all you do is pray for es proccs during a dance when you need to refresh it and maybe save up cp beforehand but thats minor ill be a bit sad when they remove nightblade though i always like having a dot
wow,not_removed,nightstalker is back and you want to vanish envenom now if you have
wow,not_removed,well they mentioned some kind of poison aoe i would imagine a crimson tempest meets poison bomb it seems like exsanguinate will be goto single target and then well have some form of aoe aswell
wow,not_removed,well currently ap is just too strong to consider anything else for single target and it seems like in the next patch well automatically get dp x iirc with ap youll have an average cd on kingsbane of around seconds with dp alacrity i dont really know but i would estimate maybe sec
wow,not_removed,this is my worry aswell on the other hand if they manage to tune the other correctly so that we dont lose dps this is a massive if then assassination will just become better all around and to be honest i wouldnt mind too much respeccing to sub for single target if its needed i just need to get lucky again with legendaries
wow,not_removed,i just dont understand the bleed or poison philosophy that blizz has bleeds scale horribly only critvers and poison only scales well currently because of ap if they remove ap then they have to overtune our other abilities to make up for it and then by the end of each tier we will be trash because everyone else scales well with gear i agree that ap is boring but it is literally the only thing that makes us viable dps at the moment
wow,not_removed,basically what they did to feral and made utterly garbage and useless lowered its st for more consistent aoe
wow,not_removed,in comparison to most other classesspecs there are close to none i also say this because at times i do a and i still only get in my bracket due to the monstrous numbers that outlaw can pull out with extreme luck during a fight just makes it hard to gauge and reach a conclusion every time i run in to another outlaw player they are usually horrible and i cant use that as reference just wanted some people to pitch in with their own experience
wow,not_removed,cant really put a number on that im afraid p its really contextually heavy and it will vary from situation to situation besides decent right now is almost only tbanything else pretty much just leading us to all buffs are bad and tb is king obviously this isnt the whole truth but it will be correct in of all cases in the last youre waiting for cds both synced seconds left in which case you do want to roll for a that will do damage over the next seconds in which case any is good enough for that purpose as far as rolling for buffs at the start of an encounter just dont hold your cds any longer than seconds maybe a bit more if you know youre not going to lose a cd usage off of it
wow,not_removed,nerfed in comparison to what combat is mostly the same it has always been bar the heavy rng element high apm shines on aoe there are decent enough outlaw guides out there to help with rotations though no specs really follow a rotation anymore but rather a priority system httpwwwicyveinscomwowoutlawroguepvedpsrotationcooldownsabilities the above guide is mostly correct but just needs a update such as ghostly strikes now working with cotd so no need to refresh it before you go into cds
wow,not_removed,seems to me that the main kicker for you on fights where you perform below your expected output is that you dont fish for tb enough trilliaxm only uptime on tb star augurh which is alright but you want to look at higher uptime obviously dream scenario but over the weeks it should be very possible to find a log higher than without any particular luck tichoh uptime you see the pattern with your legendaries tb becomes absurd no reason to even consider the other buffs unless you dont need the cd reset at all like if the boss is below and tb wont give you another ar or you have cds up and better off with siw and so on and so forth
wow,not_removed,rogue here we several kills on botanist honestly i dont think its worth it you should play ap and at that point you are losing too much dps trying to keep poison and bleeds on targets since ap is so hard to apply with fan so st is the way to go
wow,not_removed,on mythic i do not there isnt any value in doing so since the damage gets wasted babysitting ruptures means you are missing out on envenoms for potential damage to the main target at hand
wow,not_removed,thanks for this ill take some of it on board when you say im not using the cds properlyon time what do you mean should i be aiming to have them both go off at the same time should i just be rolling them as and when they become available again i felt like i was on top of the cds but clearly not for finishers there were a couple of times i was reapplying rupture at cp because it was due to fall off and i would have had gcds before reapplying a one so i was reapplying with only cps to keep it rolling till i could get in another full refresh is that correct alongside this i feel like i was definitely hitting cp envenoms to try and keep surge of toxins rolling without any downtime should i just let this drop off in favour of a envenom instead even if it means sot dropping off intermittently my bleed time absolutely has suffered i can see that thanks for your insight
wow,not_removed,with set how do you deal with cp overcap during shadow blades
wow,not_removed,sim new pieces of gear rather than only relying on the stat weights i have a ring that says its a upgrade with my weights but when i equip it i actually lose dps my crit is also crazy high at with my mastery at only but most of the crit is from sephuz prydaz and the set pieces which i cant really change i still sim single target at ilvl so i guess its pretty decent anyway
wow,not_removed,for st generally if theres no switching eye foci will be fine in cleaveaoe i wouldnt really recommend playing a hhbracers oriented build hailstorm and hhbracers are very single target focused and will reduce your aoe id switch bracers out and go for a bf build with kjbw instead of them yes you still want to maintain the seems low but if you trust the weights you should trust the results on what its telling you is an upgrade if something is wrong the weights would shift back and you could reevaluate
wow,not_removed,after lashing flames the bracers is enough to support hot hand ring just accentuates it
wow,not_removed,id switch out to stat sticks just for the reliability at that ilvl theyre going to be pretty unimpressive procs that low
wow,not_removed,those sims are without proccing it iirc rating the procc is hard as it comes down to the timing most of the time it comes with adds so its pretty decent and should be considered an aoe leggie
wow,not_removed,why is lr pulling about the same as ascendance st
wow,not_removed,the big problem is that our design basically makes our niche be denying other people aoe and praying for lr in a raid like nighthold that makes us appear to perform well because there is a good number of fights which support that playstyle on the flip side however it also means blizzard takes the opportunity to use that as an excuse to keep us more towards the lower end in other situations we are not good for low target cleave spread or stacked we are belowaverage st and we have a lot of trouble dealing with mechanics we are a low mobility spec and we have very little raid utility you can particularly see this if you look at our performance on elisande and guldan fights that play into our weaknesses also i never really understood the praise we got in alphabeta the spec has barely changed in the past expansions except slightly on the aoe front we went from spam cl to big eq dmg to some of both stormkeeper i guess maybe legion got people trying a lot of other specs and people enjoyed ele despite it being a bit of an old playstyle note i love ele and have for many years now i was just more confused what made people suddenly start praising it with almost no change
wow,not_removed,they are one of the worst specs dealing with movement and nh has a lot of heavy movement elisande and guldan especially requires so much movement so our dps falls off a cliff
wow,not_removed,all of our talents are equally usable single target if will become further and further our worst as we get more traits in particular the maelstrom increase trait benefits if very little you will see most people running asc st and lr whenever there is even a little aoe that doesnt mean thats the only option but it is definitely the easiest to pull off and usually lines up well with boss timings
wow,not_removed,lr is really strong actually best for patchwork style but only with the tier bonus stormearthandlava the main resource for ele shamans has a post about it httpswwwstormearthandlavacomelementalshamanhub edit lol didnt even answer the question eles are viable for everyday progression sure people will want the fotm classes but people will pick up a good ele
wow,not_removed,yes the one week where i didnt have and had to play foa almost made me kill myself
wow,not_removed,thanks for the advice just a question though why does your rotation suddenly change at the bonus just states that lava lash has a chance to proc stormbringer am i missing something
wow,not_removed,i didnt understand that lava lash consumed it does it mean that we should wait for the hot hand proc to cast lava lash to maximize the effect that would clearly impact the rotation
wow,not_removed,hopefully they recognize that and fix it its insane that too be a stable class for your raid groups and to have a smooth flowing rotation that you need to have a tier set
wow,not_removed,ive been spending some more time with my affliction alt mage main and good gods youre not kidding im pretty sure leash distance was the only thing stopping me from completing every quest at once by just dotting everything running the entire island and popping two rounds of seeds
wow,not_removed,except its still way ahead and nobody has rend soul yet it was a nerf to keep affliction from burying everyone when we get to traits instead of just being ahead like now
wow,not_removed,prepull double elt as close to as possible and pot before combat starts cast infernal immolate service imp immolate soul harvest dimensional rift especially if space time shoulders conflag conflag conflag chaos bolt chaos bolt conflagbolt until out of shards
wow,not_removed,and boots will be very competitive with when you cannot cancel your drain soul for the haste buff
wow,not_removed,it just blows my mind that demo went from turning into a big ass demon to summoning a couple imps and dogs if you want me to believe im supposed to be the master of summoning demons why can i only summon a handful of the shittiest demons
wow,not_removed,that changed with the nerf to our golden cape is up there again
wow,not_removed,hmm yipz reported he is simming higher with the pants
wow,not_removed,so looking through the logs there are a few things that come to mind your number of uas cast was rather low you had casts to of mine i think that you were also too hesitant to have multiple uas past on the target at once for instance my ua had uptime whereas your fourth ua had now granted some of this is luck based i had better than average fatal echoes procs i had approximately fatal echoes procs whereas it looks like you had around fatal echoes procs some other things i noticed you arent tagging the lowest health emeber in a group only with corr or agony and having soul flame give do the rest for woc stacks you were only hitting woc stacks every time compared to my now some of this is due to rng but once adds come up your priority outside of agony is to tag them for woc stacks furthermore once you have those woc stacks its beneficial to cast uas as while you will lose tick of the first ua fitting in another ua into woc window is better than being efficient with uadrain uptime as the damage buff on another uas outweighs losing ticks of uas its fine if youre shard starved for a bit after that your biggest burn phase is done also it looks like you are casting corruption before siphon life corruption is higher dpct than sl yeah but the higher duration of sl means that to smooth your rotation you should be casting agony sl corr when you refresh dotsthat combined with looking hesitant to continue draining uas and letting slcorr drop is hindering your output if you can do it in under second btw it is beneficial to snipe adds with drain soul for shards but only if you know the add is immediately about to die and you can get the shard before the global finishes lastly yes ive always taken se over sc on krosus you can hit the se from the last platform if you cast it at max range initially it also performs better than sc in every possible patchwerk situation and is doubly beneficial on krosus as it gives you more mobility over sc assuming you are in range of the se as you have another instant cast spell to be using while moving and something to cast on while you are out waiting to soak puddles edit going through the cast log timelines as well it looks like you are refreshing dots when you dont have to semifrequently it looks like it happened or times throughout the fight the only time that should ever be the case is if you are about to go soak puddles your ordering of debuffs also doesnt help and your dot timings dont line up because of it lastly cast reap after your ua whether you are going to drain or not unless you have only soul as you want that reap to be up for the first tick of your first ua which should happen right after you finish casting your ua
wow,not_removed,im going to take a moment to laugh at how many whispers procs flame got on krosus procs in minutes is absolutely insane ive never gotten more than alright that out of the way lets examine a few things first off makhania is just not casting abilities at times just as an example there was a second window on your augur kill where he literally wasnt casting anything except life tap im not sure of a single mechanic of heroic star augur that would make that happen that shouldnt even happen in mythic at absolute minimum he needs to be aware of where he needs to be beforehand if you are making a decision as a mechanic comes out youre making it too late and you are making it wrong doesnt matter if you stumble into the correct choice you making the decision as the mechanic comes out instead of knowing what to do beforehand is simply poor play there are some really basic mistakes being made here that show a real lack of understanding of the game i think that both players would benefit greatly from just sitting in the class discord and reading stuff for a few hours because there are enough mistakes here that im not going to break them down one by one mostly i think that both of your players could benefit from the following actually look up the fights and understand the flow if it there seems to be no cooldown pooling no preemptive portalsgateways rarely tapping adds to get woc flames case too much movement at all in makhanias case etc demo is heavily penalized for movement so you have to do your best to minimize it while still doing mechanics there are many rotational mistakes on both of their ends but more on makhania bear in mind demo is more mechanically demanding however either way reading the guides in the resources tab of the warlock discord the link to that is in my parent comment should be helpful as well as asking questions for any specific concerns that they have
wow,not_removed,your rotation looks more or less alright and good job having the presence of mind to seed the boss instead of using globals dotting the adds however you should only ever be seeding once it looks like you cast it twice at which point its literally better to just dot them individually that being said there were times where you werent dumping as many uas as you couldshould have for instance your second whispers proc lined up with woc from the adds as soon as you seeded the boss and refreshed agonycorr you should have been dumping uas and getting at least drain cycle in ideally starting a new one and being able to drain those once the debuff started also it looks like there is a lot of unnecessary movement as well with periods of large gaps of casting esp around the time you took the first gateway try to anticipate where you need to be beforehand so as to minimize movement lastly you are double refreshing dots sometimes im not sure why you would be doing that there were or instances of you double refreshing dots to answer your question specifically whether its a slow or fast time phase is actually mostly irrelevant you should be making decisions about how many uas to dump based on damage buffs and hero obviously dont cap on shards and if youre running conduit ua until you have shards remaining depending on how if you have damage buffs running making sure not to apply more than you can check my chronomatic log or krosus log for both of these concepts in action
wow,not_removed,so questions like these are hard to answer because there isnt really a way for me to quantify how much changing gear around will help you having such low mastery is definitely a hindrance i roll with between and depending on what gear set im using but i cant give you a number regarding how much your dps will increase by changing that in regards to your actual play be using siphon life in single target in every single target fight sow the seeds should only be used for tich spellblade and skorp your uptimes on dots should be better youre not looking to pick up wrath of consumption stacks when you can dying to mechanics that should be avoidable etc i would check out the warlock discord there are a number of guides there in the resources tab that would likely benefit you immensely
wow,not_removed,psh never i always use the firelands seed pouch anyway which still has the old animation d
wow,not_removed,maybe its all in my head but i think run speed is faster now wo the prowl animations i did like the look of prowl though
wow,not_removed,boots gloves have a bit of negative synergy together due to gloves making you cast less shreds and the boots strength is buffing shreds with bloodtalons you also naturally get more predatory swiftness with the gloves as well kjbw might be good on aoe you have good legendaries but id recommend just simming it
wow,not_removed,feral is in a really good spot right now very good single target damage and good cleave fwiw feral has been ahead of boomkin single target damage for a while now
wow,not_removed,feral isnt bad at all feral does good damage if you can play the spec weve been good for almost all of the expac
wow,not_removed,current is very good for st and cleave i dont want to give precise numbers though i have conservative numbers from sims but approximately twice as good as for aoe the best tip overall is to play brutal slash its absolutely the best way to get good aoe numbers though you sacrifice approx single target if playing bloodtalons then just follow the priorities listed in the faq
wow,not_removed,sounds strange and i can see why this will be nerfed gonna try to farm some more ap so i can play around with it pre nerfs d
wow,not_removed,i got the same shoulders what kind of stacks whats the rumors
wow,not_removed,should i switch to mage if you like the class better are there buffs for dps in the future
wow,not_removed,id say but to be safe u could also sim your gear and see which one does more dps
wow,not_removed,try to minimize your movement try to move in between gcds after starsurge cast to maximize the stacks that you can get with ed sometimes you need to move more so you just need to drop off the stacks ye ed is pretty shit when it comes to prioritizing starfall over starsurge but since i dont really have anything else to replace it with i just go with it with the buff to the boots it could be better to use them if you dont really use starsurge in the fight but i dont have the leg so havent really bothered thinking about that
wow,not_removed,for m full aoe build sotf ss sd and treants and balance is pretty shit compared to fotms
wow,not_removed,i can assure you it does not work on eu
wow,not_removed,not op but i find running set tfoj and bow to be too many globals when combined together especially of you have the legendary cloak basically you spend too much time hitting your builders whereas with zeal the cd feels just right i do run tfoj with divine hammer though i still run dh on anything over targets for extended periods i dropped dh for bow in fights like chronomatic anomaly due to the adds dying so quickly same with elisande heroic not mythic
wow,not_removed,what are the ilvls of all of those trinkets you listed for progression for me ive been using metronome and burning sky the rng of whispers is insanely frustrating and its more of a parsing trinket than anything unless you have an insane ilvl on it the int alone is worth it i did use whispers on star auger progression though since its single target possibilities are much higher than burning sky an arcanocrystal is better than a metronome by a small margin so i would almost never take that off if i was you if you give me ilvls of all your trinkets i may adjust my recommendations here is a list of mythic fights and trinkets i use skorp metronome burning sky ca metronomekrosus orb trinketif you dont have an ele shaman this trinket is really good burning sky trilliax metronome burning skycould use whispers but the odds of getting burning sky procs on the big add are much higher than a whispers proc spell blade krosus orb trinket burning sky side note twins painful truth ring is really good on this fight krosus metronome whispers tich metronome burning sky star aug metronome whispers elisande metronome burning sky guldan metronome burning sky my recommendations for you skorp arcanocrystal burning sky ca arcanocrystal burning sky trilliax arcanocrystal burning sky spell blade arcanocrystal burning sky krosus arcanocrystal whispers tich arcanocrystal burning sky star aug arcanocrystal whispers elisande arcanocrystal burning sky guldan arcanocrystal burning sky
wow,not_removed,yes there is a point where your rotation goes from vb mb mfclipped vb mffull to vb mb vb mf you switch to the later rotaiton any time youre above haste this happens with pi and lust this can also happen with pi and really good metronome procs if you have the belt things can change a little bit you would just rotate between mb and vb as long as you have mb charges if you need or want a more clear explanation on this let me know
wow,not_removed,is a good target for a hero on pull so that isnt bad your target should be roughly void form uptime for the most part you almost always want to go into void form at insanity with the piece this allows you seconds of free moving as well since you can spam vb it depends on the adds but i wouldnt bother waiting most of the time i would just dot adds up after the vb spam even put some vbs into the adds if they are a priority target looking at your guarm kill your second void form was only seconds you want to be able to push that a few seconds longer to get in that void torrent ideally void forms look like this repeat the first one is pitorrent is torrent is nothing special then you should have pitorrent up again for the
wow,not_removed,sephuz bis legendary thats some nice meme on blizzards part
wow,not_removed,its a very stupid aprils fools joke from blizzard hopefully that out of all our legendaries our bis one is sephuz
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,get the vt swp and shadow dmg in this order then the new traits then the rest of your traits
wow,not_removed,hard to judge without seeing the fights in tos but in nighthold i consider us one of the if not best ranged dps classes
wow,not_removed,thank you
wow,not_removed,not babs but he has previously said that draught should be used after you use touch of death in your opener but before you use sef
wow,not_removed,dont worry too much about rankings they were reset in so the sample size is very small
wow,not_removed,windwalker pve artifact peak of serenity httpwwwpeakofserenitycomwindwalkerguidepveartifact windwalker pve legendaries peak of serenity httpwwwpeakofserenitycomwindwalkerguidepvelegendaries
wow,not_removed,right now it looks like the best way to go is capacitor and dhc and use serenity
wow,not_removed,thanks for the answer man i guess it must be the ping
wow,not_removed,death march legendary helm is crap even if it was buffed on patch really i thought if you have that and take defile you can go to town thanks for the analysis on btw never considered the mastery angle
wow,not_removed,i edited after you commented but can you chime in to the legendary bis items icy veins notes that you want the shoulders wowhead says they arent that good i would really like to play around with the valk talent but if its that bad then im not too sure if i would have fun all the time as uh is cof sought after for one of your trinkets with the legendary shoulders
wow,not_removed,i have the peice and bracers so my opening is normally prepot rw obliterate hb if time procs obliterate to finish off runes and then pillar breath hrw if rng is on your side or if you keep an eye on where youre rw cd timer is i try to make my first rw roll while sacrificing longevity of breath legendaries are nice and everyone wants sec breaths but really your job is blow your load during pillar if you can keep breath up during pillar then your job is complete for bos builds ive found that cof is by far the best thing you can get and need to get your hands on one asap
wow,not_removed,opener should be prepot hb to apply ff rw oblit × using any rime procs after that you will generally hold bos until you have recharged a set of runes bracers are still very good and actually better with the nerf to helm making it most likely our second choice behind the ring
wow,not_removed,moarg shines with up to mobs that are present most of the time or live long enough for the dot to tick and is a dps loss on st especially if you have the crit dmg on bladedance new artifact trait in case someone wonders on botanist it really shines here tichondrius take care of adds elisande potentially and guldan it seems to be good aluriel seems to be not that perfect for bloodlet the add uptime is to low and there are too much bladedance and eyebeam does significant better more damage thats what i read out of the warcraftlogs so far
wow,not_removed,with the recent buffs to moarg applying increase from first target hit bloodlet is stronger for st fights than first blood until you got your trait after that first blood will again be strongest to use as of cleave i believe bloodlet is strongest but you will have to sim that yourself havent had time to test for cleave and aoe situations yet
wow,not_removed,yes i indeed am i am using moarg on st and cleave fights since bloodlet with moarg and only with moarg is stronger than the first blood talent when you get your trait moarg becomes useless again and you can continue to use sephuz or symbiote or we you got
wow,not_removed,hello so your legendaries are symbiote sephuz loramus and anger if so for most raid bosses where you meta on pull symbiote and anger will be your go to legendaries for any fight where youre not using meta on pull i would say sephuz loramus is probably your best bet for huge aoe packs like pulls for anything below that i would run anger and sephuz but it really depends on your build what you replace certain slots with etc sim yourself for the best results
wow,not_removed,i was wondering this as well at fury its not worth the cost and channeling time since youll always be able to chaos strike instead which is more consistent at fury the fact that it always crits could still prove useful if youre too low on fury for cs and everything else is on cd so instead of wasting a gcd on nothing you can eye beam and do some burst damage and give time for felblade or blade dance to come off cooldown and give you an extra melee cycle for db or felblade to proc seems it could have a situational use
wow,not_removed,head shoulders and sephuzs using head and ring right now sitting at ilvl and doing really well compared to the people i join up with just want to see if there are any changes i can make to improve it ive been stacking mastery first and crit second mostly ill sim for hectic add see what it says
wow,not_removed,can you feel when your abilities arent going off thats usually how i can tell if im out of range frankly no ive been playing dh and so a lot of my abilities have more range than my auto attacks seem to particularly eye beams its to the point where im almost outdamaging the normal build with demonic beam build simply because im missing out on so many autos that i dont have enough fury generation im doing okay at utility its my damage thats lacking because im not good at making sure that im consistantly autoattacking particularly if im not using the demons bite beam build
wow,not_removed,no worries some of it might not make sense but i tried to make it not too hard to read if you can get on the discord they have some good information like bis items and a proper guide im not sure of the actual link but if you google wow class discords it should be there
wow,not_removed,oh wow i did haha usually dont even notice since ive got it all macrod together
wow,not_removed,raging blow takes up a gcd which is very bad when youre using bloodthirst every gcd as well as never using rampage to get enraged if youre not using furious slash to increase your chance to get enraged you will likely not have enough rage for execute as being enraged adds a lot more rage and damage over time than raging blow does upfront raging blow is unnecessary when you could build rage to use execute which hits harder at all times raging blow can be useful for a very short execute phase where its unlikely youll even get to or so stacks of juggernaut but only when youre likely not to even use the full duration of your next enrage before the target dies
wow,not_removed,juggernaut is refreshed with another stack every time you execute and lasts seconds you need to make sure youre using and are able to use execute at all times to not lose the buff because your goal is to get it to stacks i stay above rage at all times because bloodthirst will give me at least rage this means in an emergency where ive been stunned or otherwise removed from the boss for a couple seconds i dont have to finish the rest of my rotation and pray for enrage to give me more rage before i can execute to keep the buff up if im on rage with no stacks of bloodthirst and i havent been able to execute for a couple seconds already the likelihood of me losing my juggernaut stacks is very high as theres no way to generate that much rage in a couple seconds without bc keeping that rage for the last second of juggernaut is just like a safety net to help keep the buff up when youre getting unlucky a good example would be tich during execute phase when he casts echoes you cant just stand there and keep executing because youll die you need enough rage when you come back in to execute straight away and pooling some helps to make that easier you wont be in a rush to mass generate rage before echoes is cast
wow,not_removed,ive been told that getting to rage is bad because you need to use every last drop of rage on executes if i gained rage over cap every time i went from rage id lose out on or executes over the fight due to the rage loss and if i was to stay near the rage cap id be wasting even more rage while hitting cap
wow,not_removed,you know that in youll get caught up to your arms artifact right legit youll be like or traits behind your arms one switch now if you want to play fury legit no better time to switch than now
wow,not_removed,if i was to log a dummy if you can even do that im not sure could you tell me rotationally where im messing up i have seperate gear for arms but havent messed much with it and its been so long ill have to research proper weight stats etc is the focused rage spec still the only viable one
wow,not_removed,whats the command to change it
wow,not_removed,i find it easier to react to procs since i find myself having to react extremely late in casts sometimes
wow,not_removed,holy shit d well thanks for explaining
wow,not_removed,can you make it crit by casting a frostbolt the one thing im confused about in the guide on altered times you just posted is when the op talks about casting flurry while also having fof can you maybe elaborate does casting frostbolt have an impact on the flurry damage this changes when you have the legendary gloves and bracers if you have both its better to do the opposite cast frostbolt il and then start over for the frostbolt bf il combo fof procs are more valuable dpswise compared to not having those legendaries and you want to avoid munching them at all costs if you only have of those legendaries then its pretty much a neutral gain stick to the first way
wow,not_removed,is a cap not a breakpoint you dont aim for it you just dont go over it theres no fire crit amount you aim for either its your best stat you just stack it
wow,not_removed,heres my best try at star augur it is a bit old now however
wow,not_removed,okay good tip i need a stat stick with about crit for so maybe that would be nice
wow,not_removed,hmm thats weird on krosus he delayed meteor by before casting or wasnt captured on logs but my preferred opener would be prepot meteor secs before pull normal combust rotation another thing to note he shouldnt be casting more fireballs than pyroblasts get him to work on getting hot streak procs instead of just spamming fireballs hoping for crit procs if thats what hes doing just take a glimpse at my log if he wants to isnt the best logs but its something to help him out hopefully
wow,not_removed,yes and then fire off the hs pyro with the hard cast pyro
wow,not_removed,increase the damage of that pyro if that super pyro crits fire blast will give you a stack of pi thats extra crit damage which is more damage and a lot more damage on your super pyro if that pyro crits its important to explain thoroughly and in depth it helps your understanding and others
wow,not_removed,i believe hes talking about the trick shot build ive maybe mistakenly doing what you posted then just rotating arcsms over and over fitting in ll procs also if its not the opener and im using ts for singletarget ill slip a windburst in on cdnot sure if that part is correct or not though i imagine it will be w the new talents
wow,not_removed,if what youre saying is true about the then the wording on the spellset is absolutely atrocious flanking strike has double the normal chance to trigger hunting companion from the spell and then flanking strike now has times the normal chance to trigger hunting companion from the set
wow,not_removed,i can see where that might definitely be an issue especially for you mythic raiders i play pretty casually so i just play whatever i find most enjoyable
wow,not_removed,tbh id rather they not take away symbol or nightblade before legion sub had to keep track of slice n dice rupture and hemo uptimes while doing the standard rotation they canned all three of those abilities so without symbol or nb sub would be boring af the aoe playstyle of sub leaves much to be desired but sub has never been about aoe although i do like the proposed changes with fok just buffing eviscerate and using aoe to strengthen our single target
wow,not_removed,they will make symbols go away with but then we might have to save one of our dances for sodgonna need tweaking maybe it will be perma active only during sd or something
wow,not_removed,i unfortunately just switched to rogue and still dont have my or but have mantle woooo would i vanishrupture
wow,not_removed,meh i thought that difference was going to be drastically lower o well might change in
wow,not_removed,sub is getting things removed too losing a dance charge ds change is huge
wow,not_removed,i also think if they are making a major change like this with a possibly large margin of error on their part just wait for a new xpax where everyone starts fresh instead of literally the middle of an expansion pack where charactersspecs are wellestablished
wow,not_removed,as far as cd usage goes lining stuff up isnt that important planning a little ahead of your cooldowns is important though for example kingsbane keep a couple combo points and a little energy saved up a couple seconds before it comes off cd so you can keep envenom up for the entire duration vanish pool as much energy as you can set up combo points for a rupture if youre playing nightstalker or a max duration garrote if playing subterfuge vendetta refresh a rupture sometime before it so you can spend all your combo points during vendetta on envenoms and as far as the shoulders go the opener i use which has been very successful is garrote muti rupture muti envenom kingsbane vendetta muti envenom muti wait until remaining on kingbane debuff vanish envenom muti garrote envenom draught of souls im not sure what youd replace this with if you dont have draught you can also look through some of my logs if you want a reference point
wow,not_removed,do you think it would surpass the legendary trinket in most aoe situations and im assuming its better in all single target situations as it sims higher than it already with no procs
wow,not_removed,the uptime on lr is pretty insane and high mastery makes it so you have a ton of procs
wow,not_removed,honestly thats partially because icefury got such a bad reputation for being too complicated to be worth it or we so many people avoid it as a result its a shame too because it provides amazing options to keep up your dps on heavymovement fights like trilliaxelisandeguldan i dont even play the spec optimally and i still dont really have trouble keeping up with other ranged in my group
wow,not_removed,wordup said that it doesnt affect the rotation at all
wow,not_removed,im aware im just saying its something to curtail the buffs
wow,not_removed,movement isnt the reason why your cancelling drain soul before fully casted is straight bad
wow,not_removed,going to depend on your stats and trinkets yipz i believe has two good trinkets arcanocrystal and whispers if you only have one of those kiljaedens may be better for you
wow,not_removed,ah right i forgot the pants got more secondary stats go off of yipzs list then
wow,not_removed,i dont take advice from wimpy humansfor the horde
wow,not_removed,thanks for the indepth response
wow,not_removed,thank you for your advice for the double refreshing thing i think this was because of the new change to spell queuing that i hit the buttons a few times because of how unresponsive it felt resulting in a double cast i distinctly remember a couple of instances of that and the movement thing is definitely biting me in the ass and another question lets say i have corruption and sl at seconds and agony expiring in about i wont have enough time to do a full ua drain should i just do a drain and then refresh the dots or ua drain let the dots fall off and reapply them once the drain is finished or interrupt the drain to refresh dots
wow,not_removed,correct answer d
wow,not_removed,the tiny little steps always looked funny d im fine with the new animation too
wow,not_removed,ive had a really hard time sticking to anything i have played in the past this expansion i finally tried feral and i really loved it but everything i read was gloom and doom you never get groups feral bad you know the meme
wow,not_removed,thank you never tried brutal slash but will do
wow,not_removed,one of the new talents of the balance weapon is wax and wane with that we are able to stack moonfire and now with recent hotfix sunfire times for additional damage edit if you play guardian too they are incredible useful for m im using luffas and latc and the dps is huge with the recent patch moonfire dmg is usually always on top
wow,not_removed,i think that there was blue post that said blizz wants to take a look at balance with
wow,not_removed,and i have wrist legendary what to go with killjaden or waist or new boots both for aoe and st
wow,not_removed,for m full aoe build sotf ss sd and treants and balance is pretty shit compared to fotms fotm ie affl warlock cant think of any other rdps that are fotm of the top of my head
wow,not_removed,for me it deals damage from its end destination and then back towards me so if i am stood and in front of me theres one mob and behind it another and i cast divine storm towards them it hits the one furthest back first and then the damage comes back to the mob closest to me very strange
wow,not_removed,glad to hear were all suffering equally
wow,not_removed,oh sorry i should have mentioned the ilvl its metronome whispers burning sky and arcanocrystal also thanks for the list
wow,not_removed,thank you for the explanation the clear haste number helps a lot should i be wanting to use the belt currently i use bracers kj trink mainly because my backup belt is hastemast while my backup trinket is an metronome or an fury thank you again
wow,not_removed,thanks a bunch i usually do the if everything goes right so my next move is definitely getting vf uptime right cheers
wow,not_removed,oh yes i dont have sephuz so it skipped my mind but yes sephuz is crazy good for shadow after the buff
wow,not_removed,found it for you dump getcvarspellqueuewindow to check the current amount console spellqueuewindow change the number according to your needs there is also a separate command for custom lag tolerance but i wouldnt really advise fiddling with that unless you have a good pc because it causes terrible fps drops for me and some people i know google it if you want with keywords like gcd lag at high haste or ui lag at high haste etc
wow,not_removed,thats correct
wow,not_removed,if you have dhc and are using serenity should haste take stat priority until you can comfortably fit fof into every serenity
wow,not_removed,for single target yes for cleave fights i think the helm still pulls ahead nh encounters have cleave
wow,not_removed,well yeah but thats for multiple targets for single targets and mechanics that needed to move around much id still take soul reaper over defile plus if you use ebon fever as talents that is much better than taking in defile as virulent plague is a beast on multiple targets partner it with dnd and cs spam
wow,not_removed,wristkjbwprydaz are very good
wow,not_removed,legendary shoulders with dark arbiter is good for short fights on long fights however its under performing compared to soul reaper wrists are good even with clawing shadows though i still prefer using prydaz and kiljaedens because of the stats those legendaries provide i dont have cof yet so i didnt get to play with dark arbiter imo legendary shoulders is below average but not crap
wow,not_removed,please by all means help players with questions but at least be worthful of your information bloodlet is at the moment stronger than first blood on st fights until you get trait its great to help just make sure you know what youre talking about first edit it does not shine on botanist mythic since all that matters here are single target dps yes you can be smart and maybe do stuff with hitting a previous target and getting the damage increase off on the main target but that seems not worth it after my testing only on hc does it really shine its only good on tichondrius for padding since the adds actually have about seconds lifespan once youre told to kill them off so if youre out for padding yes they are indeed great elisande good for the dot you can put on elisande for range and the target cleave that live fairly long and guldan is meh since he is often alone and the adds die withing seconds usually why the fuck even compare eye beam to bloodlet makes no sense at all also blade dance does not make more damage until trait
wow,not_removed,yea ive got boots sephuz anger ring moarg head chest and the aoe trinket moarg and anger seems the best option for me anyway
wow,not_removed,thanks a ton have a good one
wow,not_removed,what are your recommendaitions for macros
wow,not_removed,it might depend on gear and fight length but it seems juggling frothing berserker while maintaining juggernaut is the way to go personally i dont like the feel of that though so i mostly do what you do but if i can proc fb i take it as a nice bonus
wow,not_removed,if you are using the legendary head you will be able to hit frothing without going much over cap at all with execute bt fs as well as keeping up a decent speed of juggernaut stacks if you dont have it well its gonna be a little harder
wow,not_removed,you should its an incredibly detailed guide for arms that i use personally to great effect
wow,not_removed,best to log a real fight since a dummy wont log your execute phase at all
wow,not_removed,here ya go
wow,not_removed,can you make it crit by casting a frostbolt nope but you make the frostbolt crit by casting flurry right after as for your point hes basically talking about what you do if you frostbolt and it procs both fof and bf while youre casting your next frostbolt without those legendaries you cast frostbolt and flurry at the end of your frostbolt followed by an ice lance this is because the risk of munching a flurry is a bigger dps loss than just munching the ice lance with those legendaries however fof becomes more important so if you get both procs again you just cast the ice lance at the end of your frostbolt because munching the fof is a bigger dps loss than munching a brain freeze
wow,not_removed,isnt haste actually better in some regard with bonus simming the highest for me atm sitting at crit gemmed and enchanted haste
wow,not_removed,i think youre doing fine for your legendaries and kill times just a few little things prioritize fire blast over pf in combustion and make sure you save as many fire blasts for combustion as you can some of your pf usage is kinda weird how i consider the best usage of pf if youve just finished a pyrofireball combo and only crits as the pyro gcd gives you time to react to the proc if you need to move with a heating up proc if you have no heating up proc and have cast fireballs without a crit pf at the end of the next fireball to guarantee hot streak but i think youre doing fine tbh
wow,not_removed,dont focus on getting to just dont go over it right now i have crit and i sim the best there with my gear combos usually once you get close to crit starts tapering off its a crit cap not a breaking pointmeaning that you dont want to go over it what other trinkets do you have you might already have something in your bag thats better
wow,not_removed,im aware its bullshit wording but we tweeted the developers and they confirmed it edit also normal chance from set makes sense in a way
wow,not_removed,yeah for me whatever is the highest dps is the most enjoyable it might sound strange but i really just dont enjoy playing a spec when i know i could do more if they suddenly make sub the top dog then ill respec but then ill have to farm for legendaries again especially since the mantle nerffix
wow,not_removed,i wish symbols was shorter free and more powerful to mimic the old find weakness a bit make it actually worth to use a few backstabs and finishers after a shadow dance
wow,not_removed,yeah theyll make it so symbols will just be macroed into every shadow dance i dont see the point in even having the ability anymore then all itll do is that you cant spam shadow dances id much rather it was way stronger but also way shorter youd have enough time to spend all your excess cp after a dance and you get a few extra strong backstabs in aswell like the old find weakness but then as a buff and not a debuff on a target
wow,not_removed,id be inclined to say yes rupture i only got my mantle after i got so honestly im not completely sure either way try and get and enjoy those juicy envenom crits
wow,not_removed,keep in mind that theres a sec icd which means that its not even possible to go below sec cd and yeah youll go with dp by default by the looks of it in
wow,not_removed,losing a dance charge doesnt really affect the scaling of sub though and can be easily tuned around ap is the reason why assa scales so well and im afraid well stop scaling very well after
wow,not_removed,i wouldnt even mind large sweeping changes like this if they just gave us the option to target legendaries id love to play sub and outlaw properly but id have to switch my lootspec to sub then and i only have a chance of getting a decent sub legendary its so demotivating that i just dont bother
wow,not_removed,exactly what i needed to know i cant access the rogue website atm in my work although i can get on reddit but ill have a look once im finished today youre absolutely correct about the rupture it was more of an ifwhen question but in reality i should just ensure im not in that situation the sot detail is something ive been curious about for awhile so thanks for the clarity
wow,not_removed,sephuz is our best aoe legendary by almost second place assuming aoe means being able to knock down with eq against targets st the sim includes the passive increase if you want to see how it performs while proccing it put an interruptible cast event every x seconds but yes it would be towards the top our legendaries are overall not amazing we have some very bad ones but none that are leagues ahead of anything else heres some legendary sims if youd like to look at them traits mythic nh gear sephuz is not procced st but is on beastlord and aoe note that you can look at different fight types and talents using the tabs at the bottom
wow,not_removed,sadly i dont have either of those leggies so the best thing i could do is check the rankings for each boss and look what parsed best sure its not all that reliable but its the best idea i could come up with it probably also depends on the trinket you would equip instead of the leggie one sephuz a stat stick would probably sim lower than average ring leggie trinket
wow,not_removed,yeah i just simmed myself in lr and increased this is amazing i really disliked ascendance
wow,not_removed,it is not only that it is harder it performs worse even with light movement why play something that is both harder and weaker and with the new higher es cap icefury is falling even further behind the talent build needs help ideally through traits it isnt simply a matter of being too hard
wow,not_removed,wish i know what did you ment here
wow,not_removed,explain
wow,not_removed,if you have seconds left just use ua drain and refresh either way your dots should never be that unsyched assuming you dont have a burn phase coming up or are about to pot or whatnot if you do refresh and then apply ua
wow,not_removed,its insanely underrated you compete with top tier aoe classes playing it
wow,not_removed,good thing i saved trait in my balance weapon then definitely gonna try it out a hotfix of it was mentioned tho is it really that powerful
wow,not_removed,boots are probably the second best legendary you have available in most scenarios kj might be better in super aoe situations though
wow,not_removed,hunters mages spriests ele shams and locks are all really strong if talking about rdps ofc balance druids can also pull numbers but i would most likely prefer another class if i was a leader of a m grp
wow,not_removed,my paladin seemed to work fine but then a friend of me has been sending rage messages on facebook because his divine storm hits absolutely nothing seems like its another layer of legion rng hit chance is set to
wow,not_removed,first of all im jealous of your arcanocrystal second no changes to the list those are still my recommendations based on my experience
wow,not_removed,what are your backup bracers bracer nerf hit them decently hard now they arent number any more how to priest sims most of the legendaries at a of each other though i dont have trinket so i dont have any experience playing around with it bracers kj seems fine since you have that belt but my suggestion would be to play around with it do a farm fight that doesnt matter and see how you do you might like the double mb play style better i always say take sims with a grain of salt and use some actual thought and play testing before making a final decision
wow,not_removed,rather than crazy good i would call it better than the mediocre shit we currently have but still mediocre
wow,not_removed,i just tested it in lfr and a mythic dungeon works fine so far thanks a ton
wow,not_removed,is that for st would sef still be best for aoe
wow,not_removed,no you either do it with lust or not at all
wow,not_removed,it is however not very far ahead anymore as beltring allow for more obliterates causing more rime procs and generally will allow better stacking of gs it will only be fights with a large amount of cleave that it will pull ahead on becuase of this so tichskorp type fights are the only ones youll see a real difference anymore
wow,not_removed,going with lege bracers and bloodlet is extremely worth on mythic botanist atm just focus the last boss you kill and always tg at your focus target this way your tg will always hit the boss you are killing either second or third this weeks logs also back this up
wow,not_removed,it is the best option for you currently until trait then i believe sephuz will be better but you should sim that
wow,not_removed,i would just have a macro that casts your cooldowns then rampage cast avatar cast battle cry cast rampage for some reason rampage cannot be cast on the first press and is instead activated after casting the macro a second time this means during execute phase you can just press the macro once and you shouldnt use all your rage on rampage
wow,not_removed,thanks much appreciated
wow,not_removed,ah frostbolt crits because of winters chill and shatter of course thanks for explaining so ebonbolt also crits when flurry is casted right after i guess
wow,not_removed,it sims the highest for me too it really just depends on your stats
wow,not_removed,the one i have equipped and i think i have a brinewater with mastery aswell the erratic metronome which is nasty so im not taking that off
wow,not_removed,i forgot about the sec icd lame
wow,not_removed,a lot of locks refresh drain before it ends so we have no down time between drains
wow,not_removed,thanks again my man
wow,not_removed,good to know that will end my worries when i play m as feral
wow,not_removed,i dont know thats my question here too
wow,not_removed,tbh id rather have the legendaries that we have as opposed to being dependent on one or two of them
wow,not_removed,well draught is only a single target trinket so hopefully you can switch an aoe trinket in
wow,not_removed,wasnt that exactly what i was implying a bit tho havent been on bota mythic in tho but didnt work out great in nice to hear its worth it in
wow,not_removed,youre absolutely correct
wow,not_removed,yes thank you im always simming anyway just wasnt sure about pure st fights
wow,not_removed,so we run around with like buttons to hit if we have macros haha
wow,not_removed,you probably need to set a delay for the gcd most macros fail when you dont set a gcd delay
wow,not_removed,yes as long as you are away also you can cast ebonbolt and flurry right at the end whether or not you have a brain freeze as if you dont have a brain freeze it generates one right away and if you do have a brain freeze it delays the proc slightly to give you time to use the first one
wow,not_removed,of course it would be mastery the writ would probably outdps the mastery brinewater since it will have a little more int and have crit here and there
wow,not_removed,it couldve had some potential to be completely broken without it though imagine if you can aoe constantly youd just spam fok and reduce the cooldown on kingsbane to under seconds now if you reapply kingsbane more duration will just get added onto it every time you poison that target kingsbane deals more damage but because you can extend the duration indefinitely maybe you could keep adding indefinitely aswell sure it sucks that we wont be able to multidot kingsbane when theres a load of targets but being able to get a kingsbane to tick for million per tick isnt really good for the game as a whole ps this is pure speculation maybe kingsbane would refresh stacks when it reapplies i think blizzard just covered themselves before anyone could try and find a way to abuse it
wow,not_removed,me too but thats usually drain to tick then drain to full then i have to refresh dotsuas so at least theres full drain
wow,not_removed,hey i count odyns fury and furious slash as buttons too but yeah pretty much its a very easy spec to play once you get the rotation down
wow,not_removed,ah thats why i read all about why distance from target as a frost mage is so clunky when it comes to casting flurry before your proc shows up that i already experienced quite some time thanks
wow,not_removed,yeah the brinewater of full unluckyness hopefully wqs this week gimme a stat stick with crit or maybe doing some broken shore i can get a sweet one
wow,not_removed,lol that would be hilarious it would be rolling ignites all over again good times
wow,not_removed,ah thats why i read all about why distance from target as a frost mage is so clunky yeah its a minigame in itself when you have to be close to double ice lance and far away to shatter
wow,not_removed,yeah i havent gotten a brine to drop for me but at this point im kinda surpassing it with my trinkets unless i get a really lucky tf one
wow,not_removed,does it have a knockback is it near a ledge arathi basin lumbermill taught me the hard way that if the answer is yesyes then you gon get fucked
wow,not_removed,good job you got rid of two demon hunters
wow,not_removed,this is the most wood league clip ive ever seen
wow,not_removed,shudders that meta artifact though
wow,not_removed,clickers
wow,not_removed,this isnt just clicking this is advanced clicking youre literally clicking your most used abilities like solar wrath while leaving several keybinds empty it is actually incredible to me you made it to the while clicking i wouldve hated this game by level if i had to click my extremely basic abilities
wow,not_removed,nice play you should learn to use more hotkeys clicking is very inefficient especially in pvp
wow,not_removed,sick play do u need help keybinding
wow,not_removed,i always wondered what the super slow moving backpeddling people looked like on their end in pvp kinda fascinating really you should probably bind that stuff up the game is really friendly with its super low amount of abilities now
wow,not_removed,he only clicks the solar wrath right he dots with the keybinds and then typhoons at the end dunno maybe he had a sudden urge to scratch his ass or something
wow,not_removed,you can see the demonhunter hesitating and foreseeing his doom that other demonhunter though what a surprise lol
wow,not_removed,rekt
wow,not_removed,man how to people not understand eots yet i always liked going elemental just to thunderstorm people off the flag and into the abyss
wow,not_removed,the clicking tho
wow,not_removed,the best part is when the friendly demonhunter chases him off the cliff
wow,not_removed,as a demon hunter main that was painful to watch
wow,not_removed,i was going to upvote but saw you were a clicker
wow,not_removed,clicking and keyboard turning may god have mercy on your soul
wow,not_removed,dear everyone shut the fuck up and let the bastard click his abilities if he wants to this is a game
wow,not_removed,two demon hunters for the price of one
wow,not_removed,you can see he thought about not doing it too
wow,not_removed,cant stop wont stop
wow,not_removed,click
wow,not_removed,the clicking made me cringe
wow,not_removed,was was that guy clicking
wow,not_removed,its funny because you see him being careful standing and waiting for fel blade because hes afraid to charge off the ledge
wow,not_removed,uasianbarmitzvah this is what looks like in wow
wow,not_removed,clicking scrub
wow,not_removed,rforhonor
wow,not_removed,the clicking omggggggg triggered
wow,not_removed,god the click on the wrath just made me cringe into another dimension
wow,not_removed,ugh clicking almost everything even button made me puke
wow,not_removed,this was some of the most obvious bait ive ever seen the difference is i play rogue so i can try and look cool as hell shadowstepping back to the player it only fails of the times i try it but i feel cool when it works
wow,not_removed,eots is hell for that combo
wow,not_removed,some of my best wow moments as a youth were playing a priest at lm simply for the hilarity of mind controlling players off the cliff
wow,not_removed,is he a priest am i near a ledge oh shit
wow,not_removed,i play monk and if i get ab i just sit at lm with transcendence at the edge the best is when a druid stealths up to me and blows me off and i appear right behind him again
wow,not_removed,houlon for me
wow,not_removed,i always stand back for a few seconds during the initial rush for lm gotta wait for that perfect moment when most of the melee are near the edge
wow,not_removed,this is why i always have plenty of avalanche potions if im at lm and im getting overrun and its a lost cause i just jump off and hit my potion saves me a death its also fucking cool looking and satisfying
wow,not_removed,unless you a warrior that can literally charge back while being knocked back or a monklock with the ability to teleport back
wow,not_removed,my favorite mc spot was black rock mountain back in the day you had tons of traffic with brs brd molten core blackwings
wow,not_removed,yeah all i could think was dumbass
wow,not_removed,i leave gaps in my bars to make sure i dont accidentally use something i didnt mean to by fat fingering keys leap of faith and bloodlust are the big ones here i have no idea why you would do it with regular rotational spells though perhaps whatever used to be in his got pruned
wow,not_removed,because i play several characters i tend to put spells on my bars in locations that are similar to other characters spells for example is pretty much my defensive cool down on all characters there are some exceptions to this but most classes dont have one for one abilities there for some spots get left blank
wow,not_removed,i think he is ising a razer mouse and doesnt use the top line of keys maybe
wow,not_removed,he probably rebound those keys to different barsbuttons and that isnt his main a year ago i found myself in a bg in an offspec on an alt just after a ui change and clicking major abilities too although usually when stuff like that happens im thrown into an irl blood frenzy and throw everything off my desk and leave the bginstance
wow,not_removed,i use a sidebutton mmo mouse i keep a lot of my procd spells across characters on because its comfy is way out of the way and sometimes i dont have anything there at all
wow,not_removed,i have certain spots where i need to have moves my interrupt is always on short movement like roll and blink are on or depending on how it works and so on on my bm hunter i have so few abilities that i fit in my main rotation that i leave and blank
wow,not_removed,dunno about druid but i bind my abilities to similar keys e is always interrupt f is always an instant lowno cost ability and if there isnt one ill leave it blank
wow,not_removed,just let the dude play his wow in peace
wow,not_removed,if only that effect was permanentp
wow,not_removed,one day one day ill finally get good enough to break into wood league
wow,not_removed,it was a failed flash predction s
wow,not_removed,a demon hunter fell to his death by the hand of a backpedaling clicker how embarrassing leordnardostormreaver how do you plead
wow,not_removed,what if i do both click and shortcut
wow,not_removed,he clicks boom kin form too
wow,not_removed,i dont think hes hesitating looks more like hes a clicker too
wow,not_removed,tyrannosaurus rekt
wow,not_removed,as a player in general this was painful to watch from both sides
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,this has been a thing for years before rforhonor dont try and make this a thing
wow,not_removed,i think thats the whole point of the clip
wow,not_removed,thats the point of the unexpected bit the second dh got fucked over by the charge
wow,not_removed,it only fails of the times of the time it works every time
wow,not_removed,meanwhile there is the demon hunter pvp talent that makes them fly into the sky and super saiyan fight with each other as if ledges will stop them
wow,not_removed,i had happily repressed that memory
wow,not_removed,once a priest mcd me there and when i broke it i guess he didnt notice he was controlling his own character again and jumped straight off lol
wow,not_removed,the best mc was having gammon kick players in orgrimar and dismounting them
wow,not_removed,back in my wow days you could typhoon someone off a mount mid flight they would fall to their death but as long as you were high enough and they got out of reach you would leave combat and go straight back to bird form
wow,not_removed,thats also how i tank cordana just waiting to feel like a boss if she decides to kick me off of course i could yknow not stand close enough to the edge but that wouldnt be as badass
wow,not_removed,i do it as a heals in the middle of eye of the storm where the flag is its a sheer drop with only a little cliff so the mc timer for the enemy doesnt go off soon enough to pull a last minute leap path not found path not found path not found
wow,not_removed,id walk in to brm and thered be like shadowpriests perched like vultures waiting for horde
wow,not_removed,leap of faith and bloodlust are the big ones here this is the reason why i dont have these keybound i have keybound nearly anything but stuff like this not same for my prepotpot lof on the other hand is vuhdobound
wow,not_removed,i have the last button on action near mapped to tilde i put silence macros there but for my priest who doesnt have an interrupt as holy i have leap of faith
wow,not_removed,i have a blank key where a major spell i used was combined with another spell shadowburnconflag so i leave it empty so i dont accidentally use muscle memory to hit the wrong thing
wow,not_removed,i have a consistent keymapping for every single class so i have gaps in my buttons like the interrupt slot is empty for healers some secondary aoe slots are empty etc
wow,not_removed,i learned this the hardway in nighthold apparently my fury warrior has commanding shout right next to taunt
wow,not_removed,i have my bloodlust on r coming back from playing league i think of it as my ult d
wow,not_removed,i do the same all interrupts are ctrl e all movement abilities are q and e main resource generators are resource spenders alt is pvp trinket etc
wow,not_removed,but then heals arent bound for resto affinity i dunno
wow,not_removed,it was a zoningult
wow,not_removed,rleagueoflegends is leaking
wow,not_removed,httpusbattlenetwowencharacterstormreaverleordnardosimple he sacrificed his belt
wow,not_removed,to be fair his movement the meta what he did after the meta everything points into one direction he is a clicker aswell
wow,not_removed,why is backpedalling bad not good at pvping
wow,not_removed,why do you click if you have shortcuts
wow,not_removed,honest question just made a druid should i bind boomkin form im literally never not in that form and didnt see anything about it being in a rotation
wow,not_removed,well yea kinda thats assuming i dont run off the edge after stepping back to the person i mean thats obviously never happened to me but it could a lot maybe
wow,not_removed,i used to do that too so much fun
wow,not_removed,the wars in brm were pretty fun you would have a massive fight that would be continually reinforced by different raid groups showing up to do mc then you would get the people who just wanted to startpick fights who would get a guild pissed and once that happened it would usually end up with a full on war and people getting yelled at over vent to just ignore the alliance and get into brd for the run to the instance
wow,not_removed,at least he has his priorities straight
wow,not_removed,i have a key for bl though to make sure i dont hit it accidently i made it ctrlshiftalth pretty much everything is keyed to some combo
wow,not_removed,bloodlust is for me easy to smash when needed but never accidentally
wow,not_removed,if your concern is fat fingering why not just bind big cooldowns to multiple keys ie for lust ive always used shiftt for big defensive cds like bubble or touch of karma i use shiftf or shifts still pretty easy to press without a huge risk of fat fingering imo its better to do it this way than to leave it up to clicking if its a spell you need to use immediately
wow,not_removed,my opener is through and then its back to the regular keyboard keys
wow,not_removed,on healers i put dispel where i usually have interrupt call it the sephuz button only gets awkward when playing resto or mw and have to bind both dispel and interrupt generally this is when the shift key gets involved
wow,not_removed,league of legends in lol
wow,not_removed,what have you given
wow,not_removed,its amazing how people click with an easy class with the least amount of buttons next to a frost dk like cmon
wow,not_removed,theres one more gem hidden in this clip a second dh lunged to his death chasing after him dblvisiondarkspear why
wow,not_removed,your snaring yourself strafing is much more effective because theres no movement speed loss
wow,not_removed,for my right hand can do something
wow,not_removed,for pvp switching forms gets u out of slows and shit so yes if u pvp and probly should anyways if swapping to cat for movespeed ever sounds useful
wow,not_removed,bind travel form and boomkin to the same but with a modifier that should be enough if you pvp i say bind maybe bear or cat as well
wow,not_removed,having to shift to other forms using blinks heals etc binding moonkin form makes it easy to go back to the right form
wow,not_removed,but only hypothetically
wow,not_removed,mine its shiftctrlv for the same reason
wow,not_removed,i hope for your sake delete isnt bound or for that matter
wow,not_removed,stuff like bubble or tok is always bound to the same key my defensive key no chance at fatfingering it stuff like lust is a bit away just because of the big cd and because it can fuck up a progress try
wow,not_removed,everything my liege everything
wow,not_removed,i honestly cant imagine clicking with a havoc dh theres way too much moving and too much haste during the opener what the fuck
wow,not_removed,dhs dont have that few buttons just that their actual dmg rotation is super simple lots of cdstalentable abilities and utility
wow,not_removed,thats the entire point of the clip thats not hidden
wow,not_removed,exactly
wow,not_removed,the amount of times i have almost bound alt to a defensive while making my normal keybindings on a new alt is kinda embarrassing i mean it would be the ultimate defensive though so scurred of that boss damage i logged the fuck out
wow,not_removed,fun fact i used to have my shaman heal bound to only took one time trying to pop a self heal to figure out why that was a bad idea
wow,not_removed,nothing is bound to either delete or i dont even use the f keys
wow,not_removed,you literally cant do it without losing several dps
wow,not_removed,thats bullshit are you even serious not only is our dmg rotation super simple we also dont have any other kind of depth really the current build for m has active abilites make that because of of those is the gliding that doesnt count the current singletarget build that you use for almost all boss fights has active abilities if you dont count glide what lots of cdstalentable abilities and utility do we have not counting talents we have cooldowns meta and blur three of our talent tiers hold only passive abilities so thats a maximum of talentable abilities and what utility do we have actually chaosnova darkness imprison and spectral sight considering that spectral sight is pretty much useless outside of pvp thats defenitly not a lot of utility at all havoc dh is as unfinished as it gets and i fucking hate it
wow,not_removed,i have gorefiends grasp bound to on my blood bars i have force self cast on alt i use clique to gorefiends grasp on myself
wow,not_removed,gorefiends grasp for my blood spec
wow,not_removed,yes you are right i just checked some of my other characters for actual buttons and utility my claim wasnt really true at all but i do still feel like dhs do a lot of things more so in pvp propably because thats where i mainly play it spell like consume magic blur vengeful retreat the artifact ability blade dance have some bonus stuff in their tooltip that makes them more useful i guess i definitely have to agree that dhs could use some cool flavor spells mainly comparing it to my shaman things like a purge astral recall are really missing guess blizz thinks that the double jump glide thing makes up for it and i have to agree that it does for a while i can definitely see it becoming boring though
wow,not_removed,yeah i can see your point theres a lot of cool stuff hidden in the toolkit like that second dodge for bladedance and spells like reverse magic and spectral sight combined with the unique mobility give it an interesting playstyle in pvp sometimes still especially for pvp i would love to see a bunch of new abilities playing arena often ends up being a boring beatonthehealer session but i guess other classes suffer from this problem aswell i would also like to see a more challenging rotation for singletarget the only thing that makes the class somewhat hard to play is managing momentum correctly but its just a talent and not even the best of its tier currently i think the class needs some unique rotation that is not just dump fury
wow,not_removed,survival hunter is still in a bad spot my only skills that good boosted are the ones you barely use i like the trailblazer talent though
wow,not_removed,my ret paladin seems to be in a pretty good spot nothing super overpowered but nothing extremely bad im not enjoying being at the mercy of mages again spellsteal negates a majority of my ability to gap close and even stay alive having to macro a cancelaura for blessing of freedom feels really bad previously it didnt matter much if it was spell stolen because i didnt have a slow anyways now ive got a long cd slow so i cant risk it being removed even so it doesnt particular matter most times im glad they tuned holy wrath better because i really didnt like it but it was too op not to take by most standards now i dont have to use it our holy power talent that deals damage and heals should probably be looked at its a little clunky at times and not always good but when the stars align its a very polarizing ability i can basically swap my low hp percentage for my opponents full hp sometimes abilities that feel bad or feel op depending on set upluck probably arent healthy for any spec i do wish theyd add a glyph to make divine steed a normal sprint the charger thing is cool visually but if you play the class enough the sudden camera shift when you mount gets really annoying
wow,not_removed,port warrior and guardian druid still a lot stronger than the other tanks needs attention quickly but im afraid the damage is already done
wow,not_removed,as a destro lock all i can say is fy blizzard i want my single target dmg
wow,not_removed,a buff to bloodthirst self healing and single target damage and ill actually accept fury as being in an ok state i dont agree with the increased damage taken but if we heal ourselves significantly more i could almost see it as being flavour instead of pure shit if we deal better with constant damage but worse with burst that could be seen as a trade off our aoe damage is great but we really have to spec into it wrecking ball and out of a good single target damage buff avatar fury can function very well high into m but i really want to see a bit more single target damage on bosses its fun as heck just needs some numbers edit sorry didnt realise thread was about pvp ill leave my comment here still though as some applies my comment on bloodthirst still rings true in my mind a bit more self healing would be much better and lead us into respecting this class fantasy idea a bit more
wow,not_removed,frost mage damage outa no where kinda great
wow,not_removed,ww monk here im still an absolute monster in pvp usually can without much issue nothing better than laying down a fof right on a bg node while it stuns and does huge damage
wow,not_removed,frost dk can definitely hit like a truck now pair it with someone who can lockdown a target and youll have fun
wow,not_removed,havoc dh are pretty solid in m due to low cd burst aoe in raid we are below average due to poor st damage until you finally get the halfgiant lagendary ring no more ressource starving makes the class really fun to play and very competitive as a ilvl dh without the ring and two terrible legendaries im upset about not having it i tried it on my best friend ilvl dh and the gameplay is much smoother
wow,not_removed,every single class was buffed but my class my class was the only class nerfed everyone
wow,not_removed,hey im one of the people who didnt switch back to frost death knight unholy in its current state feels absolutely fantastic were not amazing but were not terrible but goddamn our aoe is ridiculous im currently putting out dps at ilvl and im pretty much always within range on dps charts in raid plus we actually have a fun little thing to do to get our hidden appearance unlike every other hidden appearance where its just a fucking drop yet we still dont know where frost dk is at the given moment so well see
wow,not_removed,world pvp as destro is pretty fun i take shit from nobody thanks to pve raid gear i pump out damage chaos bolts with haste those ffa quests have never been fun like now
wow,not_removed,elemental is still dogpoo p
wow,not_removed,frost dk feels super good o
wow,not_removed,i main unholy which is stagnating hard its dps is either really good or really shit and i dislike that aspect wheres it so reliant on procs tried going frost was immediately doing much better dps and i can do it consistently after its recent buff outside of my own class ive noticed that some classes are just really crap while others are able to just wreck everyone else in their role with little effort i do think balance is one of the main flaws of legion atm
wow,not_removed,i really hate my arcane mage now oom every seconds is annoying and i have zero dps increase because of the changes thanks blizzard
wow,not_removed,my friend played a rogue and is so salty about their nerfs since he made the alt just for pvp havent played against any since the first day of so i dont really know just how weak they are now i main a holy paladin in pvp and it feels mixed but very manageable feels like we dont have a lot of cc and healing mobility compared to other classes but something has to give our healing cds are quite strong and our utility feels great in battlegrounds avenging crusader feels nuts entire fights are totally one sided most times from that ability and a good beacon
wow,not_removed,my outlaw rogue feels pretty underpowered right now im and i know the class pretty well when i burst it seems like i only take off of an enemy players health some healing classes seem way overpowered mistweaver monks and blood dks seem unkillable im not sure why they cant balance pvp in rated battlegrounds the game has been out for years
wow,not_removed,im finding that disc priest are still struggling with high ranking m and heroic raiding i feel that the same issue that we dont have options in our rotation and talents im having fun though expect for the part im always on sub for raiding
wow,not_removed,arms warrior is still solid not top tier not bottom tier still better than fury
wow,not_removed,hunters do you even see any
wow,not_removed,at least they fixed our mastery so it procs off pet auto attacks substantial boost
wow,not_removed,how do you find your dps my ilevel is about in mythics i am pulling about and in raids about i am almost embarrassed to join raids as i dont want to get ridiculed for my deeps
wow,not_removed,if you barely use mongoose bite you gotta rethink your rotation
wow,not_removed,please blizz give vengeance more mitigation take away some of the healing soloing trivial content is not what we want to do
wow,not_removed,in bgs ive been getting nearly by sneaky destro locks it probably doesnt work in arenas well though chaos bolts from behind you in the bushes will do you in quick
wow,not_removed,he said pvp people have been qqing about destro for this patch in arenas destro has a very noticeable burst i dont play destro so i dont really have a say in whay they do and dont do though
wow,not_removed,yeah bloodthirst needs to give more hp maybe a flat amount based on the damage it deals or an increase to of max health would be nice
wow,not_removed,frost and unholy still need a lot of work they still lack sustained damage and scaling is always going to be an issue
wow,not_removed,yea frost dk is awesome now crazy sustained cleave and pretty good st burst now been playing frost nearly since the start and loving it even more now
wow,not_removed,what classspec do you play just out of curiosity
wow,not_removed,ua is mostly used to burn the healers mana so theyre easy to win against in since they lack pressure there however
wow,not_removed,dps on aoe
wow,not_removed,yes like everytime
wow,not_removed,oh didnt know that yet thats great d still that mongoose mechanic needs fixing to make us good
wow,not_removed,im around and i do about k dps in mythicsnormal so far and i think its ridiculously low with my bm that i barely invested in and dont got a relic slot i can do as much on bosses as survival i keep being stubborn and play survival though because its a really fun spec
wow,not_removed,does that make kosumoth the hungering trivial
wow,not_removed,yeah in bgs i can get chaos bolts off all the time but in arenas im lucky if i can cast anything it is an honor talent that allows us to hit that high with chaos bolts though so we dont necessarily have to put all our eggs in the chaos bolt basket lol
wow,not_removed,scaling you mean hotfixes every tier right
wow,not_removed,its great to have not changed my rotation at all and easily be pulling like difference
wow,not_removed,hes suggesting that this is the common philosophy that everyone follows regarding pvp balance that everyone else is strong or getting buffs except your own class
wow,not_removed,bm hunter dont give a rip about pvp or hard core progression in pve aka dirty casual im usually disappointed in the bm hunter pve rankings but i dont go into the fetal position over it yes my comment was to point out the general whoaismyclass crying that goes on all of the time
wow,not_removed,nope mostly single target
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,world content is trivial even if it cant be soloed compared to high level m and mythic raids its relatively simple
wow,not_removed,according to the official class forums every class is the worst class its kind of amusing
wow,not_removed,its clear what hes suggesting i was just hoping there was some irony in his comment if for example say he was a fire mage
wow,not_removed,whats wrong with that english is not my native language so if you got any comments about it i rather have that you tell me then just pick out a mistake
wow,not_removed,i heard someone here on reddit actually complain that outlaw is pure garbage compared to assassin or subtlety single target a bit less dps than the other specs for heavy cleaves outlaw rules supreme baby
wow,not_removed,well from a pvp point of view fire mages had a very brief surge in pvp popularity but arent that great now so are probably a viable qqsubject theres your irony d
wow,not_removed,first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth our language can be a total fuckery and youre doing great
wow,not_removed,i thought it was funny and i would have never guessed english is not your native language based on the rest of your post my bad
wow,not_removed,why would you look at it from a pvp point of view theyre literally topping the charts in pve content i also wouldnt call it a brief surge have you rolled a mage and gone to their order hall lately
wow,not_removed,thank you for the kind reply and explanation kinda confusing that the first are different but at least i know now many thanks
wow,not_removed,no problem then and i do my best to so thank you
wow,not_removed,because the op is looking at it from a pvp point of view reread his post
wow,not_removed,nope gotta get the tomes
wow,not_removed,that is so completely fucking stupid
wow,not_removed,would be extremely easy to get them all otherwise tho p
wow,not_removed,yeah but i spent years collecting all of these now i have to do it all over again thats just a kick in the dick by blizzard to enchanters like i understand the tomes of illusions for nonenchanters and having people go out and collect them if they havent learned the recipes already but to make enchanters who have collected all this stuff go out and do it all over again fuck man enchanting was already hurting as it is on my server at least we couldve actually made money off of our hard work collecting all of this stuff
wow,not_removed,as another long time enchanter while i originally agreed with your sentiment that this was a kick in the dick by blizzard i quickly realized that the ultimate fu back was that having to buy all of these cosmetic illusions was barely a drop in the bucket of what i made off enchanting the past decade plus
wow,not_removed,its really not that bad as an enchanter you can get most of the mats for the tomes of illusion much easier than a nonenchanter i have an enchanter thats been enchanting since with pretty much every old school recipe yet i went out gathered mats for all of the tomes in short order made them and learned them at a small cost of a little bit of time are you really complaining about this
wow,not_removed,its not a little bit of time and if i were to buy the mats on my server itd be thousands of gold since all of the mats are incredibly inflated due to these tomes of illusions as an enchanter you can get most of the mats for the tomes of illusion much easier than a nonenchanter also this isnt true for anything besides shards andor essences you might need everything else takes a hefty amount of time to farm out and thats not including the illusion tomes themselves which only have a chance to drop off specific bosses on a weekly lockout pissed off more by the principle of it since armors and weapons that youve found in the past have been unlocked why cant all of my weapon enchants be unlocked as well ive already collected them just like the armors that i have collected so yeah buddy im complaining about it and from where i stand its a pretty legit complaint
wow,not_removed,which tome patterns are on a drop i learned all from my trainer or gotten off vendor except the quest reward one from therazane in deepholm
wow,not_removed,its not a legit complaint youre blowing it out of proportion and saying things like completely fucking stupid and kick in the dick about something very minor at best
wow,not_removed,so you think it would be less mats to go back and individually enchant weapons with all these old enchants to unlock them one by one im not going to add them all up but i suspect thats quite a lot of mats maybe not the same mats as the tomes but still work to acquire them i dont see how your argument is even valid either way you need a bunch of mats we still have to go back and collect transmog gear from raids and dungeons things on lockouts for days ive been running some of the same ones for several years off and on and not seen certain items i want if we want a crafted items appearance we still have to gather the mats for them and make it
wow,not_removed,theres a whole bunch more that are not crafted by enchanting mongoose sunfire and soulfrost are all boss drops in karazhan for instance
wow,not_removed,most are drops from bosses you can check them out in the collections tab
wow,not_removed,its a legitimate complaint about something that shouldve been given to enchanters upon implementation of this thing how the fuck is saying its stupid and a kick in the dick blowing it out of proportion im not saying the game is utter shit and should be torn down because i am inconvenienced thats blowing it out of proportion i just happen to think that this is dumb and to me it feels like a kick in the dick that theyre making enchanters do this
wow,not_removed,there are certain enchantments that i would like to have again on transmogs that i am unable to use now because i am gated behind a drop chance and a lockout even though i was able to create illusions of them just a couple weeks ago i would like to use the shit that i spent years unlocking thats all but i cant do that now and i think thats crap considering i can do the real enchantment on items already
wow,not_removed,its not bad because theres something worse this guy killed people but hitler killed so hes innocent your logic in a nutshell
wow,not_removed,lol youre fucking retarded dude talk about blowing things way out of proportion
wow,not_removed,i hope everything that you wish for will never be granted for you so far one thing down
wow,not_removed,love you too babe
wow,not_removed,wut
wow,not_removed,dangit im so bad at reddit
wow,not_removed,no one wants to help you troll this person on whatever server youre on
wow,not_removed,notice i didnt share that information i thought it was funny
wow,not_removed,just curious i dont see any bug
wow,not_removed,fix what a yellow recipe means that there is a chance it will fail to level up
wow,not_removed,works as intended
wow,not_removed,chances are it was either feuer frei or du hast best guess
wow,not_removed,just youtube rammstein would probably be easier
wow,not_removed,it was a smoother song
wow,not_removed,bleeding hollow isnt that bad i play on both factions and i usually see a good amount of people on
wow,not_removed,i should have said ive got ally chars on that server almost full
wow,not_removed,zuljin is like horde and high pop
wow,not_removed,thank you for your submission blochtheguy it has been removed from rwow because loot achievement mount posts belong in the please post it there and dont forget your screenshot this includes posts of getting a terrible legendary hitting and a legendary immediately predicting a legendary getting two legendaries in a row etc this is not an automated removal please read the entire removal reason before contacting us via modmail for if you need clarification read the full httpswwwredditcomrwowwikirules if you feel this post was removed in error please
wow,not_removed,im going to say that they are brown because some official merchandise involving him appears to be brown such as his and a most importantly in game he appears to also have if anyone disagrees with your colour choice you could say you are doing the ingame version this type of thing happens in cosplay frequently ex manga vs anime versioncomic vs movie version etc
wow,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvibhlbimrq burning crusade cinematic look at whatever color you would call that p
wow,not_removed,httpmediablizzardcomwowmediawallpapersotherlegionlegionlargejpg
wow,not_removed,pretty sure theyre dark brown
wow,not_removed,theyre black
wow,not_removed,yeah i saw that strangly enough though after looking at all the pictures i have to say they look better as a dark grey or black thank you
wow,not_removed,world of warcraft illidan stormrage deluxe collector figure canada party new canada party new canada party new day httpiimgurcomzaizryppng httpwwwredditcomrpricezombiewikiindex
wow,not_removed,yeah i think im just going to go with a dark brown its a pattern for a hat with illidan horns ill just add a note i used xcolor but you can use any that you like thanks for the help i miss bc now
wow,not_removed,yeah thats the picture i keep eyeballing i cant tell if they are black or grey in that picture or if the green lighting is messing up the coloring i looked at a screenshot of the bt version and they look brownish to me i asked my husband and he said they look grey to him
wow,not_removed,i really think they are too but the newer pics of him make them look black
wow,not_removed,i think its just the lighting
wow,not_removed,well enjoy your whining as thats pretty much the only reason you did this post
wow,not_removed,im not sure what the point of this thread is were you expecting us to beg you to not go
wow,not_removed,let me know if you find an mmo that panders to babies so i know where to send people to when they want to quit like you
wow,not_removed,k bye
wow,not_removed,lol bye
wow,not_removed,rnowow
wow,not_removed,one less person complaining in the community byeee
wow,not_removed,no please dont go the community will be lost without your insight
wow,not_removed,the only thing i can relate to is the awful legendary system i actually do want to roll an elemental shaman over my rogue just because how good ele are in m
wow,not_removed,first of all why are you allways using of instead of have would of happend second you arent forced to use socket rings or legendarys and the necklace is pretty good for many specs perhaps its not the legendary thats wrong but you how one can think warlocks or shamans are badno idea perhaps skill would be more needed than items third no flying upon without some workyeah why do we have to raid for gear or do pvp for pvp loot why not just stand in goldshire opening chests with all those achivements mounts pets armor weapons whatnot game would be much quicker afterwards we go beat sargeras with our bare hands because he only gets hp and no attacks that would be so much quicker than actually having to work for things but i wanted to fly omg dont let the door hit you on the way out
wow,not_removed,welp bye dont let the door hit you on the way out
wow,not_removed,noo please dont leave make a tank
wow,not_removed,omg so funny its the rehab sub for wow lol
wow,not_removed,i love my monk but im not a huge fan of playing a panda since theyre just to goofy and cartoonish
wow,not_removed,mm hunters were already in a good spot before
wow,not_removed,i dont think they got nerfed and i main a mm hunter
wow,not_removed,realllly good spot s
wow,not_removed,not really they were bottommid
wow,not_removed,its not about what you think this was a direct nerf no question about it
wow,not_removed,fuck you man get in line fire has been dealing with this shit this entire tier sure hunters were slightly worse at the very beginning but blizzard fixed that within a week and you were back to the middle of the pack fire has legitimately been the bottom specs all tier long blizz constantly drones on about fires aoe but we have warlocks and other specs with lower ilvls doing the same and even more aoe damage and certainly doing higher st damage they need to stop going by the doubles standards and just fix every spec thats lacking period
wow,not_removed,now compare that to
wow,not_removed,is middle a bad spot
wow,not_removed,just look at pre and post and look how high mm went up
wow,not_removed,mm was middle of the pack during en i will give you that bm and mm have been bottom since tov and now frost is top tier
wow,not_removed,the statistics will not reflect the nerfs due to the sheer amount of logs up on day
wow,not_removed,it show show buffed they were with the trait
wow,not_removed,okay and its bad that a pure dps class has a viable spec in the top before both mm and bm were bottom tier
wow,not_removed,just stop dont use the pure dps class so i should be top dps class excuse
wow,not_removed,no but the fact of the matter is both bm and mm yanno the ranged specs which people want were both bottom of the pack there is no reason for both ranged hunter specs to be bottom tier
wow,not_removed,except mm is not bottom with the trait that got nerfed
wow,not_removed,im done either youre completely incompetent or a troll
wow,not_removed,you cant say mm is bottom when it isnt
wow,not_removed,i miss old av when you had to do stuff and it would take hours to days such a great experience
wow,not_removed,the man pvp battlegrounds you mean alterac valley has a way of getting off the blocklist every time you logout just remember to put it back on and youre good
wow,not_removed,ashran
wow,not_removed,why did they make of these did either of them get good reviews holy shit this is so bad
wow,not_removed,old av battles lasted for days ashran is nothing when compared
wow,not_removed,lots of people loved alterac valley lots of people still love alterac valley and wish it was longer and more complicated
wow,not_removed,very much so this ashran was a nice call back but the whole group kinda moved together to very specific thingsav had like scout groups of or doing specific things at the same timesomething about it made it excitingespecially when you finally summon galvthen it got intense
wow,not_removed,what is complicated by being cced for seconds by people
wow,not_removed,do you know that there are actual quests in av or that you can summon a giant mob on your side
wow,not_removed,i know that man fights in a game where each person has multiple ccs is not fun im sure this game mode isnt very popular ive not even done much googling on its crappiness but im sure its there
wow,not_removed,the glory days of av are gone it used to be awesome doing the quests for resources and to get more npcs to fight for your side working on summoning the elementals warlocks would even summon you to the boss when your side finally got enough towers down to try for a kill
wow,not_removed,sounds like ashran
wow,not_removed,yeah thats great and all but it sounds like you are even agreeing it sucks ass now why havent they just removed it the game is literally bugged forcing you to play it lol
wow,not_removed,no one is forcing you to play anything you have the option to black list it so it doesnt pop and i dont think it sucks i still enjoy it av just isnt as great as it use to be if you hate av thats cool just black list it and then you dont have to play it
wow,not_removed,why havent they just removed it because obviously some people want to play it or no one would ever queue for it the game is literally bugged forcing you to play it lol no one is forcing you to play it you can blacklist battlegrounds
wow,not_removed,i have im stilling getting qed for it
wow,not_removed,i do blacklist them both i magically still play them no one ever queed for dominion and riot didnt give up on it for years doesnt mean its a good game mode
wow,not_removed,alterac valley has a way of getting off the blocklist every time you logout
wow,not_removed,disc or holy
wow,not_removed,why didnt you use imgur as your image uploader
wow,not_removed,youre a pariah
wow,not_removed,why use slimgur its shit
wow,not_removed,warrior c
wow,not_removed,why does that matter
wow,not_removed,lolwat
wow,not_removed,gorefiend theres your problem
wow,not_removed,people who use reddit simplifiers because the vanilla reddit is way too complex get issues with other uploaders than imgur
wow,not_removed,of course how much of an idiot do you have to be to use an inferior image host because of your edginess
wow,not_removed,im pretty sure hes on eredar
wow,not_removed,ironic
wow,not_removed,how did you know
wow,not_removed,i know the people in that picture wardev
wow,not_removed,raticate
wow,not_removed,damn i knew it was one of the warriors
wow,not_removed,all current pvp vendors will still be available in legion marks of honor will continue to drop but will only be used as currency for prelegion gear
wow,not_removed,all the old pvp vendors are still on old spots only items that require rating like the elite set and tabard are removed
wow,not_removed,thanks i wasnt sure if i would miss out on a bunch of stuff if i didnt go ham farming bgs before legion
wow,not_removed,immediately
wow,not_removed,for you immediately for anyone else about days i think
wow,not_removed,it should be instant a friend and i were trying to come up with a name for my character and she was creating new toons to test if the name was available when i found a name i liked she deleted the character and i took the name
wow,not_removed,well thats odd are names realm specific cuz i tried using the name on another toon and it wasnt available
wow,not_removed,yes names are realm specific
wow,not_removed,i thought the raids in wod were sufficiently difficult did the raids seem really easy to you
wow,not_removed,mythic archimonde killed him heroic game is too easy
wow,not_removed,mop and wod raiding had some of the most complex and difficult encounters looking at the raid testing expect more of the same a lot more personal responsibility during fights if you tunnel your action bars youre dead if you cant watch dbmbigwigs timers youre dead its not like vanilla when bosses had real mechanics and you were watiing for the boss to get stacks of sunder armor
wow,not_removed,you really didnt think this post through did you
wow,not_removed,did you pay any attention to this sub before posting theres still people struggling with mythic hfc
wow,not_removed,i think you were looking for the phrase more accessible
wow,not_removed,wod has four difficulty levels from the very easy to the very hard legion will have the same you should have no trouble finding something to challenge you
wow,not_removed,im sure raiding will be easier in legion they are simplifying things quite a bit tanking and healing are both being simplified skills are being pruned so there arent quite as many buttons to press im sure all of this will come together to create a more accessible raid experience
wow,not_removed,he hasnt played in years so he has no idea what hes talking about
wow,not_removed,hes a very good dog
wow,not_removed,wow confirmed better game than breath of the wild
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,he is a v e r y g o o d b o y e and he very much deserves the pats heres the background on why hes such a good dog give him the pats now
wow,not_removed,i guess this wasnt common knowledge theres loads of animals of several varities that you can pet in valsharah check inside the buildings in bradenbrook and lorlathil puppies kittens some deers lots of cute little animals
wow,not_removed,i heard that he is a very good boy can anyone confirm this
wow,not_removed,fun fact this npc is a memorial of sorts to an irl dog named goya that passed away a few months ago she was the dog of iseisilva a wow roleplayer and popular artist heres her tumblr iseisilvatumblrcom
wow,not_removed,theres a hidden feats of strength achievement if you pet him times in a row fyi
wow,not_removed,very good boy
wow,not_removed,you can also get a reskinned corgi as a battle pet from one of your class hall missions im a hunter and the mission was called its so fluffy dogs name is corgnelius
wow,not_removed,wait where is the innkeeper been looking all over the place
wow,not_removed,all the buildings in bradensbrook valsharah have animals you can pet corgis pugs and cats
wow,not_removed,i like to pet the kitty cats in valsharah by those crazy farmers
wow,not_removed,theres also a cat you can pet in one of the buildings in bradensbrook cat remember which building though it was really relaxing after a hard day of murdering everything in sight to be able to relax with a feline friend
wow,not_removed,its a shame the mop farm dog doesnt show up elsewhere
wow,not_removed,better avoid him dont want my demon kitten getting upset
wow,not_removed,now that theyve put a nice dog in the inn could they finish it and make it a rest area with insta log out

wow,not_removed,he looks like a very good boy
wow,not_removed,fun detected incoming nerf
wow,not_removed,he also drags his ass like he has worms
wow,not_removed,can confirm goya to be a very very good boy
wow,not_removed,hes a good boy dog
wow,not_removed,this is why i hate reddit yesterday there was a post saying that dog is a very good dognext day there is a post about this dog with top comment he is a very good dog
wow,not_removed,hay doggie
wow,not_removed,omg a dog caps lock is permitted for these kind of posts
wow,not_removed,thanks for wasting my time why are of posts in rwow never actually anything important
wow,not_removed,please go the fuck outside already
wow,not_removed,expected some rundertale is leaking
wow,not_removed,theyre good dogs brent
wow,not_removed,you can pet dogs if you unequip your weapons
wow,not_removed,in twilight princess you could pick up cats
wow,not_removed,the durability system is certainly more thought out
wow,not_removed,aw man i had no idea why everyone was so thrilled about this specific dog i didnt plan on crying at
wow,not_removed,whoever is cutting onions better stop because its too early in the morning for this shit
wow,not_removed,man i didnt plan on a dusty environment today
wow,not_removed,dammit now i am crying at work i lost my best friend to cancer last year after surgeries and a round of chemo she was a beagle we called molly bear i have my hunter parked in grizzly hills in hopes to some day tame the ghost bear so she can always be with me
wow,not_removed,well im now cryin on the fully crowded bus
wow,not_removed,why is it raining on my face again
wow,not_removed,sleep tight pupper
wow,not_removed,i petted the cats in bradensbrook yesterday and just lost it it was the first time i tried and they yawn and stretch when you do it
wow,not_removed,yeah i was just clicking on some of them for a good solid minute or two one day when i found one on a bed that i could interact with
wow,not_removed,g o o d b o y e
wow,not_removed,the dog passed away or the artist
wow,not_removed,say what you will about blizzard but they always put in some reference to the comunity in every expansion
wow,not_removed,also you get a mew
wow,not_removed,read this pet him times in a row realized this guy is a super troll subsequently punched myself in the face
wow,not_removed,i cant believe youve done this
wow,not_removed,my gf is super jealous because she hasnt gotten him yet
wow,not_removed,by the dog
wow,not_removed,turn on innkeeper tracking on your minimap
wow,not_removed,and succulent lamb
wow,not_removed,it makes a splendid return to your wod garrison actually
wow,not_removed,meh they fixed it on pvp realms deliverance point should now have a rest area
wow,not_removed,my exact reason for posting
wow,not_removed,lmao i wonder how many people on this sub will actually get this without googling it
wow,not_removed,i think all of the dogs do that
wow,not_removed,theyre good dogs bront
wow,not_removed,this is like the post ive seen since tuesday yes its annoying but whatever people like their wholesome memes and the sub doesnt need to cater to you just downvote and move on
wow,not_removed,how dare you waste my time while i mindlessly browse reddit
wow,not_removed,so you saw the title which makes it very clear what this post was about and decided to come in here and waste your time relax theres plenty of posts on here about things related to patch notes or class fantasy or lore or class roles but hey i guess none of those things are important to the game also reddit probably isnt your best choice if you dont want memes and silliness
wow,not_removed,went the fuck outside as instructed immediately ran into yet another very good dog available for petting theyre everywhere suggest you remain firmly ensconced in your parents basement eating cheetos in your skidmarked tighty whities illuminated by the light of your righteous reddit posts while we assess the threat hail hydra
wow,not_removed,are you ok
wow,not_removed,blatant reuse of old meme would still pet though
wow,not_removed,ok bront
wow,not_removed,you can technically pet them with your weapons too outcome may be less than satisfactory
wow,not_removed,cats can swim also
wow,not_removed,you mean the durability system that only serves to act as a minor gold sink for raiders botws equipment system is actually pretty great if a little frustrating at times
wow,not_removed,dammit now i am crying at home i lost my best doggo to getting sick from eating too much a couple years back she was a shiba inu i called ash also yes this is purposefully copying the above text
wow,not_removed,weird that it should be raining inside the bus
wow,not_removed,well crap i know what ill be spending my game time on tonight
wow,not_removed,oh
wow,not_removed,the fucks wrong with you
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,no
wow,not_removed,real quick
wow,not_removed,youre all types of fucked up you should probably see a therapist for your problems
wow,not_removed,the dog
wow,not_removed,hidden under the truck
wow,not_removed,missingno will spawn in certain places on the broken shore
wow,not_removed,well you actually need to pet him a hundred times with a hidden appearance
wow,not_removed,same hereomg
wow,not_removed,nope it works if you do them too fast it doesnt count and if you wait too long itll reset kinda buggy at the moment theyre busy fixing elisande tho so itll be a bit before they can fix this
wow,not_removed,i think you can buy one from the ah go get that doggo
wow,not_removed,and i pet him every day on every alt i had i was so excited to see him there i wonder if hes poking around the isles somewhere too
wow,not_removed,immediately ran into yet another very good dog available for petting what kind of dog the internet needs to know
wow,not_removed,oh you shouldnt have went through the effort just for me im sure you felt better petting the virtual one hail hydra
wow,not_removed,a virtual dog you can pet is being listed and upvoted as very important in this subreddit must be me that is unwell
wow,not_removed,its matter of opinion but the system is clearly flawed in several ways you need to constantly go into menus to drop bowsshields and some weapons so you can grab upgrades as enemy hp ramp up their weapons fail to keep pace so ultimately eachcombat is at a loss enviromental kills exploding barrels etc become less effective as the enemy hp increase as well the end result is players avoiding combatit is simply not worth the loss of equipment the mastersword breaks then has to recharge it cant recharge until it breaks this leads to players using it to minechop down trees to trigger the recharge who thought this was a good idea a common thing i hear is if the mastersword didnt break youd use it all the time of course i would its the fucking master sword i earned it by questing i have hours into the game at this point i like it but its clear the durability system has some flaws that could have been flagged by some qa testing
wow,not_removed,i have a red shiba named foxy
wow,not_removed,you want to raid tonight ive got amnimals to pet yo
wow,not_removed,yeah
wow,not_removed,theyre good dogs brent
wow,not_removed,it was a good dog
wow,not_removed,you should rephrase your comment then
wow,not_removed,you should rephrase your comment then
wow,not_removed,the hover tooltip on the hidden appearance is even tracking this for you now no mods required
wow,not_removed,rip my pocketbook i just got the grand expedition yak for her last week
wow,not_removed,the wow pets website says corgnelius is going for obscene amounts of gold on my server but ive had no luck selling him so far
wow,not_removed,a very good one
wow,not_removed,fun detected
wow,not_removed,i mean youre angrily insisting people have no lives because of a joke yes it is you
wow,not_removed,its a cute and silly addition to the game people like little things like this
wow,not_removed,well you are on a subreddit dedicated to the game so i think its relevant its like news stories about cute animals i think its you that needs to go outside
wow,not_removed,the very important part is very obviously a joke something tells me you dont get along with real people very much which makes it hilarious you tell others to go outside
wow,not_removed,agreed like i said its still frustrating at times but i personally wasnt bothered all that much by some of the more minor issues i ended up having a stockpile of royal broadswords towards the end so i never really had to worry about the net loss you mentioned yeah the ms kinda sucks in that regard which is funny because the damage isnt even that good they couldve made it unbreakable but kept it at mediocre damage and just had it as backup weapon for when your other shit breaks but oh well
wow,not_removed,as enemy hp ramp up their weapons fail to keep pace so ultimately eachcombat is at a loss enviromental kills exploding barrels etc become less effective as the enemy hp increase as well the end result is players avoiding combatit is simply not worth the loss of equipment weapons do keep up later tier weapons have more durability by default and get special stats like increased durability the only fights that could be considered a loss are the ones against guardians if you use a standard weapon but you shouldnt do that anyway and even if a weapon breaks you find so many weapons that it doesnt even matter
wow,not_removed,hmm i feel like we have different experiences with the point i often have more equipment than im capable of carrying but i do use bows and urbosas fury somewhat regularly though if youre referring to the break rate vs find rate of only melee weapons then i see what you mean
wow,not_removed,im about hours in and until you commented on it i didnt really think about how every fight is a loss i guess it is though i tend to raid hyrule castle from time to time and just pick up equipment tossed on the ground in various rooms as the stuff in there is better than of what you find elsewhere
wow,not_removed,there just for you
wow,not_removed,do you use an ah addon maybe it can help you
wow,not_removed,o
wow,not_removed,he has an irrational fearhatred of cute and fluffy things like a dog that is a very good boy yes he is
wow,not_removed,hes right about the silly amount of time spent in menus towards the end of the game though even if the weapons were indestructible swapping out pieces of armor for cold resistance swim speed climb speed stealth etc gets really clunky
wow,not_removed,helmetbackayalas ringwristswaist is a good start to a list any legendary is at least alright for fury though youre totally fine using that one sucks that it doesnt have haste of course but the mastery is crazy put mark of the hidden satyr and a hastestrength gem into it and youll be golden
wow,not_removed,its not the best but its very good for mitigating damage and staying alive you cant dps if youre dead
wow,not_removed,for fury the best would be the ring helm and back the others are pretty meh and most of the time wont even get used until they get buffed atleast
wow,not_removed,some people reported it fucking up your swing timer when the shield is applied like you stop auto attacking altogether for seconds before the normal swing timer resumes be wary about it if youre doing content which may cause it to be applied on a regular basis it may fuck up your rage generation slightly
wow,not_removed,yeah it replaced an neck so its obviously a huge upgrade plus made my mastery go up like and popped me up ilvls so im happy for now just hope i can get the head or the back next time to really up my damage
wow,not_removed,thats the fountain before lich king was killed statues are probably just bugged
wow,not_removed,still has the whole entire cutscene enshrined tyrion no one one must know what happened here today cmonnnnnnn guise bolvar
wow,not_removed,was like that last i was on the ptr i had preicc flashbacks
wow,not_removed,this is a bug indeed
wow,not_removed,seriously bolvar had like one request to be forgotten and here tirion goes and screws it all up maybe getting killed in broken isles was his karma coming back to haunt him
wow,not_removed,i actually havethat is my main character and i didnt play during wrath of the lich kingi started at pandariaso i didnt know that there was that fountain on there before
wow,not_removed,all three are really close outlawassassination are the preference currently
wow,not_removed,assassination is the most fun for me but i would recommend putting some points into your outlaw artifact for aoe
wow,not_removed,come into the shadows where us rogues belong go subtlety especially if you like to pvp or if you want to be nightcrawler attacking and stunning everything through the shadows its not gonna top the charts but its gonna be competitive for now with the other specs and should out scale them for the top spot in the months to come
wow,not_removed,thanks
wow,not_removed,ass is always nice
wow,not_removed,so should i level as outlaw and switch to assassination at
wow,not_removed,outlawassassination i heard outlaw might be nerfed with new patch
wow,not_removed,i kinda wish they had a better looking artifact power
wow,not_removed,yeah assassination aoe sucks but i think it had better single target even before the hotfixes
wow,not_removed,yea its not that impressive youre right i wish there was something more to it that added to the play style in saying that its really strong burst dps wise and provides a slow but the min cooldown is pretty lackluster as well however our artifact provides other passives that are head and shoulders above the other in my opinion pretty high passive dodge chance no fall damage and able to vanish from using sprint
wow,not_removed,ok thanks for the info
wow,not_removed,hmm
wow,not_removed,hmm
wow,not_removed,fishing for creditsdisappointed in you
wow,not_removed,hardly given you lot of info there and personally when anyone helps me a give them for there effort even if its as simple as linking me to a yt vid but whatever ill take my info elsewhere
wow,not_removed,fine ill give you your damn crybaby
wow,not_removed,tn was my server since late bc it used to be high pop but i feel its really fallen apart maybe i just dont really like the low population server feel but that place feels pretty dead unfortunately i wouldnt suggest anyone to move there maybe ravenholdt is better but based on the amount of chat i was seeing it seems that ravenholdt dwarfs the population and activity of tn
wow,not_removed,i played on ravenholdt for years it was a great server
wow,not_removed,well it is pretty empty but there are people that play on it and the people there all really like the rural feel it has before i moved to ravenholdt a month ago i was on emerald dream and it didnt feel like much of a closeknit community a bunch of zerg guilds tons of trolls and memes in chat and wasnt a very nice community it was however much more active and there were always people everywhere it felt like how a city would feel and a lot of people do prefer cities over a rural lifestyle while you say you wouldnt suggest it and i would agree but if someone is looking for a very close tightknit communityravenholdt and twisting nether both fit that it also is on its own database so it wont be merged ever with emerald dream which many that reside on ravenholdt and twisting nether see as a plus because of the server location itll always be kind of off on its own with a smaller community just a different kind of server style is all if you want a very active server a medium to high pop server obviously fits a lot better if you want a closeknit again smaller population server where it doesnt feel so crowded i find ravenholdt and twisting nether fit it perfectly with that said dont go in expecting high end raiding that is definitely a negative for many i have a raid group that is offserver and it works okay but a server like emerald dream is far easier to get a raid group and most of the raid guilds do far more than ravenholdt and twisting nether again just fits a different playstyle is all
wow,not_removed,plus itll be nice to be able to play a demon hunter without dealing with the horde of crowds that will look like a florida miami beach in the summer p i imagine a lot may end up hopping on the server just for that no matter how briefly but maybe some will stick around
wow,not_removed,and then you get haste versatility on every piece and no piece is above feelsbatman
wow,not_removed,hah ended up this way for my warrior had like pieces waiting for me
wow,not_removed,where are these from
wow,not_removed,i feel you i did kind of the same thing with my shaman i grinded ashran and went from a fresh to httpiimgurcombmdnlgujpg nothing feels better than getting a giant boost when you hit
wow,not_removed,im a returning player is grinding ashran similar to the wintergrasp of yore
wow,not_removed,kind of if you queue individually it can be a bit painful what i did when i hit is joined an ashran premade under the pvp ashran tab you want to look for their names hydra if youre horde and avengers if youre alliance what they do is have large man premades do objectives and quests relevant in ashran for easy honour valor im on my phone right now but if you google ashran hydra or ashran avengers it should direct you to the relevant vent information you need a password to get in so vent is basically required though you dont need to talkjust ask for the password
wow,not_removed,engaging gameplay
wow,not_removed,pack
wow,not_removed,being dismounted while just quickly passing through is my personal number one inconvenience in wow which usually is combined with being dazed
wow,not_removed,dont daze me bro
wow,not_removed,because they added a crafted by leatherworkers to help avoid it
wow,not_removed,because youre not a tank
wow,not_removed,they came up with the mythic man content to bring back that old school human interaction and game world immersion through travel feeling thats also why we dont get flying in early expansion anymore the forum has been spammed endlessly with lfg killed wow since wrath because it took away human interaction and game world immersion the content isnt supposed to be difficult the content is supposed to engage you with the world and the community they arent backing down from that design goal
wow,not_removed,the reason heroics are easier now than they used to be is because you can queue for it my experience with randoms is you oftentimes get people who arent the brightest
wow,not_removed,im curious as to why they havent done this myself since they clearly use the data from mythics for their class balancing it would seem to be that for a better perspective of whats going on it would benefit them to enable it but i dunno man im just a guy on the internet with an opinion
wow,not_removed,your complaint is exactly why heroic dungeons have not been heroic in years also no id prefer to not get back into queuecraft
wow,not_removed,being declined from mythics im over geared for hours then giving up is increased human interaction
wow,not_removed,wiping on heroic odyn times i completely agree with you
wow,not_removed,you do know group finder is competely optional right always has been
wow,not_removed,if that is such a problem start a group yourself or even get a tankhealer friend
wow,not_removed,list your own group if you dont get in one right away every group that gets listed fills in minutes its very streamlined if you cant get a group going youre not bothering to try
wow,not_removed,shapes and colours man
wow,not_removed,you dont seem to understand that as soon as mythics get implemented into lfd people are going to complain and then its going to get nerfed and then blizzard is going to have to come up with another difficulty so no you couldnt be more wrong if you tried
wow,not_removed,just get a friend how but more importantly the content is easy and all its doing is making it harder to group for
wow,not_removed,yeah i seriously dont get this why is the op even complaining the lfg tool is exactly the same you just have to press a few extra buttons and they give you the control to select who you want freaking click lfg custom dungeon start group put ilvl or not put need tank healer and dps then do your stuff until people start requesting for invites how is that vastly different from queuing
wow,not_removed,it was the add that caused trouble mostly since i was the only one interrupting as the tank everyone else just ran around like headless chickens the runes definitely give some people problems too though
wow,not_removed,how join a guild communicate with people in pugs try to find people irl that play the content is easy and the ones who makes the groups can choose exactly who they want to bring you can do the same if you took the effort to create a group of your own
wow,not_removed,still need to find tanksheals guildies arent on or helpful all the time im just saying it might as well be something we can que for and have the group put together leave the mythic as is
wow,not_removed,just make your own group its way faster than trying to get invited and also as fast as joining lfg for heroics never waited more than minutes as dd
wow,not_removed,couldnt we have both options then
wow,not_removed,check your combatlog file it may be too big and you may need to delete it
wow,not_removed,have you double checked with another character of yours
wow,not_removed,is there someone in your raid who is logging you need an addon and need to upload the logs to the website it doesnt automatically add logs for every raid in the game
wow,not_removed,ok sorry to sound like a complete idiot but how do i check that
wow,not_removed,thats a good idea but i only have one character at thank you for suggestion though
wow,not_removed,i have the addon and had no problem uploading them before now it just says no fights were logged good question though
wow,not_removed,go your world of warcraft folder then go into the logs folder and delete wowcombatlog
wow,not_removed,ok thank you
wow,not_removed,shadowform is back to the way it was before cata though even worse casting it dismounts you you come back from dead without it eating certain foods will remove it unclear which it seems inconsistent certain toys will cancel it its dispellable this is just dumb why they didnt just reimplement shadowform as it was in and is beyond me they had finally got it right you came back from the dead and it was up there was almost no way to drop it accidentally it took them years but they fixed it then in they remove it and then in they bring it back using the alpha code from wow by the feel of it its broken and i think they have done it so they can say for see we gave you what you wanted and you all hate it what we wanted was shadowform as it was for the last years not this crap
wow,not_removed,i was honestly fine with just always being in shadowform
wow,not_removed,why the fuck were you people obsessed about shadowform anyway they made an excellent change in getting rid of it with your constant complaining made them bring that garbage ability back go fuck yourselves honestly
wow,not_removed,its dispellable is this for real thats fucking awful having to recast it on after death was understandable and a minor inconvenience i like my transmogs without shadowform so its worth it but losing it in combat has to be annoying as hell and can ruin you shit
wow,not_removed,people complained about not seeing their transmogs have a nice day s
wow,not_removed,jesus so its being removed in every way i suspected fuck that i like one guys idea on the forums in that the cosmetics of it should be fueled by insanity at insanity you are entirely visible and by insanity you are fully translucent they also got rid of my glyphs with the update
wow,not_removed,does that mean mages can spellsteal it
wow,not_removed,but my class fantasy
wow,not_removed,ive spent a couple hours farming for transmogs why should i be unable to see my transmogs ever on a specific spec
wow,not_removed,tbh having to recast it after death is not a minor inconvenience after having not had to do it for months
wow,not_removed,i cant see any other explanation i think only certain things can do it its not just everything that can get rid of it but i would occasionally get a while stunlocked of my time in combat so somethings turning it off i think its something to do with abilities that can remove shield interacting with the damage reduction or something update was having it purged off my last night met up with a friend on his shaman with me on my horde priest and purge was killing my shadowform
wow,not_removed,rip tree form
wow,not_removed,that is a really really good idea
wow,not_removed,demon form for locks you know this was removed cos its a demon hunter thing its not coming back
wow,not_removed,are you blind cause you can clearly see transmogs while in shadowform
wow,not_removed,lol a dk a frost dk
wow,not_removed,is laughable sorry
wow,not_removed,druids can buy a treeform shapeshift in moonglade among other things cosmetic doesnt even break polymorph but it still exists
wow,not_removed,i mean if your stat priority is wrong spriest actually do close to no damage you need haste before you can start doing decent damage but then you shoot past all the other dps
wow,not_removed,for the boss we are working on at my item level seems to be about the most people measure by their best because its all about the epeen i measure by what i am doing on what we are working on right now we are not a hardcore guild i only raid times a week if that and break often for work thats what i am doing on that fight i can live with it
wow,not_removed,it doesnt make you immune to polymorphs or give phat healing bonuses anymore
wow,not_removed,its act not cosmetic there is a trait in resto druids weapon that gives him passive hp regen while shapeshifted that works on treant form so for once its act useful
wow,not_removed,thats not true at all or more accurately haste is a soft breakpoint for insanity generation during surrender to madness you can absolutely do incredible damage without that much haste you just have to play better
wow,not_removed,thats what i said though
wow,not_removed,so for once its act useful from classic to cataclysm it used to be a quite strong healing buff compared to what other healers had back then not sure about what youre talking about
wow,not_removed,it got fixed already
wow,not_removed,oops my bad didnt know that started in wod
wow,not_removed,i kind of feel sorry for you
wow,not_removed,hahahah what the fuck
wow,not_removed,httpiimgurcomgoxfmtigifv
wow,not_removed,if you have the nightborn disguise from the suramar questline the best way to farm ancient mana is in suramar city most nodes give between ancient mana each i can get to the cap within a few minutes
wow,not_removed,best way is to take the portal to the vineyards and just run around looking for mana up until the menagerie smaller space than suramar city easier to navigate not a lot of guards
wow,not_removed,if you can kill the nighthuntress shes worth about if you stand in the circle she drops when she runs away
wow,not_removed,fishing in suramar with the underlight angler
wow,not_removed,use the boon of manaseeker shoulder chant the bag you get from kill can drop and ancient mana crystal some chanting mats i just do suramar wq and pick up the ancient mana nodes along the way
wow,not_removed,whatever you do get the buff from valtrois it makes lightning nodes spawn when you kill stuff that when you step in them generate ancient mana when you get the suramar questline done it gets significantly cheaper too
wow,not_removed,best way is to use the shoulder vz
wow,not_removed,u cud also connect all leylines for inc loot on mobs and ench should to drop mana tinged packs then just kill mobs in heavy pulls
wow,not_removed,double fortified arc wine
wow,not_removed,vineyards were nerfed afaik the nodes are now equally distributed throughout the city also there are no manainfused gems in the vineyards and those give the most mana in my experience
wow,not_removed,i do a loop at the vineyards and then drop down south while being really sneaky
wow,not_removed,the night huntress
wow,not_removed,fuck that though not worth the time nor hassle
wow,not_removed,not worth it stick to bloodhunter
wow,not_removed,the infused arcwine can give the most but its somewhat random ive gotten over from one of those gems seem to be more consistent and are definitely my second choice like others in this thread i like suramar city where the elites are but if thats too much of a pain the bazaar area where you collect arcwine for the wq is also a solid choice
wow,not_removed,definitely worse at least ive found the best place to be around the market where you start out now the gem spots can be tricky but you learn them pretty fast no big mean elites and lots of easy ways to get away if you get caught
wow,not_removed,an elite in suramar she wanders around suramar on a saber and does some pretty high damage when aggroed she pursues you around suramar if you try to run away but if you manage to kill her a leyline spot that gives a ton of mana will spawn
wow,not_removed,wandering elite in suramar that will wreck you if youre caught offguard and undergeared raid geared players may find her easily soloable but someone running around in questing blues will get destroyed she rides around on a manasaber and has a few common locations she roams near i found her to be a close call in h en gear if her pet joined in but a mixture of n and h nh gear she cant really dent my voidwalker
wow,not_removed,for a geared lock its pretty easy but yeah thats the if you can part my alts would get destroyed
wow,not_removed,here here i fell in love with legion fishing as soon as i saw the barrel traits we get ive been fishing in sarumar to level up my rod and it really doesnt take long to hit ancient mana as a byproduct of fishing
wow,not_removed,i typically pull as many mobs on the screen as i can find and focus one down and it pops a leyline feed and i just stand in it while i aoe the rest down i dont have to go out of my way really so its not worthless
wow,not_removed,well not to me but i do agree that its a matter of opinion and that paying for it is a bit too much
wow,not_removed,soloable will depend on the class a tank class in n nh gear probably could anyone else wont be able to take the damage
wow,not_removed,dh here soloed her but had to use meta like almost instantly she hits hard so unless you have some wicked self heals a healer or other dps is deff needed
wow,not_removed,if you really want to level up your pole quickly id suggest using having the other two lures in your bag will mean you only catch the rings and with a decent amount of points in your pole youll likely catch another one before the lure expires so you can permanently farm ap fish nonstop it does get a little boring and you dont catch anything else useful however
wow,not_removed,to tag onto this the leyline that pops up does aoe damage to enemies standing in it as well so pulling large packs and having it pop it really helpful for murdering half an areas worth of guards
wow,not_removed,my afflock can take her with ease and i remember downing her back when i was mid to high but i had to channel life funnel quite a bit to keep the poor purple guy alive shes not actually that bad i struggle to solo some of the rare elite wq sometimes more than her you can separate her from the manasaber and it heavily reduces the damage you have to deal with
wow,not_removed,im currently on level and ive done all of my pole so far in suramar just running along on the water near the farwest flightpath even if im barreling the entire pools every time theres always another pool for me to run through plus im seeing a tonne of those sleepy murlocs which at this point are dropping rare fish on each use
wow,not_removed,exactly any wq that requires kill x amount of x mob anywhere in the city limits is a no brainer because you can pull as many as you need and just aoe it
wow,not_removed,aff lock have a tank pet and significantly more self healing than most dps classes so they arent exactly representative of what you average dps class can solo
wow,not_removed,no they arent which is why i mentioned it but for other classes that may have the healing or other tools to get through her high burst healing etc or are just geared to the teeth its an option that or beg a healer to hunt her down with you but a tank class should have little to no issue on her
wow,not_removed,imo all the tanks feel pretty bad in regards of feeling like that immovable object playstyle now you feel like a tanky dps least i do as for the rankings id say best being top druid death knight demon hunter warrior paladin monk thats all playstyle wise numbers wise i have no clue
wow,not_removed,i havent gotten my prot war to max level yet but im having a lot of fun with her at the playstyle is a little different you want to be maintaining your barriers and other damage mitigation a bit more than before but ill pull two or three world mobs at once and come out at max health
wow,not_removed,ignore pain is broken
wow,not_removed,so let me say this play whatever you want that being said warriors have historically started the previous xpacs a little weaker than the other tanks historically their gear has always allowed them to shine later in the xpacs and i can understand why people are hesitant to play warriors prot warriors have been changed a lot and i am excited to see them when legion drops
wow,not_removed,ignore pain very powerful it alone makes them possibly the strongest tank it stacks ya loving prot warrior hope they dont nerf it but they probably will ignore pain is like a semispammable cooldown atm
wow,not_removed,so you experience pain like everybody else
wow,not_removed,the struggle of a prot warrior is all too real
wow,not_removed,remember back when warriors were the second worst tank in basically every metric and then they buffed druids so that warriors were the worst i can remember h blackhand just two shotting me dude you need to pop a cd for that oh yeah sorry let me just pop one of my cds that totally arent on cd from last time i like to believe that with the separation of pve and pvp scaling that theyll be able to balance shit on the fly now and keep most classes on par i want to believe
wow,not_removed,in vanilla only warriors tanked
wow,not_removed,ive seen many situations like that in which one person gets called out for playing badly and that same person initiates a kick against someone else other players simply assuming that someone is trying to kick the bad player blindly click yesvote to kick im guessing this is what happened to you the tank initiated a vote to kick you and the other players mindlessly clicked yes thinking you were initiating a vote kick against him
wow,not_removed,its a low level dungeon it really doesnt matter and if youre questioning if someone cares because of this experience then god help you
wow,not_removed,it sucks but sometimes you have to deal with assholes online some people take all criticism as shit talking some people will appreciate someone trying to be helpful its best to move on and just forget that someone was a dick we all run into that so thats probably why youre getting some jaded responses here
wow,not_removed,shit post
wow,not_removed,whats the minimum amount of experience that i need to be allowed to complain oh great one
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,you can complain to yourself no need to post it on the internet
wow,not_removed,you came to a rant post complaining about me complaining meta as fuck
wow,not_removed,rather than being all passive aggressive how about not telling someone how to play their class and just do your low level dungeons in silence like the rest of the comunity
wow,not_removed,helping out isnt a bad thing if he came off with a yo dude youre a shit tank use consecrate come on go gogogogo then id agree he deserves to be treated this way if he just said what he suggests in his post then this is a pretty shitty situation its now what the game should be like but thankfully most of the time it isnt honestly i dont think we should all just accept this as standard however we certainly dont need posts about every little slight
wow,not_removed,i asked him if there was a reason he wasnt using consecrate op was being a dick when got kicked
wow,not_removed,not really a dick move to ask someone that it could really be helpful if someone doesnt know like i said though if he worded it in a dickish way then thats a different story but the simple question itself doesnt turn him into a dick thats insane to suggest
wow,not_removed,any stranger randomly asking me something like that is going to come off poorly particularly from a tank perspective a whiney dps talking down to you isnt the first impression you want we are only hearing from the victoms side and he even stated that he was being awful
wow,not_removed,i pretty much strictly tank im no stranger to some of the shitty things dps say which is why i said that if the guy opened up with some bullshitthen he deserves to be kicked ive booted plenty of people for being assholes and dealt with some people just trying to ruin my day but if im messing up and someone calls me on it i shouldnt act salty about it and vote kick honestly its not wrong to ask someone to do something if it makes it easier for everyone its the way you ask that matters i can appreciate why it can be upsetting for some people but i also question if its really warranted for something as small as hey why arent you using consecration since i have no clue what op actually said though and since we have no logsits a bit of a fruitless point anyways if op is telling the truth though there is no reason he should have been kicked for all we know he made the comment more colorfully and then youre entirely correct
wow,not_removed,you know what we may not agree on this but as also a tank main i think youre good people and yes if it was worded well it would just be some salty bs if it was worded as described or worse i would have kicked too nice meeting you man
wow,not_removed,yeah opinions are always all over the place but same to you was nice talking
wow,not_removed,step be real lucky i got mine on my first max alchemists first canopic jar solve my main has had max level archeology since cata and has only opened a few jars i had to buy my crawly hand
wow,not_removed,hey peeps made this vid nearly a year ago and noticed the prices have actually sky rocketed for the mount recently on eu servers not sure about us ive seen average sales for and some going up to so if you have been wondering about the best way to get the recipe here you go yes you can get it through wod as well but i personally still stand by this method being better if you farm all the mats then it only really costs you a investment so if your selling it for thats a pretty nice profit but alas you need the recipe first and i wont lie its going to be a pain in the butt gl and happy mount making
wow,not_removed,i finally tried for this when i leveled archeology in wod i got it on the first urn i solved
wow,not_removed,thats rediculous man d took me ages but i was doing the original uldum stuff haha
wow,not_removed,most people go premade seems like an assertion lacking in support
wow,not_removed,well i know me and everyone in my circle of friends basically gave up on lfr after mop in mop it was the only way to get gear without stepping into an actual raid now wqs just throw gear at you like candy so whats the point of doing lfr when its when normal is just as faceroll and gives
wow,not_removed,i agree that lfr isnt appealing to many people but i dont think there is really data on how many people do it compared to group finder pugs or guild raids or none of the above or just quitting the game
wow,not_removed,ill hit you up just hit on a shaman and have a druid near
wow,not_removed,what is your goal what do you want rather than ask what should i do instead ask i want this and that how do i get to it
wow,not_removed,i hope blizzarx does not see this
wow,not_removed,level your followers and just stick to story quests after that do broken shore world quests any extra time do the emissary the problem i am at is that all my sorry quests are in raids atm
wow,not_removed,i hope i dont come across like a dick but i have an honest question how can you be overwhelmed these days everything is fairly obviously lined out and made clear in my oppinion im so interested in why you dont seem to find the info that you need
wow,not_removed,coming from another casual player i think hes more concerned with the amount of things tondo especially with multiple characters not necessarily not understanding how to do something if i only have an hour to play a day i have to decide how best to use my time which with everything available in the game can be a daunting task
wow,not_removed,this is exactly where i am coming from felinomancy mostly i am wanting to simply keep characters relevant so that i can do the new content upon release and do mythic whenever i get ready also and i guess mainly im looking for a priority list i have friends that do emissary broken shore farm lfr for every raid normalheroic for every raid and raid mythic on the weekends of all of the content currently available what is really a priority for staying relevant in the content
wow,not_removed,also i do want to play multiple characters i enjoy the game from many different vantage points but how do i do hours a day of content for characters
wow,not_removed,its very pretty but and take this with a grain of salt im not an artist or anything something about the scale just seems off thunder bluff seems much too small compared to the trees and the rest of the scene its a bit disorienting
wow,not_removed,beautiful
wow,not_removed,i wish tauren would switch to alliance so i could go to mulgore taruen was the first race i ever made back years ago at my cousions place loved mulgore then still love it now
wow,not_removed,remind me the first night i played wow when it was released played a tauren warrior and at some point after finishing the starter towns i could see thunder bluff in the distance and could not wait to go visit it ohhh yes tons of lag these the first few release days so i didnt get to go there my first day of playing
wow,not_removed,just needs someone falling off the elevator and its perfect
wow,not_removed,i can see a pig face below the bluff
wow,not_removed,wow
wow,not_removed,very nice well done
wow,not_removed,add some color and no one would know thats a drawing and not the actual game great work mate
wow,not_removed,so pretty reminded me of
wow,not_removed,imo the best horde city ever
wow,not_removed,awesome
wow,not_removed,this a game wouldve been so sick in vr when it first came out
wow,not_removed,this is really nice i like this
wow,not_removed,very cool loggin in now
wow,not_removed,ive been playing tauren recently thunder bluff is so serene i absolutely love it and i love this picture great job
wow,not_removed,what is
wow,not_removed,mulgore in winter
wow,not_removed,i no longer play but every time i see something like this i still get that bit of nostalgia the days of new exploration and excitement a part of me is sad but happy to have experienced it
wow,not_removed,so many happy little trees
wow,not_removed,beautiful
wow,not_removed,if you pan over to stonebull lake youll see my character slowly going insane trying to catch a fish
wow,not_removed,i agree first time trying a landscape piece like this so i do appreciate your constructive feedback
wow,not_removed,yeah the lack of a coherent and consistent range in the size of the trees means they distract from the otherwise great atmospheric perspective of the piece the sizes are just all over the place it can really mess with the scale
wow,not_removed,well it looks like the one from ingame thunder bluff looks pretty small when flying over it id like to see a sketch of what thunder bluff would look like if it were scaled in real life though
wow,not_removed,i wish tauren would switch to alliance maybe they would if you didnt raided camp taurajo like they dropped
wow,not_removed,alliance can go to mulgore well have a very ahem warm welcome for you
wow,not_removed,theyre just trying to jump from high enough to get into the secret dungeon
wow,not_removed,i mean sorta the graphics would have been shit
wow,not_removed,of course im flattered you would do that
wow,not_removed,original content i believe it means i made this myself
wow,not_removed,says garrosh tho
wow,not_removed,theramore was a militar outpost cam taurajo was a civilian camp its completely different
wow,not_removed,is it really a civilian camp if theyre sending the hordes newest soldiers out on missions day in and day out
wow,not_removed,cant be the only one who read this automatically picturing chris metzen in a dark hoodcloakrobe
wow,not_removed,welp ive converted
wow,not_removed,what the hell did i just read
wow,not_removed,this was at least a little bit awesome
wow,not_removed,my name is william morris needless to say this surprised me should i be fulfilling a destiny of some sorts
wow,not_removed,get this man tax exempt status
wow,not_removed,holy shit he mentioned er eddison this guy knows his fantasy
wow,not_removed,i for one welcome our new metzenist overlords
wow,not_removed,actually instead of the book and all the other stuff theres just a single scrap of paper with one word on it corruption
wow,not_removed,why would he need to recheck those coordinates year after year like isnt that part redundant hollywood logic not bad
wow,not_removed,pretty tame for mmoc as i was expecting this to go south pretty quick before reading i chuckled
wow,not_removed,wait how does one have a head canon about real life does real life have a canon is there an eu
wow,not_removed,nah thats wrong true metzenism would end with and the thrall saved the world
wow,not_removed,hmm pretty sure youre mixing up your annual metzen catchphrases this years catchphrase is still savage until legion hits two blizzcons ago it was mega and the year before that it was epic
wow,not_removed,rmetzenism vs ronetruegod decisions
wow,not_removed,bless the coming and going of metzen may his passing cleanse the world
wow,not_removed,im imagining a gravestone covered in dried blood and bits of ash baked on
wow,not_removed,i thought everyone knew this i myself is a true follower of metzenism
wow,not_removed,praise metzen
wow,not_removed,so it starts
wow,not_removed,i thought he was going to snort the ashes
wow,not_removed,i have always envisioned metzen flying around in a hot air balloon that has his face painted on it he flys to the homes of people who hack his games and punches them in the junk while yelling in orcish
wow,not_removed,so damn good
wow,not_removed,its my headcanon that metzen is a hack who only knows how to write one story but each to their own p
wow,not_removed,i would sure like to see their official coverup response to this
wow,not_removed,thats kind of stupid and not actually funny
wow,not_removed,is this the shit post to end all shit posts
wow,not_removed,but he is siphoning the power of still alive authors too like stephen king dark tower karazhan
wow,not_removed,what the hell did i just read i understand being a fan of metzen but this is just creeper status
wow,not_removed,lol like the diablo dark wanderer
wow,not_removed,with a doomhammer on his back
wow,not_removed,i imagined him in a t shirt and jeans with his regular goofy grin it made it better
wow,not_removed,i pictured him putting on his robe wizard hat
wow,not_removed,im pretty sure metzens creative process is something more like
wow,not_removed,i used to call myself a skeptic but i feel like id be disrespecting the spirit of awesomeness if i were to question any of this hand me a robe i join your ranks
wow,not_removed,a beautiful story about a man and his thrall
wow,not_removed,according to this you need to die no offense
wow,not_removed,ever since playing darksiders i cant help but hear cooooorrruption
wow,not_removed,the building moves every few months to offset looters and raiders
wow,not_removed,idk is decently bad id say its in that awkward place of being alright enough to where you wouldnt tell your friends not to see itplay it but not good enough to receive too much praise
wow,not_removed,it doesnt say he checks the coordinates the most guarded of places is more likely the abandoned building
wow,not_removed,yes your shit post is the shit post to end all shit posts
wow,not_removed,that was amazing
wow,not_removed,and which one is supposed to be metzen
wow,not_removed,but she is my favorite thrall
wow,not_removed,none taken lucky enough im years into fulfilling that destiny i wonder how long itll take me to succeed
wow,not_removed,dont think i can comeback from reading this xx
wow,not_removed,deal with it bi
wow,not_removed,yes
wow,not_removed,we are all metzen on this blessed day
wow,not_removed,dude pretty sure william shatners a guy
wow,not_removed,speak for yourself
wow,not_removed,metzen is the blizzards fig leaf
wow,not_removed,i am all metzen on this blessed day
wow,not_removed,how are people still able to abuse it they arent but that doesnt mean everyone knows that
wow,not_removed,because the addon has no way of telling where you are just if youre listed in the tool theres a chance of you being in a legion zone which is what they need
wow,not_removed,just change your groups to invite only and your problem is solved
wow,not_removed,didnt think of that probably the case thanks
wow,not_removed,this is the answer i was looking for most people are playing in broken isles high chance they will get a phase and they use an addon to quickly join open groups or something makes sense now thanks
wow,not_removed,sad you cant do stuff like this anymore due to crz and phasing
wow,not_removed,i remember this i think i was with the crew during this man i miss seeing kote on ed
wow,not_removed,well warlock just got nerfed i used to play dest and it is my go to spec but it wont be the best i recomend going magepriest for ranged pvp monkferal for melee pvp and discmonk for healer these are in a good state now but i would just play what you find most fun
wow,not_removed,hey that looks pretty good the paladin order hall could always use more night elves
wow,not_removed,right before she rerolls paladin
wow,not_removed,that primal mooncloth set does it for me the nostalgia
wow,not_removed,so beautiful d
wow,not_removed,i love it
wow,not_removed,i wonder any rpers in here or someone who knows one that has tried a nelf priest following the light rather than elune
wow,not_removed,someone should do a shadow priest version where shes slapping a tentacle away from the book
wow,not_removed,i noticed that there is an overabundance of clothing compared to the norm for night elves and art on this sub
wow,not_removed,nice art but the beach balls are a bit distracting
wow,not_removed,all i want is a night elf with a different name than priestess of elune in the priest class orderhall is that so much to ask
wow,not_removed,d damn right elune needs more paladins
wow,not_removed,not a priest but i have a ne hunter who followed the light pretty hardcore for a while shes since kinda chilled out about it and has adopted more of a dual faith but yeah
wow,not_removed,͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
wow,not_removed,wat theres a night elf that is layer away from being literal porn on the top of the front page right now this is pretty conservative attire she is in a long sleeve robe and clothed up to her neck
wow,not_removed,hey at least you have player race npcs hanging out in your hall to start with
wow,not_removed,i dont think thats his point though
wow,not_removed,titled a world divided it contains anduins theme music by neal acree featuring julieelvenmusic followed by holy warriors oath by sam cardon
wow,not_removed,tfw pugs are killing heroic guldan and your guild isnt even heroic
wow,not_removed,what was the first song called really liked it
wow,not_removed,when bm hunters carrying the group pogchamp if people saw this weeks ago it would had been a lie
wow,not_removed,my guild wants to go back to normal again next week
wow,not_removed,would have felt bad but saw their high ilvls so it wasnt unexpected highest in our guild is flat
wow,not_removed,im heroic done it all by leading pugs let me know if you need help with strats
wow,not_removed,unlimited mobility is huge
wow,not_removed,the problem is that nh has bosses so even clear normal run takes precious time my guild decided to probably skip normal from next lockout and run it on offnightspug if somebody needs tset
wow,not_removed,i clear normal in give or take some minutes
wow,not_removed,my guild only raids hours per week so hours is a lot of time
wow,not_removed,well we are raiding houts a week so the hours we spend on n clear is a lot
wow,not_removed,if you think hours is a lot for raiding maybe you should just play wow more casually lfr just clear the normal nh and be happy about it with whichever remaining hours you got try to kill some heroic bosses you will eventually be able to clear heroic in hours
wow,not_removed,once you get the skip it should help you can just do the tier bosses past the first ie just do the first then tichondrius star augur and krosus then elisande and guldan can skip telarn and spellblade to save minutes
wow,not_removed,he is saying hours is a large portion of the total they have for raiding each week
wow,not_removed,but at that point you wont need normal gear
wow,not_removed,thats only more weeks and if thats your point whats the fuss about raiding normal were gonna be doing nighthold for months whats the point of blasting through it asap
wow,not_removed,unfortunately guest passes dont do anything more now that starter editions are a thing
wow,not_removed,sorry just cleaning up and found them thanks for the update
wow,not_removed,its not a big deal but was just saying that they dont do anything no idea why they even package them anymore
wow,not_removed,racial passives are added after all other effects and are flat additive numbers so in this case we get ad so a crit would deal normal damage
wow,not_removed,so your claim is the damage increase is not increasing the critical damage by but rather brawn the racial effect is adding ad to your attack when you crit ie totaldamage attackdamage x ifhit totaldamage x ifcrit totaldamage x ifvirtues blade totaldamage x ifbrawn totaldamage of x would this be correct
wow,not_removed,basically its like if something says adds crit chance and you have a crit chance you dont end up with a crit chance you end up with in the same way you actually have a crit damage stat that is normally the racial adds to that the talent adds to that but only for blade of justice
wow,not_removed,although im pretty sure youre right you dont happen to have a source do you
wow,not_removed,ingame testing and similarities between this and other racialitemtalent interactions nothing more concrete unfortunately
wow,not_removed,couldnt you just put a different mount on your bar per spec like when i play blood x mount is on my bar then when i switch to frost x mount is now in that slot
wow,not_removed,you could get the httpsmodscursecomaddonswowopie addon its not exactly what youre looking for but you could create a set of rings with various mounts per spec and randomly pick when mounting up plus its awesome for saving space on the bars
wow,not_removed,i want a set of several randomized mounts not just one think summon random favorite mount but multiple sets of favorites
wow,not_removed,good reply i use opie too for mounts and hearthstones
wow,not_removed,not entirely sure if bug but at beginning of mop you could glyph druid travel form so someone could ride you it is still around today but back then another druid in travel form with the same glyph could mount you and you could form towers of druids it was hillarious
wow,not_removed,i loved the if you were an aldor you got a neat little buff if you were a scryer you casted a bolt what could possibly go wrong before it was patched it was a great source of hilarity two fold range intentional beginning of dungeon target the farthest boss you can launch the bolt watch as the boss and everything between you and it are now charging full speed at your man group unintentional target the boss up ahead youre seeing for the first time just for curiosity sake cast your usual buffs for the raid and then watch as you and then every raid member by start getting teleported to the boss up ahead while people rage in the voice comms proced off everything cast a raid buff combat started apply cc and instantly break it hell just eatdrink and then stand up after one tick wondering why you cant eat anymore and then realize youve locked out half the raid and the other half is getting gleefully one shot by the boss you just foodaggroed the comments in the wowhead link have some good stories too remember warlocks life tap combat started
wow,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvounetdurgyg
wow,not_removed,one thats been around since legion release and still hasnt been fixed the soul capacitor trinket is completely and utterly broken in the scaling legion zones it deals multie times more damage than it should i still have a feral druid with a mythic soul cap laying around at and i can literally oneshot bosses in random legion dungeons ive seen the trinket go well over damage on aoe situations its extremely hilarious while outside and you see a of the opposite faction eventhough soul caps damage is reduced by in pvp you can still comfortably oneshot a player thats levels higher than you
wow,not_removed,doing ilgynoth on lfr one time and the eye just randomly despawed while we were inside fighting it then we were all stuck inside the eye area and everyone instantly died when the boss respawned
wow,not_removed,i honestly never found out if this guy was a hacker a gm or just a guy abusing a bug but when i was a newb a guy offered to show me his secret hideout and i jumped on the person mammoth and he just started flying away into the ocean took about minutes of flying was somewhere off the coast of durotar and he landed us on a tiny island that i could walk around in about a minute had a bunch of npcs with numbers for names and a small cave with a campfire in it i didnt know how to hearth yet and he said if i told anybody hed hack my account so i stayed there for days before i made a new character wish i hadnt deleted that toon in retrospect
wow,not_removed,fixed now but in halls of valor heading to odyn if a druid went to travel form and you mounted them theyd run up the ramp in moose form at a really fast rate
wow,not_removed,phasing issues questing and gathering in valsharah over the weekend i spotted a leystone node on the other side of a river i crossed over to mine it and as soon as the animation started it disappeared weird maybe someone else just mined it i went on my merry way and crossed back over the river the node reappeared i crossed the river again it disappeared again back to the starting side and it reappeared for the next five minutes i tried to mine it coming in from different angles but every time i was close enough to trigger the animation the node disappeared eventually someone flew in mined it and it was really gone
wow,not_removed,• during days you could eat this grapefruit buff from argent dawn for ap i think but the fun part was you could stack it ad infinitum and get tens of thousands of ap that only lasted a short while • you used to be able to dc when you were mounting a flying mount in tbc then reconnect and youd be flying but with just your character youd swim at flight speed meaning you could be superman it was great • there was a way in wotlk to get under northrend but for some reason it was stacked on top of eastern kingdoms map you could run halfway under the ground for a while then jump up and for some reason youd get dumped into archerus where you could get the flight path and then hang out even if you werent a dk
wow,not_removed,in vanilla there was a way to jump out of the terrain in razorfen kraul fond memories of discovering that
wow,not_removed,one night during cata i noticed that my ret pally was doing way way way too much damage in firelands turned out that there was a glitch with seal of truth that was causing it to proc and obscene amount of times some guildies and i thought we would have some fun and popped into needless to see just about every comp that night was rets i hopped off because i couldnt win and was afraid of a ban but it was fun getting to pretend i was an arcane mage for an hour
wow,not_removed,the ret pally bug back in cata i think where your cleave would bounce back and forth infinitely and do stupid damage the one that lasted like three hours
wow,not_removed,saw a praying mantis once he was pretty chill just sat there and hung out on his leaf
wow,not_removed,eoa my wife prot pala turned into twoseat mount the flying cat from recruit a friend i jumped on her to catch a ride next trash group she jumps in i blink out mage and attack she yells why are you sitting on my shield on her screen i did not unmount and i was sitting on her shield while she fought looked brilliant
wow,not_removed,tiny orc shoulders
wow,not_removed,back in vanilla there was a big where a certain combination of talents would mount human paladins on a kodo when casting certain things
wow,not_removed,relic of chiji at the beginning of mop on holy paladins the proc caused a white cone to be shot out when using light of dawn literally blinding everyones screens trolling people was never more fun in raid
wow,not_removed,yesterday we went for heroic odyn for the first night and we had mob from atop who kept gripping usand sometimes one of us got stuck and disconnected a funny way tovlose repair money if you ask me
wow,not_removed,definitely httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzrlifxutdw when moonkin first got the force of nature spell setting the targeting reticle right on top of an enemy player would cause everything around the player yard range maybe more to also agro onto them it looks like he missed the other player slightly when he dueled the one guy i definitely remember it working in duels id love to see more videos of that bug especially with higher level players it was amazing if someone tried to gank you turn around pop your treants on them and watch the panic slowly build as more and more mobs come after them httpimgurcomaadcdi are some other random bugs i found a good few druid bugs when i did lorewalker too flying around as an imp or orgre and riding things in various forms but i left those out
wow,not_removed,youre not sure if that was a bug
wow,not_removed,youve locked out half the raid and the other half is getting gleefully one shot by the boss you just foodaggroed i have no idea why this happened to our raid group in new naxx but we had the same thing on grobbulus we came up to his room and the rl says dont do anything almost immediately combat starts half the raid is in the room half is locked out the rl is yelling i said dont do anything and the hunter says i just fed my pet i said dont do anything fortunately for me i was in the locked out half
wow,not_removed,a similar issue i found in tw dungeons is the karazhan ring of collapong futures that deals shadow damage wasnt scaling properly basically oneshotting all the mobs in wotlk dungeons
wow,not_removed,this seems like one you dont want to post too loudly
wow,not_removed,out oouutttt
wow,not_removed,sounds like you got taken to gm island there were multiple ways to get there but one involved falling through the world which looked a lot like flying as you would cascade across entire continents
wow,not_removed,fyi mining nodes arent shared multiple people can mine the same node
wow,not_removed,was it actually that acherus in the dk starting scenario is placed in the northrend map
wow,not_removed,in case someone is confused ap stands for attack power
wow,not_removed,i was waiting for someone to post about this one this was a huge one when it happened near the end of cata basically they patched something that caused the bug for pallies so every pally was pulling like to a million dps depending on how good your gear was in raids lfr was a freaking mess no tank could keep aggro on bosses thanks to this bug several guilds got heroic rag and some heroic ds bosses down thanks to the bug and were subsequently banned for doing it it was a hilarious bug for the hours it lasted before they patched it im kind of sad i didnt try pvp that night i bet it was lol worthy
wow,not_removed,zero effort insect jokes discouraged
wow,not_removed,bet that was steve fucker never comes to family reunions
wow,not_removed,i think something similar happened to a druid i rode around on before fighting ursoc i got whispers like how did you do that and i was thoroughly confused because i had no idea what i was doing
wow,not_removed,its not a bug its a feature
wow,not_removed,lots of things havent always scaled correctly in timewalking back in wod the demonology scaled up instead of down i would easily do dps in a level dungeon with it similarly the dk i believe it was it was the tot set anyway had a similar effect that would also nearly oneshot every trashmob in timewalking it was great fun to maximize these proccs and absolutely destroy everything
wow,not_removed,ive made a bug report about it months ago and its not like im abusing it to clear difficult content all thats happening is me speeding up random dungeons that i do i level just a tiny bit faster because of it
wow,not_removed,true but the node only seems to continue to exist for after someone taps it
wow,not_removed,no it was the one in epl thats actually on the ek zone server
wow,not_removed,oops forgot we now have attack power and artifact power
wow,not_removed,i think i only did like because we were on rhyloth but i remember thinking wow my cleave is on point tonight
wow,not_removed,its more that its a fun one that will now get fixed
wow,not_removed,personally i see tons of resto druids shamans not so much druids were great for overflowing but that just got taken out of the game but realistically you should probably play what you feel the most comfortable with not a healer so maybe not the best advice also if youd like to run something with me my btag is
wow,not_removed,it sounds like you are going to be focused on mythic as your main source of progression with that in mind shamans bring some of the most extra utility on top of just pure healing however you really cant go wrong with druid or honestly any other healer for that matter healer balance is the best it has ever been
wow,not_removed,yeah i see druids and hunters everywhere now almost a plague lol 🤗 typically i would have picked shammy by now due to the playstyle i enjoy a lot but the unfortunate part is i love my guardian tank too ill add you when i get home tonight hopefully we can get some groupings together or something
wow,not_removed,httpsmodscursecomaddonswowhealershavetodie
wow,not_removed,sarena or gladius trufigcd omnicc omnibar yeah thats pretty much it
wow,not_removed,try gladiuslosa its something like that it literally calls out every move that your opponent is using bubbles polys dark bargain ect its a game changer
wow,not_removed,dude he said arena
wow,not_removed,i couldnt find anything i was sure it was by myndflame and i know it was about a rogue stealing a bow from a hunter and how the hunter was gonna take the next sword that dropped and share it on the spot
wow,not_removed,yes that one exactly
wow,not_removed,found the video buddy it was this one httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgmunichbvvk
wow,not_removed,its the realm asmongold plays on so im sure that brings a fair amount of trolls especially when he streams however i have a few alliance toons there and i like it well it enough i say go for it also im a thrall horde main myself
wow,not_removed,my horde realm is crzd with kt during slow times so i can personally attest that kt is full of dicks
wow,not_removed,kt is pretty good i would say youd enjoy it tbh
wow,not_removed,so as i suspected and heard i have to avoid the majority of people who happen to be dicks and trolls what a pleasant sounding realm
wow,not_removed,open a ticket if its not already off the loot table that has to be hotfixed or a bug it doesnt even have a vendor price does it i just got the ensemble via lfr and now you have me fearing its still on my loot table
wow,not_removed,its guaranteed to drop off heroic helya for everyone in the raid and it does not take up a loot slot dont worry
wow,not_removed,wait what one drops every time you kill helya
wow,not_removed,i have in my inbox right now and cant get rid of them
wow,not_removed,you can definitely make it to but i dont about and making gold for a token on a fresh account like that
wow,not_removed,hitting yes making gold not unless youre ultra lucky
wow,not_removed,honestly it depends on your time restraints lol could get to id say in days playing and getting the gold would be a little tricky depending on how much you got saved up now and youll get some lving up but unless you really do some grinding you might end up short running all the cata raids will net you around
wow,not_removed,region sever faction
wow,not_removed,with or without sleep
wow,not_removed,reaching yes if you dont have to do anything else and keep sleep below hours gold is gonna be trickier sorry
wow,not_removed,i believe in myself
wow,not_removed,im fairly young so i have about hours a day to spend
wow,not_removed,na storm rage alliance
wow,not_removed,with
wow,not_removed,i have heirlooms no potions definitely no friends
wow,not_removed,storm rage is the only server i dont have gold on you can buy a wow token on any server which is good news for you as for hitting in days it should be doable even wo using experience potions just doing the normal questing process is fast enough if you have friends to boost you with experience pots its much faster tho add me ill hook you up with a wow token
wow,not_removed,maybe but good luck
wow,not_removed,added
wow,not_removed,dude thanks so much ill add you tomorrow
wow,not_removed,sounds good ill just get you to make a level horde toon then give you the gold for a token ttyl
wow,not_removed,i actually just started an orc hunter earlier only cause i can only afford hunter heirlooms
wow,not_removed,i also play on stormrage i can try to help you mayne not gold wise as i am not a rich man but anything else sure name is like kynlaan i will sometime tomorrow as its late right now
wow,not_removed,im gonna take a wild guess
wow,not_removed,very close its
wow,not_removed,never use nge optimize thing
wow,not_removed,got a and and my fps are not as good as i think they should be fps in dalaran dps in arcwaycourt of stars i was hoping render scaling was set to but it was
wow,not_removed,wanna know why im an idiot because i somehow installed windows bit instead of reinstalling my os fixed all my crashing issues as well as a few other bugs
wow,not_removed,another one is shadows turn shadows from ultra to low insta fps ilvl increase
wow,not_removed,ill totally use this thanks
wow,not_removed,yep its the render scaling i got a and can only reach fps with render scaling since i have no performance issues with that whatsoever imo the increased graphics are definately worth using render scaling at high if your gpu can handle it
wow,not_removed,gtx render scale checking in
wow,not_removed,definitely trying this when i get home i was starting to get irritated getting fps when i should be getting i have the same graphics card as you
wow,not_removed,id love to know how people can stomach the game with no aa and considering fxaa and mlaa arent real aas it means you need at least to use proper aa i just cant stomach jaggies and the look the game engine has when theres no aa on
wow,not_removed,water quality is the biggest fps improvement for me going from ultra down to high is frames
wow,not_removed,cant wait to see if this helps me i have a gtx and i am getting low fps on preset and on preset which seems a bit low for some reason though cenariuss room in emerald nightmare always mega tanks my fps i go down to like fps in there regardless of graphics settings literally exactly the same fps in there at preset as at preset i have an and none of the cores are ever even closed to maxes out so it shouldnt be a cpu thing either
wow,not_removed,in windows if you recently got the anniversary update make sure you go back into the stupid xbox app might require signin and go to settings and turn off the xbox dvr was good for a boost on my pc also go into advanced graphics settings and turn off ssao because its not worth the resources it hogs should see another nonnegligible fps increase from that last but not least the remaining settings thatll have the highest impact on your fps for what they offer beautywise are the following shadow quality turn that shit down liquidwater quality nobody cares how ripply your ripples are surfacetension particle density spells are cool but not at the more player models are on your screen and casting the lower this setting should be if youre having fps issues and finally view distance if youre raiding especially feel free to drag this all the way back to you dont need to be spacing out and getting distracted by the corrupted mess of trees in emerald nightmare anyway
wow,not_removed,all these people saying about fps and im playing at
wow,not_removed,my potato is confused by your words
wow,not_removed,ah no way i was wonder why my fps had dipped so much ill check it when i get home
wow,not_removed,geforce experience is hot garbage it thinks that i cant even run the witcher but i regularly play it with settings all on mediumhigh it also insists on trying to make all my games fullscreen instead of borderless windowed dont allow it to optimize anything ever and just use it for the driver downloads shadowplay if youre into that
wow,not_removed,a note for nvidia users some people have noticed a performance loss in games in general when using the new version of nvidia geforce experience version its not a significant performance loss but if you rarely use this software you should consider simply uninstalling it if you use it often the small performance loss is probably worth keeping it
wow,not_removed,it looks so good on though i should lower it myself
wow,not_removed,i might have to check this since i used to play on max setting and i had to switch to mediumhigh in legion
wow,not_removed,good info i wonder if i have the same thing going on with mine i have a and figured it was just the graphical upgrades and the fact that im playing at
wow,not_removed,see here is my take on this what is the point for me to buy a dollar card if i am not going to use all its functions if i can crank everything up and run a stable fps why would i turn it all off to get having everything up running ssaa cmaa the game looks just amazing
wow,not_removed,need to check my settings recently bought a and i feel like the fps is low
wow,not_removed,my eyes might bleed if i turn off aa jaggies are the thing i cant ignore ever in games i just run preset with aa on game runs great without further fiddling gtx here still wish it was as optimized as overwatch is though i have that game maxed out and it is butter
wow,not_removed,i will need to try this when i get home i know mine has been even though i have a the optimization settings from nvidia seem to be simply awful thank you for the informative post
wow,not_removed,i havent played around with the settings much but even with my ftw there are a few places that my fps drops down a lot mostly in suramar for me where i drop down to fps seems crazy considering the card i have ill have to finally check these settings out tonight
wow,not_removed,ya i noticed a huge fps increase when i turned off aa
wow,not_removed,still no fix for the gtx so many people having issues with the blizz refuses to accept its on their end sigh i hate having to go down to graphics level to get fps
wow,not_removed,for me view distance performance was directly related to the performance of whatever drive the game was installed to view distance was causing huge hits on fps while installed to a moderate drop when installed on my and virtually no performance hit when installed to ssd
wow,not_removed,sometimes my cursor disappears and i lose control of the character with a serious input lag feels wonky
wow,not_removed,saved thanks man
wow,not_removed,and here i am happy when my usual goes up to
wow,not_removed,with amd built this computer about weeks ago and the random fps drops have been so irritating especially since its my first child thanks to op and everyone for commenting on this thread maybe my fps will go up once i leave dalaran still dipping down to there
wow,not_removed,i see no difference running wow with full aa or not wow is simply too cpu dependant
wow,not_removed,soooooooooooo i too have this problem but i dont have nvidia i have amd how to fix this
wow,not_removed,if this isnt the case for you then its very likely not your gpu bottlenecking you anyway wow is super intensive on your cpu if you take note of your gpu load youll probably find it never goes over or so
wow,not_removed,the optimized settings the game gives you are a lot better than the one geforce gives you
wow,not_removed,i had the same issue after latest drivers i have a and went from silky smooth locked to crazy frame dips was frustrated with it for a while until i finally came across the same issue already running at and it jacked up some more settings and then set the render scale to with aa cranked and some other settings
wow,not_removed,what do you use to monitor your fps
wow,not_removed,i will check this out mine was fine a few days ago and had been locking itself out at if i had vsync on my workaround has been making sure the blizzard app isnt in the background i have to minimize it the second i launch the game but ive had to turn my settings down to get to i was playing at with some settings tweaked of course
wow,not_removed,i have a similar system and was getting really low fps in some areas i turned off the tomtom addon and my fps went back to normal
wow,not_removed,my fps is fine all the time the second i enter nelfs lair and the first toxic cloud appears my fps tanks to gtx pretty much everything set to mediumlow no aa
wow,not_removed,having random freezes wow stopped responding change to directx and you will be fine
wow,not_removed,how is your dipping that low i play on and never drop below with or something to that effect
wow,not_removed,sorry antialiasing or i dont play
wow,not_removed,i checked my fps because i was curious and it goes from should i increase my graphics in any which then
wow,not_removed,with your system you should still be able to play in render scale and get at least im using a and use msaacmaa with a mix of quality settings shadow only needs to be on high liquid on good model draw distance should be reduced you get more object popin but its barely noticeable most other settings dont have a huge impact on performance even ssao is very mild im using hbao which is the ultra setting my gpu still isnt at capacity im using vsync though if youre using an nvidia card you can use nvidia inspector to lock framerate to which will reduce input lag when youre using vsync also set max pre rendered frames to windows default is
wow,not_removed,i use dsr opposed to render scaling it helps with not having aa on and is less performance intensive
wow,not_removed,ok so let me start with im poor i cant afford a new setup i have a hp pavilion slimline i upgraded the ram to i average fps and i have everything turned down as low as i can any suggestions other than buy a new pc
wow,not_removed,i have a resolution scale shadows hbao all have a few fps improvement by dropping them the distance sliders dwarf anything else though in suramar i drop to fps with sliders maxed and my gpu isnt even taxed slider murder cpu in this game i can literally get fps on ultra and ℅ resolution scale but not if i have those sliders at above each i doubt any pc can handle it honestly
wow,not_removed,op you should have more fps than that im on a and my fps is very smooth with aa put the graphics on and move ground clutter to and shadows to ultra high
wow,not_removed,i get in most places on a on ultra with aa handled by the game on max at are you guys running or something to get on a
wow,not_removed,i wonder if amd has a similar issue
wow,not_removed,uninstalling geforce experience solved a lot of fps problems for me
wow,not_removed,you dont need fps unless your monitor can support it the optimize settings probably realized that and increased quality to what your refresh rate is just saying
wow,not_removed,fps would be fucking amazing for me
wow,not_removed,why do you need fps in wow though i run with a at and i got everything maxed out at scaling with cmaa and reshade environment distance is because suramar runs like shit i average what fps and in suramar this is at
wow,not_removed,if theres anything star wars galaxies taught us its that nge is doom
wow,not_removed,its actually not bad if you know how to use it the problem is that simply clicking optimise uses the nvidia presets for optimal and their definition of optimal is anything that lets you get a stable fps apparently if you set it to a few notches below optimal youll actually get a nice blend of visuals and performance can save a bit of time
wow,not_removed,im about ready to say never use nge seems like it gets more obnoxious and intrusive every time they update it
wow,not_removed,neon genesis evangelion is indeed not great at that
wow,not_removed,it works great for my other titles like witcher no fps issues but now i know to keep a sharp eye out for stuff like this my mentality with nge is that its quicker sometimes i just wanna get right into a game i click and play now i know i should always keep an eye out for stability ad adjust accordingly
wow,not_removed,could you explain why i use this to put wows setting below what they let you in game and it seems to give me much better performance
wow,not_removed,aa makes a huge difference so try messing with that if you havent already
wow,not_removed,i have a aswell and the only way to ever stress that card in wow is with render scaling cranked up above the two settings that easily affect performance the most are the cpuintensive view distance and environment detail which basically is object distance if you set one or both of those to between and depending on which zone you are you should have a constant fps anywhere in the game
wow,not_removed,i have a and i dip below in dalaran playing on
wow,not_removed,i have a also on an i was having fps issues and screen tearing somehow under graphics advanced direct x was selected instead of or and vertical sync was unchecked check those settings if you already havent selecting the latest directx and enabling vertical sync now has me running the game with every other graphics setting maxed
wow,not_removed,both court of stars and arcway yield low fps this is a common issue dalaran is just many objects and players
wow,not_removed,my ti wanted smaa something on changing it to cmaa literally doubles fps
wow,not_removed,and a ocd and wow is just fucked impossible to get in wod garrison impossible to get in valsharah
wow,not_removed,im guessing youre on a higher resolution setting like or ultrawide id be surprised if youre only getting on a im on a with a generation processor windows ram and i run fps if i do a render scale of with middle of the road aa low shadow quality and max view distance all other options maxed out though im thinking about lowering aa more and decreasing view distance so i can get a better fps i may even bump render scale up to or if i can do that and get over fps if you are on high resolution remember that aa isnt going to be as important or noticeable as it is with so scale that shit back and get that fps up
wow,not_removed,just turn shadows to low huge difference
wow,not_removed,do you have your processor oc i have same and i overclocked to with a tall air cooler my brothers is with a water cooler block also go into your bios and make sure your xmp profile is activated for your ram cpuz your ram and check if its running under spec most often mother boards limit your ram speed to a safe zone even though the ram was intended to operate under higher speeds vs
wow,not_removed,im running that on a fx with a rog matrix platinum holy crap
wow,not_removed,did you turn off aa aa is much more demanding now that draw distance has been increased you should be getting similar fps to me i believe the are comparable to
wow,not_removed,ouch ouch
wow,not_removed,i did this but realised after of installing my room mate however did not realise he had made the same mistake
wow,not_removed,even just dropping it a step or two down from ultra is big
wow,not_removed,hope it helps
wow,not_removed,im using a too but would rather hit a constant fps in raids is this scaling noticable i thought render scaling was only for high resolutions or tv sized monitors
wow,not_removed,same card but valsharah had be sitting around with render on
wow,not_removed,yeah it doesnt make any difference in performance for most of the world but i have my settings lowered purely for suramar
wow,not_removed,are the kings right now
wow,not_removed,i absolutely love asus gpus im very happy with the strix right now it seems to be the best performing ti in maybe years ill upgrade to the asus
wow,not_removed,i find no aa in this game isnt really that bad the lack of polygons and just overall shitty graphics of the game make it far less noticeable than most modern games just look at these two pictures one has and the other has no aa if you look really hard you can tell which one has the aa but its not glaringly obvious enough for many people to care about at all id rather the extra fps over jaggies that arent even noticeable when youre not meticulously inspecting screen shots
wow,not_removed,let us know
wow,not_removed,thank you i forgot the dvr was a thing
wow,not_removed,on what
wow,not_removed,the only reason ive been trusting it is because i can play the witcher so smoothly with geforce experience lol but now ill pay much more attention
wow,not_removed,how do you keep uptodate on nvidia drivers without it serious question
wow,not_removed,i am doing this when i get home i have a there is no reason for me to not be able to run wow at high fps
wow,not_removed,can you update drivers without the nvidia experience i thought they made nge the only place to get the drivers
wow,not_removed,id rather have fps and lower graphic settings ideally fps and high graphic settings would be even better but id need a better computer
wow,not_removed,completely fair point i turned on max aa and im still pushing over easy it was the render scaling that got me also if i really really want render scaling i can just lower shadow quality and draw distance a little
wow,not_removed,assuming you are on everything over msaa is arguably wasted resources
wow,not_removed,it has to be its a shooter but to be fair there arent character onscreen in ow using aoe attacks all at once with fire falling from the sky characters with a heal over time and characters with a dot over time all being recorded with party addons with custom uis lol
wow,not_removed,i just turned down shadow quality from ultra high to just ultra and my fps went up like another frames hope it works for you let us know
wow,not_removed,let me know how it goes
wow,not_removed,well there ya go lol
wow,not_removed,its weird i can have everything maxed but view distance and environmental detail and get like fps at scaling view distance kills performance i have a
wow,not_removed,cant believe i never thought of that i may have to try reinstalling on my ssd
wow,not_removed,let us know what happens
wow,not_removed,let me know how it goes
wow,not_removed,try lowering the draw distance and shadow quality a little
wow,not_removed,go to systemadvanced then you should see render scale in game
wow,not_removed,had same issue with amd updated my drivers and now my fps is pretty smooth
wow,not_removed,good point
wow,not_removed,ctrlr its built in to wow
wow,not_removed,rather than use the default command i have my elvui constantly display my fps in my chat panel i use ctrl r for my hotkeys i play heroes of the storm and the r button is like your ultimate so in wow all my ultimates are r shift r and ctrl r feels right
wow,not_removed,ive heard a lot of bad things about tomtom and fps lol
wow,not_removed,do you have a mage if so hit a wae of at least adds with living bomb and be blown away i once hit over mobs with with one living bomb and i went from to like wow
wow,not_removed,everything just leave shadows water quality for last maybe view distance too these three things just suck up your frames make sure render scale is if you have amazing fps anyways see if you can run in a raid
wow,not_removed,i do just not everywhere mounting through high density jungles used to bring it down to i also just found out windows users need to manually turn off that stupid xbox dvr thing i had no idea thats like right there
wow,not_removed,dsr is essentially the same as render scaling though the driver implementation might be better they are both much more intensive than aa unless you are only scaling up a small amount
wow,not_removed,do you have windows
wow,not_removed,well i have like addons and i refuse to make a microsoft account which is required to turn off windows dvr lol im trying to find a way around that
wow,not_removed,i might not go that far lol ill just be more aware of what its doing now instead of blindly trusting
wow,not_removed,because you want a smooth frame rate as youre moving the more consistently high your fps is the better youll fight wonky fps messes up with your timings also ya your fps might be decent normally but raids and pvp will take a frame rate hit so youll want in the world so that youll know for sure youll be getting well over in a raid when things get intense
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,worst day of my life
wow,not_removed,its insane how they cant just figure out how to get you above fps they really need to make that an option and not that stupid obtuse slider most gamers want fps that wont stutter is terrible especially when you can see the janky jumps fuck your cinematic experience its all a plot to make people think they need a better card
wow,not_removed,its nice for the update driver thing but i only use it for that im also kinda hoping ill get a reply that says use this stuff instead
wow,not_removed,man thank you for this post i was wondering why i was dropping to a consistent fps with my and when i get way more fps in more demanding games now im getting upwards of and in indoors areas up to fps which is crazy to me so thanks
wow,not_removed,usually the game itself is better at figuring out what settings you need for a smooth experience than nge
wow,not_removed,environment detail and view distance is the biggest performance hitters dropping both down a couple notches will drastically improve fps
wow,not_removed,first thing i turn off no jaggies looks nice but at resolution you dont notice them unless you look for them anyways its a rather huge hit to performance for such a small payout to the op thanks ill have to look into this having similar issues
wow,not_removed,too bad you cant have zonebased detail settings
wow,not_removed,hey man i got the same prob gtx resolution on a screen but my fps keeps changing from to fps in random times i do not know what triggers this or how to fix this but having a pc for playing on sometimes well feelsbadman pls let me know if you find any way fixing this without having to lower the performance of the video settings
wow,not_removed,i have the problem with the game setting my refresh rate to hz every time i log in when i set it to hz sometimes the game crashes when i open the map or quest log and i get fps drops down to like in dalaran but am at in my order hall like wtf
wow,not_removed,oc your cpu bitch and ram at cmaa reshade everything at their highest settings except environment which is at never dip below and
wow,not_removed,vsync on no
wow,not_removed,i set it back to smaa after reducing my render scaling from to and now my lowest fps is roughly so i think i found a healthy medium
wow,not_removed,cmaa is awful id rather run zero aa than cmaa at aa hardly matters anyway and get fps even in raid
wow,not_removed,same gpu and cpu but no oc are my settings and i dont usually go below
wow,not_removed,are way ahead of afaik
wow,not_removed,i had nearly the same performance with my i assumed spending € should help
wow,not_removed,luckily i just installed windows in likejuly and all i really do on that pc is play wow so it was a fairly painless fix
wow,not_removed,yep drop to is the same shape as the thing casting the shadow setting nearly identical to the highest setting unless you look really closely and much less impact also render scale nearer
wow,not_removed,render scaling is basically a better version of antialiasing as far as i understand instead of guessing what color to display to make a smooth edge it actually renders a higher quality of the image and displays the best possible pixel
wow,not_removed,resolution scaling basically lets your gpu calculate a picture of your screen resolution this gives you way better textures but also heavily impacts the gpu performance in my experience playing on res scaling gives you at least double fps compared to scaling
wow,not_removed,its very noticeable and might not have a big impact in your raid during fps if you were limited by your cpu instead of the graphic card you dont need to go for immediately you can test by using at first the edges of characters and objects in game will look smoother and more detailed if you use the antialiasing settings you can try changing them or removing them while using the render scale the ssaa choice in the antialiasing tab is actually render at i personally used a custom setting that works well for me in the advanced tab render scale msaa color depth alphatest enable postprocess fxaa low very optional dont enable if you dont like a slightly blurry picture
wow,not_removed,does suramar give horrible fps im checking and it dips to about with a
wow,not_removed,uh titan xp
wow,not_removed,i have the intel which im hoping is good enough to keep the frames high or is wow just one of those games where its wonky when it comes to performance despite having a powerful computer
wow,not_removed,ye but its not a hit for unless your gpu is really really poor and if you are shaving off fps there is other options that would garnish the same results with less visual notice jaggies are an eye sore
wow,not_removed,a toaster
wow,not_removed,the witcher get back to the present man
wow,not_removed,httpwwwnvidiacoukdownloadindexaspx
wow,not_removed,it is not really worth it to have the software if you buy a new demanding game try to go on the website and see if you need the latest drivers to optimize the performance on the new game
wow,not_removed,if you have performance issues with wow in general take screenshots of your graphic settings both the first page and the advanced page and ill try to help you figure out if anything is wrong
wow,not_removed,they wanted to but they changed their mind if you use their website you can find the drivers for your card httpwwwnvidiacomdownloadindexaspxlangenus
wow,not_removed,i assume you have a monitor
wow,not_removed,likewise i see zero fps difference from scaling scaling thats to above seeing no difference thats when you know it isnt on your end
wow,not_removed,im staying at way more consistently which is still upsetting considering what i have in my machine gpu usage could be way better seems like i get stuck at after alttabbing idk of any processes that drill into my cpu when i go back to the desktop but overall happy with current results
wow,not_removed,oh i have fine frame rates constantly over in any situation im just trying to say that if you have a high end gpu that the bottleneck will be your cpu
wow,not_removed,i knew i accidently brought it up once on accident thanks years and i never knew the commnd
wow,not_removed,nice elvui i will have to spend some time setting that up seems like a good ui
wow,not_removed,awesome thanks for the tips i dont know much about these things haha
wow,not_removed,sorry to go to you specifically what anti aliasing should i pick i have no idea what any of those letter combinations mean my environmental detail was all preset at everything else is either high or ultra and texture filtering is at
wow,not_removed,yes it forced me to upgrade and i dont have any other os i tried to revert but it apparently deleted my backup i got screwed
wow,not_removed,as long as you have a stable fps it doesnt matter if its or unless your monitor supports it for me i have a gsync so im alright with the game around
wow,not_removed,is there any way to get the drivers aside from nge id personally like to get rid of it altogether i get a pop up every time i load the game up from it even after exiting it
wow,not_removed,man the last time i tried to use the auto updater it crashed just as it finished installing and fucked my shit up it started causing massive ram usage spikes on windows processes i had to start in safe mode and roll the whole thing back i uninstalled it and will be updating drivers the old fashioned way from now on complete garbage
wow,not_removed,np
wow,not_removed,yeah i gained fps low to fps by turning those two down from to the previous max the extra view distance was nice but the extra frames are much better
wow,not_removed,those rely more on the cpu so that might be why i got a and a tad older cpu turning those down helped a bunch i can keep everything else maxed
wow,not_removed,is vertical sync on under graphics advanced is direct selected if so switch to i did that and run at a constant with all graphics settings maxed
wow,not_removed,what graphics setting are you playing on
wow,not_removed,are you using the client
wow,not_removed,if you get screen tearing you put that shit on aap rocky
wow,not_removed,aa is an entirely different conversation you really shouldnt be using it if you have
wow,not_removed,im running about on ultra but there shouldnt be that much of a fps drop for him compared to my setup
wow,not_removed,really now ah so ive been misinformed
wow,not_removed,this is an option outside of the game correct so do you set render scaling in your graphics card control panel and turn off aa ingame or do you use both
wow,not_removed,resolution scaling is by far the least performanceefficient method of antialiasing you should generally use msaa and other techniques first before starting to increase the render scale as it will have a greater performance impact for the quality increase
wow,not_removed,in my experience playing on res scaling gives you at least double fps compared to scaling youre drawing less pixels amazing deduction sherlock
wow,not_removed,well basic math tells us that x its not surprising that youd get double fps at half the res scaling its only logical
wow,not_removed,yeah thats about what i get to consistently keep my fps at my refresh requires turning settings down considerably there so i just live with in the area theres a massive amount of dynamic environment detail and shadowing there
wow,not_removed,theres a certain place in suramar that literally fkn annihilates my fps and thats telanor dont know why but it goes down to lol but i paid for my god damn msi and by god i will never turn down my settings from max ever other than that i have awesome fps and lowering render scale from to literally gives me no fps boost it does however give me a massive fps boost in earlier expansion areas like wotlk and down
wow,not_removed,try reducing environment detail when inside suramar go to possibly this should be enough to avoid dipping to
wow,not_removed,thats a looooot of money to put in for a halfstep improvement lol
wow,not_removed,its a little wonky when theres players onscreen i have trouble getting steady in town and on world bosses and its a cpu constraint on my
wow,not_removed,that would garnish the same results with less visual notice did you look at the screen shot you have to try and find the jaggies in that picture fps was obviously an exaggeration but its a significant impact for almost no visual gain
wow,not_removed,oops fixed it lol i have tekken on the mind
wow,not_removed,appreciate it ill take some screen shots this afternoon if i can remember
wow,not_removed,hey dude im having some troubles to be honest and cant figure it out can i pm you these screenshots
wow,not_removed,yeah
wow,not_removed,this is what ive come up with so far with elvui
wow,not_removed,now that i dont know i feel theres a lot to learn about the different types of aa seems that deserves a threat of its own
wow,not_removed,so i made a reddit post about antialiasing after some quick research hope this answers your question
wow,not_removed,turn off xbox dvr that helps a lot
wow,not_removed,httpwwwnvidiacomdrivers but youll have to remember to check it every once in a while id like an easy way to get alerts when theyre released without nge
wow,not_removed,yeah i have a and a little older cpu keeping those at and everything else maxed is fine
wow,not_removed,is common on laptops
wow,not_removed,rather have a bit of screen tearing than sloppy input here though so no screen tears anymore
wow,not_removed,yes but what resolution are you running at
wow,not_removed,yea the is ahead of the and is way ahead of of the couldnt find good benchmarks comparing both of them directly in my quick google search
wow,not_removed,yeah the is like a
wow,not_removed,you can set render scale inside the game you can do it in your graphics card control panel as well though
wow,not_removed,if you have the horsepower to use render scaling instead use it otherwise use aa
wow,not_removed,of course im pretty sure render scaling is supposed to look better though
wow,not_removed,true im well aware of that yet im not very familiar with tech so i didnt want to put false statements and thus only noted what i experienced
wow,not_removed,thats not exactly how it works
wow,not_removed,okay thanks there should be an addon that lets you change graphics settings based on area or just in suramar and maybe dal oh well i was getting pretty worried about my graphics and if my settings were right
wow,not_removed,doesnt mean they arent kings
wow,not_removed,persoanlly i find the difference huge in that picture just the window frame on the left alone and the legs of the invincible stand out to me with that jaggiefuzzy look everything gets in wow if you dont have good aa on that and most gfx options are seen most when moving and in big landscapes same way you could set view distance ground clutter and environment clutter to about in that image and youd not really notice yet it would be a huge fps increase now go to a woodland with a long view in valsharah and ofc the difference would be obvious as fuck
wow,not_removed,friendly reminder to snap some screenshots for performance review
wow,not_removed,sure ill try to see if theres anything that can be done also include your pc specs cpu and gpu mainly
wow,not_removed,ok nevermind watched a video thank you praying this helps
wow,not_removed,could you tell me where i find that or is it simple im not at home yet so idk if thats a dumb question
wow,not_removed,i generally check every couple weeks for my other drivers when i have current hardware my dell potato is far from current though i picked up a because it wasnt overly demanding on power and it wasnt listed as the minimum required for legion my old video card was hopefully ill be able to build a good rig before christmas but im putting priority on a disney world trip
wow,not_removed,yeah but you usually would say then
wow,not_removed,rather have a lot of screen tearing than vsync on lol
wow,not_removed,blizzard are good developers vsync in all their games is basically an fps cap unless you enable triple buffering or atleast as a guy with hours of csgo and other twitch shooters i never notice delay by enabling vsync in any blizzard game
wow,not_removed,playing a tv lol
wow,not_removed,then explain how it works since your so sure im wrong
wow,not_removed,i mean yourte allowed to find the difference huge but im just going to disagree theres about or things in that picture that have very very slight jaggeded edges its almost objectively tiny when compared to how a modern game without aa can look its even less noticeable than the previous image lol
wow,not_removed,both graphics pages system is gtx gb ram
wow,not_removed,hit windowsbutton g click on settings wheel then it brings up a window click on the bottom to open xbox app turn off dvr
wow,not_removed,blame my ignorance im still used to thinking in aspect ratio the idea of confuses the hell outta me
wow,not_removed,not if you arent awaredont care to learn whatever the new lingo is for something you dont talk about very much
wow,not_removed,unless it is
wow,not_removed,til
wow,not_removed,yeah if op is running a chances are hes running at or at for example its drawing as much stuff as at which obviously tanks your fps accordingly
wow,not_removed,ill do it render scaling means of the resolution horizontally and vertically do the math and it shows youre rendering as many pixels as if youre limited entirely by the amount of pixels you can render and nothing else like your cpu increasing your render scale will have an effect on your fps that shows this
wow,not_removed,paging dr ucruyelo to the performance ward your patients screenshots have arrived
wow,not_removed,reducing shadows to mediumhigh will help a lot
wow,not_removed,environment detail has a very significant performance impact inside suramar more so than anywhere else reducing it to would give you a good performance increase and increasing it to even further under shouldnt be needed liquid detail was also modified in legion it doesnt do exactly what the tooltip says anymore in some zones it also has a stupidly high impact even when the camera isnt looking at water i saw that happen specifically in valsharah id recommend keeping it at high those two changes should give a great boost to performance on their own while having a very limited impact on visual quality if thats not enough you can reduce render scale but this one would have a bigger impact on visual quality
wow,not_removed,try putting environment detail and view distance to they are very much cpu bound
wow,not_removed,its been the last part for a while now etc
wow,not_removed,yeahshouldve paid attention to that
wow,not_removed,what im saying is that render scaling is twice as much as meaning its twice as taxing on the gpu which was observed by him getting half the fps than if we look at these numbers logically we can easily infer that reducing render scaling to would result in double the fps as its twice as easy to run compared to
wow,not_removed,those changes helped greatly im now running or so fps outdoors and inside thanks for the rec commendations
wow,not_removed,you accidentally a p
wow,not_removed,no one hitherto this comment has said
wow,not_removed,the only correct part of your comment is that is double its really not displayed in a way thats intuitive but render scale is exponential not linear is actually in both directions so actually the reason its not as obvious in results is because your ability to render a game isnt limited solely by your gpu even on a highend cpu you cant reasonably expect more than anywhere in the game that has a decent amount of other npcs or players
wow,not_removed,it is probably closer to four times as taxing on your gpu again this depends on certain games it could be much higher for example if i set render scale to on overwatch i drop from fps to about the bottleneck occuring in wow is almost certainly in the cpu as wow is not a graphically intense game but requires an enormous amount of processing power
wow,not_removed,its actually its doubled in both dimensions
wow,not_removed,aka uhd aka ultrahighdefinition aka is usually in consumer electronics
wow,not_removed,i think you can but it will take you a while to get some of them depending on how lucky you are
wow,not_removed,my macbook is instantly on the verge of bursting into flames as soon as i even think about opening wow im under the impression that it is normal i also noticed there is a huge difference between playing in a degree c room and a degree room recently turn on the heater
wow,not_removed,an excessive fan is a knowncommonregrettably unfixable problem thats been occurring between macs and world of warcraft over the last few years happens to be one of my usual links to check when i have a graphics question to make sure my cards are still supported and gives a couple of tips on fixing an fps issue will be your best resource for a walkthrough of each setting
wow,not_removed,my laptop has this thing where it cant reduce performance to avoid overheating so it gives me until it dies there are two fixes if you dont mind low fps limit your games framerate to a lower point if you do but resolution is no big deal set your render scale to and go higher only if it doesnt overheat if both things bother you mix it up or get a better computer overheating is a bitch
wow,not_removed,i was facing the same problem on my pc i have found out that the frame limiter i have set a year ago was removed by the patch check the video settings in the game and limit your max foreground fps i had to set it to which is my monitors default refresh rate no reason to stress graphic card to render more
wow,not_removed,hey i play wow in a notebook too and i was having heat problems too the thing that saved my life was limiting the max fps foreground to
wow,not_removed,well laptops do get all heated up when its doing a big load of work but before the update my macbook was totally fine never thought degrees would make that big of a difference lol i dont think the room temperature changed since the very first time tho
wow,not_removed,have looked at all of them couldnt find that much lol
wow,not_removed,i did both of them and it seems to be the best settings right now display sucks but gameplay is decent
wow,not_removed,have done that d
wow,not_removed,did it and it seems better now
wow,not_removed,did you even check the last link youre asking why your macbook is overheating i provided you with some resources from the game developer with tips to lower the workload on your macbook which is causing the overheat alongside the fact that macs arent gaming computers in any way not blizzards fault its apples issue and theyve been like this for years the only way you can not find much through those links at least the last one is if youve already done those things but your post comes off as you not having done much to tackle the issue all i can say is either buy a computer that can handle extensive gaming or just ride it out
wow,not_removed,ya im with you buddy lets hope blizz fix it sometime soon i miss my pixels
wow,not_removed,rwoweconomy
wow,not_removed,probably not dont think of the token as a way for wow to be you will be spending the whole month farming gold and just working two hours is less painful
wow,not_removed,step buy legion step use level boost step use conslegion to powerlevel to step grab herbalism and skinning actually do this before leveling to step sell all items gathered and sell bloods to the highest selling item from vendor you should have enough at the end of a month to buy a token im guessing worse case eu here if you play a day it might not happen
wow,not_removed,depends on your playstyle if you want to spend hours and hours each day in the auction house it might be possible but it is impossible by normal gameplay one token on my server eu costs gold thats roughly the amount i made in my entire wow life of years with years break d
wow,not_removed,yes and no if you invest enough time you can easily make enough gold for the token auctionhouse buy and resell items you need gold to invest farming old instancesmog gear like anywherebutflorida already said check httpswwwredditcomrwoweconomy for deeper informations
wow,not_removed,level to and then start farming it is much easier that way you can make gold an hour just farming old materials if you really want to farm i recommend checking studenalbatroz youtube channel
wow,not_removed,what do you have on your characters already professions wise it should be doable but it would require getting to pretty fast to capitalise on professions and farming opportunities youd also need to be playing a decent amount each day too id recommend smashing out pretty quickly on your dk by doing random dungeons as blood for faster queues up to might be better for this then you can go quests depending on your preference then go do the draenor starting questline to your garrison ready asap you can then start questing your way up to doing all the bonus objectives you travel near as well for this step id recommend resebbing on a weeking or whatever time your have free to basically play wow all day because youll want to get this done fast once youre level you can start focusing on goldmaking the specific professions will probably depend on your server economy and if you have them leveled already it will be a decent help alchemy and tailoring are decent professions for doing wod stuff and mining is decent if you want to farm for example you can look at sites like the undermine journal before you even begin playing to see what choices might be good once youve chosen the profession start doing the daily wod cooldown for the main professional material eg hexweave cloth gearspring parts do the secrets of draenor professions cooldown for some recipes try to get to soon too so your daily cooldown gives the most value also set up the profession building in your garrison so you can churn out materials faster if appropriate once you have enough books pick up some worthwhile recipes then you can also try to find the appropriate trader for your professions on days they come up assuming they sell anything worthwhile a few wod things that are worth looking at selling include draenic invisibility potions and to a lesser extent stuff like swiftness and water walking ones sorcerous earth alchemy transmute hexweave bags swapblasters goblin glider kits other professions likely have stuff worth selling but im not so familiar with those if you need some startup gold doing all the cata raids should give a decent amount and be pretty easy to solo as a dk then if you take mining as one of your professions you can fly around pandaria collecting ghost iron recommend you get mistpiercing goggles for this and smelt them to bars and either sell or use once youce got a decent amount of gold and have your professions leveled via wod you xan also start looking at older expansions for profession stuff alchemy for example you can look at transmuting bars works especially well with mining so you can also smelt bars be sure to also do the transmute mastery for an extra from your procs doing daily transmutes or selling materials for vial of the sands getting the recipie might not be worth the time investment if you only have a month if you have engineering already and have the chopperhog recipe then making and selling those is probably also worth looking at get the wow armory app too to keep track of your auctions so you can undercut and relist auctions while outside the game if you can successfully get to enough gold for a sub in the first month then paying for future subs and even legion with gold should be relatively easy if you dont want to do any of that and would rather just play normally buy legion and do content instead
wow,not_removed,please value your time more
wow,not_removed,yes i was thinking of levelling one of them to and then farming the gold farming along the way as well if i can farm enough gold to play for free i would eventually buy legion as well im just wondering if this is actually viable i would be playing quite actively as well
wow,not_removed,ok i didnt do any gold per hour farm i know herbs have taken a hit in the us from bots
wow,not_removed,basically yes expel harm used to be a self heal spell but with the new changes it instead just grabs all spheres around you heals you for what the spheres would heal and damages your current target without spheres you cant actually use it so you need gift of the ox
wow,not_removed,while the leveling of monks specifically is all over the place currently at and especially when played correctly w artifact end up being very strong i played all the tanking classes pretty in depth the past weeks and brm is still strong once you get used to how they work
wow,not_removed,thats frustrating thanks for the reply though
wow,not_removed,out of curiosity how are they strong when they are the weakest among all tank specs for damage and survivability what does strong even mean
wow,not_removed,leveling got kinda broken with the latest update at least for some classes i know theres something with mages requiring mastery and they unlock mastery at around or and they have a skill they unlock much sooner which depends on mastery making that skill totally useless
wow,not_removed,yeah paladins get a talent at level that really doesnt become decent until
wow,not_removed,they are still very survivable i dont see how they are the weakest been looking at the dk kit and theyre definently not stronger than brm they just seem to lack damage at lvl
wow,not_removed,they have the highest skill cap that ive seen from all the tanks in the betaprepatch liveif the charges of iron brew and purifying brew coupled with expel harm are managed correctly brms are nigh on unkillable the dps can also be insane keywords to lock in our managed correctly i saw one or two very good brm monks on the beta i also saw many more bad ones it would be a bad move to discount them automatically in my opinion i believe logs and breakdowns can be found from the top raiding guilds as well if youre a number cruncher it has also been strongly rumored things can always change that serenity will also be using a brm and pally combo with that wall of text i will answer that most brm tanks will be bad in that the skill cap is probably the highest in the game and very unforgiving of player mistakes
wow,not_removed,yeah waiting for your artifact power is fine if your already at but leveling up with abilities that do nothing shouldnt be a thing
wow,not_removed,yeah they super fucked up leveling most classes get all their abilities by level so from you dont get anything new except two talents its very dull
wow,not_removed,i know someone a blue i think mentioned that they are working on redoing the abilities around to unlock closer to ones that weave together as you level or just redoing the leveling experience with abilities all together i know they have had made many changes already so here is hoping for more updates in the future
wow,not_removed,the unlock isnt the problem if anything its a good thing that we get most spells sooner you feel like you are playing the whole game sooner the problem is that brewmaster as a whole feels very unfinished i miss my old tools like gaurd and dizzying cask and i miss chi definitly one of the hardest hit classes
wow,not_removed,been happening to me all night tonight
wow,not_removed,lol at people responding thanking the cm for um basically not doing anything
wow,not_removed,its not blizzards site they have no control over what happens on the pages dont know what you expected him to actually do in this situation
wow,not_removed,they have control over themselves linking to wowhead
wow,not_removed,and their response is linking you to wowheads support information in all instances that ive seen them link to any external site it is labeled as such external sites are always at your own risk its made clear that its a fan site and not a blizzard property so they dont have control over the information posted there
wow,not_removed,then dont link to it like if you cant control it and theres known issues with it stop telling people to go there even if you tell them that its not run by you youre telling them that the solution to their problem can be found there and suggesting they go there to figure it out its a bad practice
wow,not_removed,tonight i break down a match i played on my elemental shaman and provide commentary highlighting the importance to go back and watch your footage for any player looking to improve in warcraft arenas enjoy guys
wow,not_removed,having two different specs is easy and you could do learn your second spec at level if you guys are leveling together i would suggest doing balance for questing and switch to healer for dungeons for faster ques if you are alone play as a dps youll have a hard time killing npcs as healer good luck and have fun
wow,not_removed,dont worry about investing artifact points up to level after the amount of artifact power per point starts to rise at a higher rate but everything up to is pretty much meaningless even at artifact knowledge so feel free to level up however you feel would be easiest
wow,not_removed,overachiever has a separate watch list altclick an achievement to add or remove its usually used to track incomplete ones but you can also add completed achievements
wow,not_removed,download the addon fake achievement and make a fake achievement with the date that you acquired it it will show as of it is the same you link from the achievement board ps i do not support using the addon to fake curves and such but its handy for shortcuts
wow,not_removed,i made macros on an actionbar that links me the achievement so i can shift click it run local a printa and replace the id with the one for the achievement
wow,not_removed,love this addon i suggest trying it out
wow,not_removed,is there any way for someone to know youre using that addon outside of checking your armory dont really want to be branded as a liar when im actually not
wow,not_removed,as long as you have the achievement there is no way to see if you are using the addon people will check armory and see that you do indeed have it just incase but as long as do not write thr wrong date in the macro there is no telling the difference
wow,not_removed,gathering so you can sell or use some people pick tailoring with enchanting
wow,not_removed,something you can gain use out of bos would be my suggestion alchemy or jcing
wow,not_removed,if you are raiding or doing high lvl m i would suggest alchemy even just for the hour flasks it worth it
wow,not_removed,pretty much at the moment none of the finishing professions are that good for making gold for example alchemy has such a huge sink before you start to turn a profit that at this point you would never likely turn a profit enchanting is not bad for the disenchanting but dont expect to make much if your trying to profit from enchanting gathering is not that bad but i have to warn you with looming just around the corner that the profit in gathering is going to go into the toilet really quick with flying unless they plan on adding something new to gather in the new zone with no flying if you want to profit off gathering do it now if you want fun it is hard to go wrong with engineering they make the best fun stuff that said nothing it does makes or breaks anything it is mostly all fluff stuff dont expect to profit or for it to get you ahead
wow,not_removed,alchemy is also a good option if you just want some passive savings getting hour flasks is pretty decent and if you dont mind getting less than optimal results from your bloods popp is an easy and fast ways to dump them but other than that engi as you said yourself is awesome i have it on my main and i find it worht it for the ah in dal alone
wow,not_removed,back enchants at least on my server is a pretty good way to spend you bloods pulling in each no problem so he might be good there
wow,not_removed,made over with engineering right after was selling the boe helm after that i havent made any profit
wow,not_removed,try the blood of sargeras enchant from warfens you dont deal with random junk like meat or fish and you target the herbs you want
wow,not_removed,flasks go for on my realm
wow,not_removed,i pull in about each for my bloods doing sabers eyes about for rare gems and each if i do bulk obliterum through the alchemy trinkets generally on low pop servers bos are valued much higher then on high pop so it really depends on his servers market
wow,not_removed,yeah you can make money with the professions right after a major patch but generally outside of that first week dont expect much the problem is that and flying is going to crash mat prices hard so stocking up on things to sell like obliterum like for wont help since prices will drop super quickly you will have to be ready to sell right away if you choose a good market though you can do well with granted anyone that has tested the beta changes is going to keep their mouths shut on what will sell
wow,not_removed,really its so fast and easy with the buffs you get especially if you can disable the constructs
wow,not_removed,i dont actually mind cos that much id probably have a similiar reaction for hov or brh keys though
wow,not_removed,i hope the fish is okay
wow,not_removed,the problem cos presents with fortified is the imp packs they literally a tank on if theer is no cdmitigation available our this week is cos cant wait
wow,not_removed,its not too bad me and my group was pushing for this week but got halls of valor i wouldve done despicable things for a cos key shit doesnt get more dumb than tyrannical hyrja edit also volcanic on last boss in cos isnt even the least bit bad in the end volcanic is avoidable damage whereas fortified or tyrannical will just fuck you over period
wow,not_removed,is this hordeus if so im a frost dk and where do i sign up
wow,not_removed,did this on a with my ret paly it really wasnt that bad to be melee here but our mage kept dying and we had a paladin healer kinda rough having non mobile dps and a non mobile healer on this when we finally got the boss down i was the only person left alive with the tank and i put the final hit on him with life left on me after popping loh on the tank when he was that place is aids with volcanicsanguine
wow,not_removed,you missed something when blocking nameskaliiha
wow,not_removed,more like the hov effect
wow,not_removed,cos is literrly one of the easiest m dungeons out there people just need to spend minutes on the wowhead dungeon guide reading up all the buffs who can take what etc after that you zip through that whole dungeon
wow,not_removed,having done a court it isnt so bad i did have to abuse a boss to kill the last boss on tyrannical as he was impossible although the bug no longer exists using los to prevent the dash on tyrannical the boss required a healthy rotation aoe interrupts on the imps that spawn though but yea disable the beacons have an interrupt rotation for repair station los the fel explosion from enforcers and it wont be bad as long as you dont get tyrannical then the last boss is impossible at least on and up
wow,not_removed,oh god i hope that one guys entire family is ok
wow,not_removed,i will be completely honest when i read this i literally went curse of strahd no culling of stratholme maybe about kara court of stars oh ah yes thats the one
wow,not_removed,i acutally had an arcway that i managed to clear with a bit of help got a few random being equipped myself and we cleared in with minutes i dont understand the stigma behind these dungeons they are hard but the loot is ohsoworthit
wow,not_removed,its vow for me that dungeon sucks on m
wow,not_removed,i pretty much toss my key out if its high halls of valor lol
wow,not_removed,boltstering and the impsmana wyrms ugh
wow,not_removed,i an on the quest to unlock suramar dungeons but wont complete just so i cant get keys to them gear on them doesnt seem worth it
wow,not_removed,cos is only a challenge when the bosses are buffed fortified id say brh is far worse than cos edit sorry this is from my specific viewpoint as a disc holy priest
wow,not_removed,my last four keystones have been cos i consider them bricked no one wants to do them
wow,not_removed,i dont get it court of stars is one of the easier ones to get chest on
wow,not_removed,what i just chested a cos with pugs best dungeon
wow,not_removed,its really not hard i beat an in about minutes and we got unlucky with no dps buff
wow,not_removed,cos is so easy tho
wow,not_removed,i dont know why this isnt more common knowledge at this point but i will share in case it helps you the final two bosses in cos are both reliant on the entire group properly positioning position right and the fight is extremely easy advisor melandrus everyone except for one highly mobile class that can reliably dodge the charge without loosing througput should just stand in melee range he will only charge and volcano ranged targets try to position all of the charges in the same spot to make it easer to dodge their damage since the fight is just a burn fest having all of your dps stand still for the entire fight will shorten it significantly while also making healing easier talixae flamewreath again everyone should stack on the tank on this fight the tighter the stack the better marking the tank helps move yards when the imps spawn and rotate stunssilences on them if done properly they should never get a single cast volcanic makes this a pain but just dance sideside and dont stand in top of each other
wow,not_removed,its nice that you hid your characters name in the chat but not in the tooltip
wow,not_removed,anything below is fine what is the problem the only problem is tyrannical that makes the boss unkillable above and higher
wow,not_removed,i just did mythic cos in hour hahaha
wow,not_removed,i never understood why people dislike it its one of the shorter ones likewise a arcways will always fill fast and seem pretty popular and its one of the longest
wow,not_removed,i agree with you but volcanic on the last boss is incredibly broken if you cant blow him up really quickly really high dps at it might be fine at its pushing it and the and above tyrannicalvolcanic week would require playing absurdly well to kill him at all nevermind within the timer if you havent had the pleasure of running it each of the illusions he leaves behind counts as another pack engaged for volcanic so after the first blade dash theres twice as much volcanic then etc oh and because the meleetanks likely arent stacked on them volcanic will also be spawning under the entire party at once cos is fine very easy if you get the trap with someone to use it volcaniclast boss is not fine
wow,not_removed,does that engi orb still exist even ive run since havent seen it also saw a streamer claim it might be removed as well agree that its one of the easier ones but pretty rng dependent and the timer is tight with the boat removal also some people just dont like the feel of places i hate dht and brh but a lot of people seem to like those i also dont mind votw which people seem to hate
wow,not_removed,volcanic makes the last boss an absolute head fuck
wow,not_removed,i did cos yesterday on and that last boss was absolutely brutal even with us pulling for his echos spawned so many volcanoes so frequently that your healer simply cannot cast anything i have done every dungeon on but this on absolutely destroyed us
wow,not_removed,i dont mind it as a healer if im running it with guildies ive had some pretty bad runs in pug groups though so i understand their sentiment
wow,not_removed,volcanic affix this week makes the last boss hell
wow,not_removed,its easy until melandrius did a cos yesterday and hes awful
wow,not_removed,disabling the constructs actually slows it down since you get one usefull thing less theres only constructs you have to kill after disabling them
wow,not_removed,bad groups get bent oven and rectally punished even if you drudge your way through to the final garden with the mini bosses if your group is bad you chain wipe in an almost seemingly endless fashion
wow,not_removed,cos and hov are my favorite ones chill trash and easymode bosses votw though fuck that place
wow,not_removed,its avoidable but constantly having to avoid is the problem i had i main a resto shaman and the constant movement hurts when my casts are predominantly seconds once we had copies up and theyre also doing volcanoes i found it hard to keep the group up through slicing winds
wow,not_removed,did court problem is its a dps race we ran with casters which was our problem due to volcanic
wow,not_removed,the storm gathers within you hyrja
wow,not_removed,shit doesnt get more dumb than tyrannical hyrja try tyrannical helya she just randomly shots people and theres nothing you can do about it
wow,not_removed,its just melee feeling the pain of a ranged having to deal with volcanic the first week unnecessary qq
wow,not_removed,frost dk where do i sign up pick one
wow,not_removed,los the fel explosion from enforcers and it wont be bad a lot of people still dont know that and its enrage week on eu i keep losing my mind when people even after i told them totally neglect that fact
wow,not_removed,that id like to see mustve been the fastest run in wow yet
wow,not_removed,we did last night it was more fun that i expected
wow,not_removed,fortified is buffed trash tyrannical is buffed bosses what do you mean by worse do you mean completing the dungeon in time is harder or just more annoying because i think that the only hard part in brh are trash pulls from boss with certain affixes all bosses are easy even on tyrannical just gotta use some self cd for last boss first shadowbolt volley
wow,not_removed,try volcanic on the last boss at or higher i think youll change your opinion
wow,not_removed,are you on eu would love to do any cos they fill up instantly on my server especially with ppl having gear
wow,not_removed,if everyone knows the route and pulls its just so stupidly easy to get good runs in there especially when you get good buffs aswell no idea where the hate for that dungeon comes from
wow,not_removed,the aoe dmg from the images during the last boss encounter cant be dodged even if the animation shows otherwise also each images replicates volcanic and because melee are considered at range of the images after or images it´s became a volcanic fest for the melee with multiple volcanic spawning at the same time in melee of the boss dont know why you spread wrong information and even saying it´s well knowned but you should be more carefull
wow,not_removed,i didnt actually care about my own i originally didnt edit the names but remembered other people might care so i just fixed the one image before posting
wow,not_removed,i did the same yesterday its really not hard this week the hardest for me is brh with bolster or arcway with teeming now those are ones not for the faint of heart
wow,not_removed,its shorter but the last boss gets really fucking stupid really fast depending on whats up for the week we were having the issue this week where even our melee were getting volcanic because it seems like his echoes summon them also if its tyrannical its just not worth the hassle
wow,not_removed,arcway is so easy with small trash packs and easy boss mecahnics i guess something about needing to be keyed for these two dungeons makes people feel like theyre harder than other mythics nl trash packs can destroy people hov have huge packs maw is short and easy but tight spaces so one wrong move and youre in trouble fuck brh dht isnt bad but some trash packs get nasty eoa as castor dps fuck most of those bosses vow as a castor fuck the second boss ill take arcway and cos over those dungeons any day
wow,not_removed,its not about the time needed for completion its more about and boss mopping the floor with you and destroying your run when played incorrectly or with bad affixes people rather do long but easy dungeons see arcway timer is so forgiving you can easily do even if you wipe times my group accidentally finished a arcway with chests while just pulling each pack on their own with wipes we just wanted to to get a lvl key for the week
wow,not_removed,i havea if you would like to join hahhahaha
wow,not_removed,arcway is so un fun holy shit just looking at the map makes me dizzy
wow,not_removed,cause the bosses and mobs are so incredibly difficult to heal through unless your whole team is on point with interrupts and stuns and the final boss is a nightmare if your dps arent high enough to down the boss to where his attacks surpass your healers output
wow,not_removed,arcway drops the single strongest trinket in the game
wow,not_removed,not only that the volcanic is stupid hard to see on that floor
wow,not_removed,runs on seen engineer buff time
wow,not_removed,i believe the orb only spawns on normal mythic not mythic
wow,not_removed,yeahhh i did end up giving it a go we wiped about times on final boss and decided there where better ways to spend an afternoon
wow,not_removed,how we did an court this week and the last boss wasnt that bad lust carries you at the beginning and healer cds at the end
wow,not_removed,votw is by far my favorite place to run low amount of trash and quick pulls very easy to level to key up with an average group brh ugh
wow,not_removed,votw is so easy though theres like no trash you just kill all the imps by the imp mother and youre instantly at like mobcount and the bosses are easy as well one is a bit annoying but just run up to where the door opens to one of the following bosses and tankkill it there so adds come to you you barely lose any downtime on the boss because he moves back so fast
wow,not_removed,easymode bosses have you had the pleasure of fighting tyrannical hyrja
wow,not_removed,hoc is chill if you manage to pass the two huge pull before and after hymdall those pulls man better have cc or burn all youre defensive cd
wow,not_removed,hov really but really but maw nl really hov
wow,not_removed,since the shadow will also spawn volcanic melees will also get targeted by volcanoes it then depends on the mobility of your casters
wow,not_removed,frost dk is super strong in m right now my friends wouldnt do the nightbane race without one
wow,not_removed,haha yea just ran a with a bad healer and people werent losing and the healer couldnt keep up
wow,not_removed,haha not quite i was just happy to complete my keystone overall damage had me at about dps underneath the fire mage ive been shittalking fury for quite some time now but i had an almost warrior coming it putting up about overall dmg i was very impressed our dh tank was kicking ass too the cc that dhs get for demons is great for arcway
wow,not_removed,trash pulls from boss with certain affixes ah yes the potionchugging wyrmtongues are a real treat if they get fire breaths on a sanguine week
wow,not_removed,holy priest self cooldowns looks at action bar weeps
wow,not_removed,with tyrannical sure but a with volcanic really isnt that bad
wow,not_removed,whats the route for cos is there a guide somewhere on the pulls
wow,not_removed,hate for that dungeons comes from dying on last boss and ruining a min run happens quite often with not enough dps or a badundergeared healer i can tell you from resto shaman perspective that cos last boss was the hardest mythic boss so far nobody in chain heal range to one another and not enough cooldowns to cover more than slicing maelstrom casts
wow,not_removed,so long as theres someone to poison the first boss and a tank who can lead well its super easy to get multiple chests theres so little trash and the trash that is there is easy to kill
wow,not_removed,probably because if you dont know the pull route youre fucked
wow,not_removed,if everyone knows the route this is key just lost my key to a tank that had no idea where to go pulled the boss before we took out any of the other body guards
wow,not_removed,the images duplicate more than one ability one places a line on the ground and one is groupwide placing them all in the same spot makes it easier to dodge the first because of volcanic you would stand in more of a small circle around the boss than stack on top of each other but the general idea remains the same i cleared this instance on with tyrannical im not sure why youre down voting tips to help people just because you dont understand the mechanics of a fight
wow,not_removed,nothing wrong with that though
wow,not_removed,yeah theres some weird interaction between volcanic and his clones going on that makes it pretty difficult for a mostly or allmelee group to handle i did a cos this week and i can only imagine how obnoxious it gets above that
wow,not_removed,what are you talking about volcanic is piss easy to dodge as a melee i never understood why people think thats a problem
wow,not_removed,i just unlocked arcway and court like days ago have runs in maw up to even or so runs in halls of valor up to and over runs in darkheart thicket i just really really really really hate suramar and would rather not quest there every time im done with everything and bored of mythic i usually hop on an alt instead of going to suramar
wow,not_removed,what even happens in that situation you cleared the but upgraded it to so is your best dungeon or do you now have to clear the or some other to get your max loot credit lol
wow,not_removed,boss is super easy just stack on her each time she spawns imps back up three steps and blow them up rinse and repeat until dead last boss gets kinda crazy at high levels but with lust and prepots combat pots its not too bad unless you get tyrannical
wow,not_removed,cos sounds pretty fun actually
wow,not_removed,the chronoshard i think thats what its called cuz it gives a ton of haste but for classes that have haste as very low priority its not the best
wow,not_removed,not removed then but definitely lowered chance
wow,not_removed,ive definitely seen it on mythic but not this week
wow,not_removed,which healer cds shamans might have enough strong cds but unless your dps is really really strong tranqhymn probably arent going to carry it for you revival is really strong but i do t know enough about monk healers to comment in their ability except that everyone seems to inexplicably worship them
wow,not_removed,thats funny though because my group loves brh that is the one dungeon we actually really try to push our timer on i guess it helps when our tank can control undead the kitties for the added dps
wow,not_removed,have not heard of that tactic might have to give it a go did it like weeks into legion on or so hated it never returned
wow,not_removed,are the two minibosses not there before you kill him
wow,not_removed,last time i did a in votw some of the adds like the ones that throw the dynamite did not los all the way up the ramp they continued to chuck it while staying losd at the bottom
wow,not_removed,there is a single add that might not run up to you that you may have to send dps to kill on the floor its a caster
wow,not_removed,votw is by far the worst this week with fortified all of the minibosses are significantly harder than the actual bosses
wow,not_removed,postfix tyrannical hyrja is more manageable though we tried to push for this weekend and got hov twice she was hotfixed on friday night scaling eye of the storm with m level and we gave it a try afterwards it is still hard oneshots with arcing bolt and expel light but eye of the storm now is survivable according to our logs it absorbs an average of damage per tick on mythic
wow,not_removed,certain affixes make any boss a pain in the ass i killed hyrja weeks ago and shes fine overall
wow,not_removed,those pulls man i seen some things
wow,not_removed,targets everyone making it extremely difficult to cast more adds spawned the more volcanoes
wow,not_removed,boomkin firemage and destro lock i healed as an hpaladin
wow,not_removed,i was pointing at the time you stated in wich you cleared the dungeon fury is pretty good as of now pre they were okay too really good on aoe simply somewhat behind for single target yeah those dh ccs are aweseome there monks not quite off too though despite you get infight coming too close
wow,not_removed,last time i checked you guys still had desperate prayer increasing your max hp by for a few seconds that saves you from dying to shadowbolt volley just as well as a dmg reduction skill would
wow,not_removed,isnt that bad compared to what i cant think of a more difficult boss at when the affix is volcanic id go so far to say that you would be required to bring either hypermobile ranged hunters spriests with surrender or melee caster maximum or overgear the place to hell which i would guess most groups doing dont yet
wow,not_removed,the healer would not be the sole target of volcanic because the images spawn their own volcanics for that to be true everyone would have to be stacked with the boss and all images in melee range which is exactly the opposite of what you described
wow,not_removed,best tip would be to watch a video
wow,not_removed,pretty much only skipping the pack on the first beacon the construct on the bridge and the pat before the boss everything else is more or less like usual
wow,not_removed,i usually just tank that dungeon anyways since i know the route
wow,not_removed,i just did a cos and we actually only wiped once with melee i was an uh dk and i didnt really think it was that hard personally melee abilities are instant cast so its not like you have to worry about cancelling casts
wow,not_removed,really but blizzard said melees would be better than ranged in mythic dungeons and ranged would be better in raids why would they lie
wow,not_removed,wait what you can purge the shadows or the boss himself
wow,not_removed,read his post again it seems like his echoes summon them
wow,not_removed,the problem is the ranged people can no longer stand in melee to prevent them from spawning meaning their dps goes to shit on a very dps intensive fight
wow,not_removed,do you still have to go through the long questline to unlock those dungeons on an alt or is it unlocked once youve done it once
wow,not_removed,same here and only just unlocked cosarc the other day my first ever arcway was a and it was fairly easy
wow,not_removed,its a you still need to do a or for the weekly chest isnt much harder than though so i always try and chest
wow,not_removed,your max dungeon is funny thing is you dont get the finish in time achievment for making a lvl in time even though you never did lvl
wow,not_removed,yes max credit is cleared instance not upgrade
wow,not_removed,the problem on boss is the stacking dmg aura you can not use lust there since you need it for last boss it was pretty hard when i last had to heal it on that was in week of legion with ilvl avoided the dungeon on and above ever since
wow,not_removed,court is aids if its a tyrannical week
wow,not_removed,even on classes where the effect is typically bad the chronoshard is so strong that the concern no longer really applies expecially if you titanforge it upto ilvlcap at which point its timewarping you
wow,not_removed,shamans can druids for sure can monks as you said disc priests can save you with barrier paladins can pop wings and aura mastery honestly any healer can keep you alive through of them you just have to know your strengths
wow,not_removed,yeah if you run double dk that place is a joke but we do not have the double dk sexiness
wow,not_removed,im pretty sure they patched that out
wow,not_removed,its a good technique if youre on the higher difficulties it does add some extra time though so dont do it if youre trying to chest
wow,not_removed,thats good to know i actually havent fought her myself on tyrannical but it must be such a pain as a healer you have to burst her pretty quickly we had fortified on our run and the trash before and after boss was pretty fucked
wow,not_removed,is there a reason why you wouldnt just take ranged dps only and just do light phase every time
wow,not_removed,it prioritizes players at a distance from the mob my group ran it with melee and a resto druid me i just kept moving and they got to ignore volcanic for the entirety of mos and eoa
wow,not_removed,you do have to talent for that however in the same tier as our only mobility so we can have desperate prayer or we can be fast enough to get out of the fire youre right that its viable but its a pretty brutal sacrifice to make for it edit actually what ive started doing is just reserving guardian spirit for myself since the trash before the boss isnt too intense and you definitely shouldnt need it for anyone else during that fight works just fine
wow,not_removed,specifically with volcanic id say helya is way worse its really easy to get chunked from on that fight especially with volcanic and with everything else happening volcanic takes a tiny boss area and makes it even smaller id also say and bosses of darkheart are harder volcanic is quite hard to see on those fights especially with a prot pally and on the its easy for the tank to take a volcanic breath and just be dead while dragon boss can easily kill dps with volcanic thats hard to see because of the ground color water and combine that with push back or the debris and theyre just dead sure final boss of cos is in the top half of difficulty but thats because of the mechanics not volcanic you have plenty of room to move around on that fight until the very end and even if you have a full ranged group unless youre stacked right on top of each other getting of the volcanics doesnt hurt your dps to the point where you cant meet the dps check
wow,not_removed,ill have to try to locate one im tired of bricking stones because of cos any suggestions on good ones
wow,not_removed,yeah i mean its mostly true i like the affix system because it switches things up week to week
wow,not_removed,i think i parsed it out i think uthezem was talking about the last boss for arcway with the accelerating blast
wow,not_removed,thats not what i meant at all i meant that its really easy to dodge them as a melee
wow,not_removed,i dont think you know how volcanic works volcanic spawns at the feet of the most distant player if that player is in melee range it will still spawn a patch of fire
wow,not_removed,dungeon unlocks are account wide even kara
wow,not_removed,no clue my highest alt is level
wow,not_removed,hmm i dont know ive had the exact opposite experience my group that i push as far as i can with cheer whenever we get court of stars as our we did court of stars like times the first week and got our strats down and its probably our favorite to get besides maybe maw of souls weve never really had issues on that boss either just stack it all up and blow it up idk its been pretty easy each time weve done it even at high level it might be differing comps my group is resto druid blood dk fire mages mmbm hunter
wow,not_removed,it is tyrannical
wow,not_removed,through of them ok yeah this is where that awesome dps comes in most groups ive been in we have to deal with slicing winds is really hard and usually results in crashing across the finish line with one or people dead probably because i only heal in pugs where the overall quality of the players isnt necessarily as good
wow,not_removed,patched what its no different to following the boss and then taking him wherever you want
wow,not_removed,they maybe patched the creative use of game mechanics where you would open the door to the alchemy lab and tank the boss there in a corner hew would never teleport this way
wow,not_removed,cc one of the thundercallers in the group before the boss and nuke the other if you dont have bolstering and the only thundercaller in the group after the boss it becomes a lot easier then also use the right path after the boss it has two champions in it the left has thundercaller runecarver and champion what also easily kills your tank is the valarjar champions ability called power attack which you can either stun or outrange if you have no active mitigation or cooldown up just kite also the dragons breath kills you you have to use cooldowns against it though
wow,not_removed,the tooltip doesnt state it but her buff also increases expel light damage and arcing bolt on the other side which leads to oneshots above stacks you dont need ranged only for sanctify though watch where her first sanctify bolt heads and move to that position you dont have to dodge until the end of the cast the last of her bolts is on your position again also her melee hitbox is gigantic you can easily stand yards away from her and still be able to melee her
wow,not_removed,its not terribly easy to see volcanic while advisor melandrus is spinning either but thats not the hardest part the difficult thing about the fight is each copy he creates summons more volcanic in addition to his increasing damage which is why i mentioned its hell on casters your caster dpshps will continue to go down unless you can freely move without losing damagehealing as more and more volcanic gets thrown around you mention getting volcanic dresaron breath though breath has a decent windup so youd be tanking two avoidables at once and being dead but with only illusions out you could potentially have volcanics under you and be very dead if you were to continue to stand there im not convinced everyone weighing in on this boss with volcanic has actually attempted it at high m and up im dont think a volcanictyrannical court is possible even if we had nighthold geartier bonuses
wow,not_removed,right and if theres no one in melee range of the images theyll spew volcanic on everyone
wow,not_removed,sco has some really good videos check out his other ones for different dungeons all of them are usually or
wow,not_removed,i mean there isnt a single boss fight that inherently favors melee in fact court is ridiculously range favored for except maybe the first boss
wow,not_removed,thats the other dungeon the court of stars last boss is the one who charges and leaves clones which channel tornadoes
wow,not_removed,even better to have a mage p
wow,not_removed,you can also spellsteal it as a mage
wow,not_removed,sure it is not when there is clusterfuck of them tho
wow,not_removed,strange when we all stacked melee up until that point and in every other instance we just didnt get it regardless there is still way more of it going out in that fight
wow,not_removed,ah awesome i knew kara was but i wasnt sure if they changed the suramar requirements too thanks
wow,not_removed,na or eu we are on different schedules and i think cant remember for sure but i think na is on a fortified week
wow,not_removed,you need a group to be able to kill the last boss in this week on eu without exploit too much lost dps healing due to volcanic
wow,not_removed,the adds still come is what they patched
wow,not_removed,i see whenever ive done hov ive only done side only but ive never done anything over hov
wow,not_removed,i did a court this week and got a on it with my group that is heroic en geared if the clones actually summon more volcanic then yeah i could see it going up in difficulty i didnt notice an unusual amount of volcanics compared to normal bosses though maybe i just missed it
wow,not_removed,as a caster that has to deal with volcanic of the dungeon you just learn to try and always be moving on my mage its hard to see volcanic under my rune of power animation so its just habit to assume theres a volcano there at all times
wow,not_removed,how does range favor the boss everyone should be clumped on the boss anyway to kill the imps
wow,not_removed,just press lust and kill anything thats not with tyrannical is not hard
wow,not_removed,i dont know ive never had problem with them on this boss yeah theres quite a few of them but nothing unmanageable
wow,not_removed,eu is ragingvolcanictyrannical
wow,not_removed,na has fort would rather have tyranical
wow,not_removed,always excuses hhahahaa
wow,not_removed,theyve always came as far as im aware the whole idea was to los so that the adds came to the tank pretty much stacked
wow,not_removed,just go to one edge of the rune then youll see it easily its also useful in case you get targeted by a boss ability say the spinning weapon on hymdal and need to move you can go to the other edge and avoid a lot of them
wow,not_removed,exactly this my rune just slightly lights up and with combustion active you are literally burning and glowing and fire everywhere its not trivial to notice every volcanic under you so im constantly using icy floes and am standing besides my rune so im not getting dmg every seconds
wow,not_removed,he absolutely does our group had them spawning under the tank and melee
wow,not_removed,because as a ranged as soon as you spawn fire and an imp you can literally just move back and do whatever the fuck you want because you are ranged try playing a dk and playing the imps in the far back while running around your own fire see how much of a dps gain that is the fight is next to unplayable in m if you dont use los tactics its stupidly rare that a boss is not just easier to deal with for ranged
wow,not_removed,ah yea na is on a fortified week this week
wow,not_removed,tyrannical on the last boss is an extremely tight dps check unless you have a healer with lots of cooldowns read shaman we ran a group of guild players and pulling out all the stops took us attempts to kill him had we gotten it first time we wouldve it but the end of the hits ungodly hard with that winds ability he does with or copybros
wow,not_removed,is still extremely high our group of had a hell of a time with
wow,not_removed,link logs please if you can it would be very interesting for me to study them to understand where to cut time and where to optimize cooldowns on trash
wow,not_removed,when i said i meant max ilvl ofc which often lead to a equipped ilvl group
wow,not_removed,naa that was the bug if you did the alchemy only unlock room to pull him no adds came made it trivial its been patched
wow,not_removed,ah well the group i typically run with has a shaman healer so that does help
wow,not_removed,you guys are talking about different things bigmanorm is talking about just standing by the door and having the boss and adds come to you you are talking about the alchemy trick to take the boss to another room what you are talking about got fixed but the other method is still in the game
wow,not_removed,the intentional arrogance here makes me very doubtful of weather you actually can do anything above
wow,not_removed,lol is considered low i wish i felt that way my group finishing a is like discovering the cure to cancer
wow,not_removed,thats not hard to believe at all i run theyre not that bad but when youre being an arrogant asshole about it youre going to be downvoted not that hard to understand to be honest it makes you sound like someone who wishes they could do something above but is stuck struggling on low tiers
wow,not_removed,i like the emerald hippogryph
wow,not_removed,hippogryph cause its the only thing left that flies
wow,not_removed,the white with black stipes unicorn
wow,not_removed,which region
wow,not_removed,that was sorta funny until you unleashed the year old inside you
wow,not_removed,we had a warlock do that in my guild with the cloth forskin boots so you would literally be off the edge because he could move and cast that at the same time
wow,not_removed,of course its a demon hunter
wow,not_removed,i thought the gif resetting was somebody doing it right back to you
wow,not_removed,this sort of thing pleases me
wow,not_removed,for me throw glaive is broken in macros too it tries to use the tank version instead of the dps one and tells me i dont have that ability learned only in a macro though
wow,not_removed,switching to vengeance spec and then back to havoc fixes it for me have to do this every time i log in though but at least you dont have to screw with your macros all the time
wow,not_removed,unfortunately not just when you log in also every time you have a loading screen like when you zone into a new area
wow,not_removed,theyve played their cards very close to their chests with the music the only previews we have are from stuff theyve used onstream and from events music usually goes in pretty late as it is and it doesnt need much testing so they might not even put it in the beta and just wait until its live
wow,not_removed,just so you know there are lists of folks in the forums that are willing to be basically mentors to brand new players not to discourage you from asking questions here at all its just that sometimes it is easier to ask someone immediately instead of waiting for us to answer us eu
wow,not_removed,first of all welcome to the game dungeons and quests are your best friend when it comes to gearing up and getting experience rbgs are fun but you are better saving honor points for when you hit max level in order to purchase current gear they also offer lackluster xp secondly take the heros call should be in your adventure guide to the western plaguelands the hinterlands are for levels which means youre not getting as much xp from your quests as you should be selling gear on the auction house isnt worthwhile for now just sell it off to a vendor as you are doing and slowly your money will begin to rise to purchase riding flying etc joining a levellingsocial guild may also be your best bet judging from your post youve signed up on your own with no friends playing the game to help which is a massive challenge considering how big and overwhelming the game is to newer players and my last bit of advice is to reroll your character it may seem like madness at the moment but honestly paladins are a hard class to play playing a healing paladin is even harder at the moment your focus should be learning how to play the game and also enjoying it i would suggest rerolling a dps class such as a hunter which was my first class and is very beginner friendly playing a difficult class with a difficult role will make you frustrated and you may end up leaving the game if there is anything more i can help you with send me a message and i will more than gladly help
wow,not_removed,you are confused and lostina world that is huge good as your knowledge increases the world will shrink and you will gain direction one day you will look back on how noobish you were and wish it was now just enjoy the wild ride do whatever therell you want if it pleases you instead of doing things the right way as of actual advice dont sell your gear in the auction house because nobody will buy low level gear so you will actually lose money doing it you handle yourself really well with gear questing etc you wipe in dungeons because most people arent used to having a less experienced healer so they just run in because you probably dont have heirlooms you will naturally be weaker as a healer than older players but dont worry about it just focus on gaining knowledge
wow,not_removed,i always swap out higher intellect gear pieces for lower ones when i get them what do you mean
wow,not_removed,so first off you should just continue doing dungeons if you want the best possible gear although the gear you have doesnt matter much as you should mostly worry about leveling up currently as for the auction house part theres one located in each major city for horde orgrimmar undercity thunderbluff silvermoon for alliance stormwind ironforge darnassus exodar not sure what faction you are if you manage to find your way to any major city ask any guard and they can show you to anything of particular interest in the city honor vendors dont matter till youre max level really
wow,not_removed,you can find the auction house in any major city talk to a guard they will tell you where to look as for your gear you dont say what level you are if you are below level forty you want mail gear with intellect also a shield with int and a one handed weapon with int if you are you want plate gear with intellect also dont destroy things you dont want either sell them on ah or sell them to a vendor edit apparently i cant read
wow,not_removed,i havee mained a holy paladin since bc what realm are you on horde or alliance i would love to help you out
wow,not_removed,agree with everything except the statement that paladins are hard to play paladins are one of the easiestmost forgiving classes for new players to start with because the rotations are simple the secondary resource is intuitive and every spec has some kind of self healdamage mitigation my gf started with a paladin and she had no issues learning how to play it
wow,not_removed,like if i pick up a gear piece that has a higher intellect stat than the one im currently wearing ill put it on
wow,not_removed,i mean id say loladin is one of the harder healing classes
wow,not_removed,perhaps you are right though id still suggest him rerolling even if its another paladin in my experience its better to start afresh while having a clear mind than to continue in a confused state
wow,not_removed,at least for metamorphosis it seems to only reset if i used it while in the dream and not before it
wow,not_removed,are you using the totem before entering the dream or after you enter if a cd is used before you go in like using it immediately on the pull it wont be reset heres a log of it being reset for an elemental shaman he summons it on the pull then uses it again at then the cd resets when he leaves the dream and uses it again at he was kicked out of the dream at
wow,not_removed,so what the dream does is it puts a copy of you at your current state sleeping while your clones sitting there its manahealthcooldowns regenerate at its normal rate the dream lasts minutes so if you dont pop out early and you popped all your minutes before you go in then youll come out with them but fire ele is a min cd so if you pop it on pull then go into the dream if minutes hasnt passed then it wont be back up if you save it for when youre in the dream and pop it the clone will have had it up the whole time and then youll get it when you leave
wow,not_removed,yeah the logical reason is that you dont understand the mechanic of the fight
wow,not_removed,so im not going crazy good to know
wow,not_removed,our ele shaman does just fine on the dps
wow,not_removed,and demeaning him is obviously better than explaining it to him right
wow,not_removed,use cds in the dream not out
wow,not_removed,just based on your answer here this is the reason the dream doesnt reset your cds you enter the dream in whatever state youre at beforehand while in the dream you can use cds and theyll be reset upon exiting the dream because you didnt use them while awake
wow,not_removed,yup if you hit surrender before the dream starts then you dont get it back the dream basically turns back time to the moment you entered the dream and puts everything back to like it was then if i had seconds left on a cd the moment i enter the dream leaving the dream will reset the cd to seconds even if it was lower than that at the moment i left
wow,not_removed,there are tons of explanations online not need to spoonfeed him dude doesnt even question the situation assumes he is right and its blizzard fault without even consulting other elemental shamans players in his guild or just checking logs sure as hell not gonna do the work for him with that attitude not to mention that upon reading comments here later people already explaoned it
wow,not_removed,this is wrong you use cds both inside and outside the dream the exception are spells that have long cooldowns those spells it is generally preferable to use inside the dream if the fight lasts less than mins you need to wait for the dream to cast them otherwise you will only get off if the fight lasts longer than mins you should cast it on pull in case you get the second dream guy for example got casts off because the fight took very long since he had to stay inside the second dream for the entire duration on a spell with a min cd you use it on pull with prepot and pray that you get the second dream for havoc dh you use metamorphosis on pull you use it towards the end of the dream when it comes off cd and you use it again once the dream is over bonus points if you chain descend to madness which is a mechanic that also favours the second dream on a spell with a min cd you just spam it on cd essentially you use cd spells outside the dream if they will come off cooldown when you will be inside the dream or for spells like meta the only way to get more than casts off in a fight is if you get the second dream so you use it on cooldown tldr second dream or wipe
wow,not_removed,thats not true the cd keeps on ticking in the dream if you had a min when you enter the dream leave after min you will have min cd left
wow,not_removed,tldr use cds in the dream not out unless its a short cd
wow,not_removed,i am glad we agree that your previous post was almost entirely wrong considering you listed the exception very long cd as the rule min cd your post is also not the kind of advice that helps a new player to optimize their damage you second post is also deceptive considering stuff like metamorphosis is certainly not a short cd at mins even crusade is not a short cd at mins
wow,not_removed,dont know if they fixed it but there is a bug where if you logmy case or zoneive heard the bits youve completed return to not completed status id investigate on wowhead but its likely best to just skip it for now
wow,not_removed,the hell you say if youre going to repost at least make it less obvious change the title and erase the signature on the image
wow,not_removed,toosoon
wow,not_removed,i made this into a card last year and gave it to my bf he still has it hanging on his desk
wow,not_removed,loool at least give it a different title
wow,not_removed,im getting more disconnects than lag but its really bad tonight
wow,not_removed,i died to a gulp frog yeah servers are laggy
wow,not_removed,yep a lot of random disconnects
wow,not_removed,yep ive had latencydisconnects like all night i can only stay in like mins at a time max before latency kills and dcs me or i just close the game myself when i see im about to dc so i can relog before i get kicked from dungeons or anything
wow,not_removed,i assume lightbringer kept dumping me out
wow,not_removed,dat poison doe
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,fix ur shit blizzard
wow,not_removed,really hurts when youre incapable of moving from the aoe
wow,not_removed,you can change your keybinds to turn instead by default a and d are set to strafe but you can change them to turn this isnt very efficient for turning though the mouse is an active part of the game
wow,not_removed,play the game more and you really wont want this to be your default setting
wow,not_removed,yeah you definitely dont want this setting just play more and youll get used to it
wow,not_removed,not that i know of but with tab targeting being in the state it is id wager that youll need your mouse cursor free for emergency targeting anyway lol
wow,not_removed,arent they initially set to turn but you should change them to strafe
wow,not_removed,i use mouse for both mythic and mythic plus tank
wow,not_removed,used to be but i think they are set to strafe now at least they were when i reinstalled the game and had to redo my keybinds
wow,not_removed,wait until level or then start the quest neither both are equally terrible no one is truly winning and everyone is an asshole its like real life youll meet good and bad people on both sides i recommend horde its about survival your choice wowhead just look it up what you want to know boost is time only dalaran us
wow,not_removed,if you use a character boost youll be boosted to level where youll get your artifact weapon introduction quest if you choose not to boost i believe you get informed at level both sides are equally kind you will never strictly find a kinder side since both sides have that occasional group of rude people at best try and find a server on warcraftrealmscom to get an idea how many hordealliance are on your server in mind legion has introduced class trials where you can get a chance to try out any class any spec for free upon purchasing legion should you be happy with your choice you can boost it to if you havent played in a while it would be wise to use a class trial before using a boost legion has introduced catchup mechanics so you wont fall too far behind most people as the other comment said wowhead is a good place to start if youre looking for news or mmochampion your boost can only be used once unless you purchase another one as i said earlier check out warcraftrealms for better ideas on each server hope i was able to help dont hesitate to ask more questions
wow,not_removed,ill ignore this i prefer horde for the storylines and the general take on things playerbase its both toxic and fun at the same time i play mainly blood elves but played goblin rogue and tauren druid healers priest shaman druid are in good positions tank druid paladin dh warrior in that order tbh dps all seem to be fine atm of the hunter specs are a bit lacky all in all i dont see a lot of bad specs pick a realm thats favored once side or balanced defias brotherhood eu for example depending on what you prefer i like wpvp so i play on a balanced server
wow,not_removed,im on europe c
wow,not_removed,thanks youre awesome btw just wondering do you think a day is enough to cathcup c
wow,not_removed,levelling from isnt a tremendously long process and i would advise you to level at your own pace and enjoy the story of both the broken isles and your class campaign if youre in a desperate rush to level though get the conslegion addon which maps out the optimal route for the fastest levelling i cannot speak from experience as to how long it will take for a fresh to catch up with the rest in terms of gear world quests consider them a much alternative to dailies will help out a lot blizzard introduced a neat catch up mechanic in which allows you to level up your artifact weapon much faster several quests were also tweaked to accommodate newer players catching up overall i think hours should suffice maybe pitch in a tiny bit more if you really want to be en par with all the rest more importantly at the end of the day enjoy it
wow,not_removed,sorry but can someone explain what im looking at and how its exclusive to
wow,not_removed,i speak for the trees i am the trees
wow,not_removed,are you guys at a concert or something
wow,not_removed,glyph has always been around i would use it on my boomkin
wow,not_removed,oh how ive missed you treeform
wow,not_removed,tree form is now a talent for resto druids
wow,not_removed,glyph of the treant has been there before the prepatch
wow,not_removed,why glyph of the treant wasnt good enough
wow,not_removed,it was always a glyph anyway
wow,not_removed,i prefer tell me when due to its ease of use and set up compared to weak auras
wow,not_removed,i tend to steer away from addons that require you to download packs user made presets or lots of time to set up i see what weakauras can do but tell me when is easier and even easier than tell me when is quartzs proc module now of course quartzs proc module is only good if you like timer bars kinda like you see from dbm
wow,not_removed,i use tmw as its simple and easy to use and learn only problem is that with patch updates i lost all my tmw plates as a patch corrupted my file but i love the addon
wow,not_removed,weakauras allow to jump deeper in things more advanceduse lua while tmw focuses more on the ease of use and faster setup of basic tracking
wow,not_removed,last time i checked tmw did allow to do some complicated things with lua too
wow,not_removed,you can do all of the above with tmw as well just have to be a bit more creative the condition settings for icons allow for some really complex things but weakauras is definitely the better if you want to track your fishing per minute while also recording how many buttons youve pressed on your hunter alt wont be that much at the same time both are good but for different purposes
wow,not_removed,thats not how it works your bag ilvl is just what your highest achievable ilvl is including equipped gear
wow,not_removed,make sure you wear legendary that are best for you duh
wow,not_removed,read chart left more confused
wow,not_removed,i kind of like brewmasters they take slightly more damage but never ever take any burst damage all consistent relaxing almost
wow,not_removed,enter lfg for hh daily my brm is been running hh starting at greet everyone onetwo greet as well fight starts doing my brm thing and notice pala keeps pulling aggro never had issues before for hh taunt back several times kept aggro pretty well the whole time other than that got heals and hp was managed well thanks to brews fight ends i look through skada for why pala kept pulling aggro notice eye of tyr all my fucking what apparently ilvl pala switched to tank spec at load after noticing i was a brm 😑 for a minute fight
wow,not_removed,fun lesser known brewmaster fact the beer chart is also accurate if thats the number of actual pints you chugged since the start of the fight
wow,not_removed,brm main here can confirm also dont forget to add the part where you need to tell everyone youre a brm main
wow,not_removed,one of my lfr emerald nightmare tanks was a female dwarf brewmaster i was in the presence of a god
wow,not_removed,am healer find brewmasters ludicrously easy to heal i cant imagine why anyone would dislike them
wow,not_removed,almost never see a brewmaster monk and ive also never had a problem healing them wish that could be said for dhs and prot pallies
wow,not_removed,greated
wow,not_removed,brm is such a fun spec
wow,not_removed,there are no more sides to expel and yet im still laughing
wow,not_removed,i think this chart might be the only truly useful one of them for people who have not played the spec but were interested in trying it out sir or madam
wow,not_removed,surprisingly accurate
wow,not_removed,ayy im not the only brewmaster here
wow,not_removed,looking at this pic unzoomed legitimately made it look like some sort of cookbook recipe
wow,not_removed,going forward all flow charts need to follow this format
wow,not_removed,i lead pugs through norm and hero en as a tank quite a bit and mean every week since release and i am sad to see how i have yet to run with a brewmaster i want to make one so bad i kinda like the challenge
wow,not_removed,well i never want to try brewmaster now thanks
wow,not_removed,awesome flowchart
wow,not_removed,brm here main speconly spec brm is the most satisfying and rewarding spec i have played in my twelve years of wow we are an extremely sturdy chainpulling machine i would argue one of the most robust tanks for mythics mythics with the first third of kara and brh being the most difficult cleared so far i also took a pug group through en normal and didnt die a single time this was after clearing heroic en in week of raidrelease as an vengeance dh so the strats fresh and familiar
wow,not_removed,that is the funniest yet most informative and spot on one ive seen so far well done sir
wow,not_removed,the jiggly puff graphic brought back some memoies thanks for that
wow,not_removed,you forgot the part where you reroll warrior in all seriousness thanks for this im rusty getting rejected and having to log on my druid
wow,not_removed,fittingly you just know galifianakis would be a drunken master too
wow,not_removed,brewmaster fo life yo
wow,not_removed,i rolled a brm after stream rolling content as a resto druid its a whole new game for me love the spec when i play well i feel brokenly good but i do feel like playing badly is more punished for us than other tanks
wow,not_removed,ive had no issues healim brm as a holy priest
wow,not_removed,am healer ran a noob kara run with a pugged brewmaster never asked what should i do just healed him normally noticed that he can come back more easily thats it we wiped because we had no idea what the mechanics are i dont understand this fuss around brm is it an inside joke
wow,not_removed,the chart seems to be missing
wow,not_removed,where is the reti one did i miss it
wow,not_removed,brewmaster is a great class trying to learn it makes you want to drink real beers for authenticity
wow,not_removed,play brewmaster drunk it makes it more fun
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,ive switched to mistweaver main but i spend a lot of time on brewmaster for all open world and have done a few quick and easy things as brm all i can say is weakauras lots and lots of weakauras it would be a lot of work but you could put the rules of the beer chart into a weakaura display that gives you a better idea of which brew to use at a particular moment
wow,not_removed,this is missing the section where you have haste and have blackout combo oh and if youre lucky and get the legendary tunic you then have two other rotations to do one for damage or one for raw defense so you could further complicate this
wow,not_removed,no one is worried in lfr otherwise this is great
wow,not_removed,well thats how now just to practice i am sure auras mod will help with making this logic gates appear on screen for you
wow,not_removed,first post they dont want me in any group then bath tubs in class halls now this stop
wow,not_removed,i am brm and i done although this chart does accurately describe the rotation no slacking on the job thats for sure
wow,not_removed,flowchart
wow,not_removed,wat
wow,not_removed,what is a brew master is it a new profession who brew drinks like cooking make food
wow,not_removed,brewmaster is so good in the right hands thanks for this post
wow,not_removed,if you collect the same amount of words from the title and change the words you can write a protection pala rotation with them
wow,not_removed,late on the bandwagon but just desperate enough for the karma eh
wow,not_removed,yeah you probably understood it just fine you have three basic moves ironskin brew turn some incoming damage into a dot makes you less squishy but does not actually mitigate damage purifying brew removes some of that dot expel harm manually pick up healing orbs heal yourself ironskin brew and purifying brew share charges which makes using them a bit complicated sometimes you want to be carried by the healers when theres no raid damage going off to build up brews then you use ironskin brew when you have plenty of health and need to start mitigating more then purifying brew when youre carrying a big dot and need to get rid of it expel harm when your actual health bar gets too low your current health brew charges stagger dot size healer mana raid health and number of healing orbs on the ground all need to be considered when deciding what to do next or you could make a prot warrior map every button to ignore pain or shield block and roll your face back and forth across the keyboard until you win brewmasters are fun but they do take practice
wow,not_removed,and this chart skipped over the blackout combo talent entirely which gives you several additional options
wow,not_removed,i tried to keep it as simple as possible lol
wow,not_removed,yeah i explain it to my healers like i always need heals but im probably not in danger right up until people think its going too smooth so they pull extra packs
wow,not_removed,as a brewmaster you dont really get spiked at all and you dont heal yourself up very much i tend to get worn down rather than blown up its nice
wow,not_removed,they seem like they would go really well with disc just chilling out with atonement healing and some occasional shields or droods for them rolling hots
wow,not_removed,i had the same happening with a dh queing into hh as tank he got destroyed by the boss while i was trying to heal i tanked most fight as ilvl pala and was wondering why everyone was dieing i successfuly wiped on hh with shame dh says he didnt switch spec and was still dps we had no tank it happens a lot
wow,not_removed,maybe he queued for the bag and thought he got in as tank instead of dpshealer
wow,not_removed,tbf i healed that once on an alt and i regretted not going enhancement couldve kept everyone topped off with a single maelstrom surge here and there
wow,not_removed,id rather my tank switch to dps in that fight its a joke to heal
wow,not_removed,hh
wow,not_removed,i dont even tank it in tank spec why would someone purposely switch to tank for hh
wow,not_removed,i have literally not seen one at all this xpac its bizzare
wow,not_removed,my favorite is doing mythic an asking the healer if they have much experience with healing brewmasters usually theyre like i think i saw one once i think
wow,not_removed,rip legendary chances
wow,not_removed,we exist we are few we are
wow,not_removed,the reason is they have to use the same charge system for both iron skin brew aka dmg reduction and purifying brew damage purification in high level m and hard hitting raid bosses you have to keep isb up to not be squishy but at the sametime you must have to purify that damage or else youll be taking health dots on yourself every second in these situations you run out of brews often and you find yourself out of options
wow,not_removed,its called many different things but i know it by the talon effect despite being statistically and theoretically below average every time you see one they are really good thats because the only ones who keep playing it are the diehard fans the guys who know their class because its their main and they refuse to quit
wow,not_removed,must be some pretty bad prot pallies if you cant keep them healed were the absolute easiest tank class to play
wow,not_removed,a pug dh tank is my ultimate nightmare there is a hell be the best tank you ever healed and then will be decent then you have the that hell be whyareyousoslowhealer tank who will be yards away from you always while you struggle pushing every cd you have to get to him and keep him alive until you just give up and let him die until he ether understand or leave and get a new tank
wow,not_removed,tanking as a dh is easy but if you are even just a little bit undergeared you are blown out easily
wow,not_removed,protection pally issues what are they ilvl
wow,not_removed,whenever i am tanking on my dh his os i never die and i pull like a mofo just get them facing you and try to maintain demon spikes picking up soul shards with the cleave thingy when you cant
wow,not_removed,were you greated with shock
wow,not_removed,well now i have to take it down
wow,not_removed,they seem more confusedworried then when we started also no idea how or when you flow to the boxes on the lower left
wow,not_removed,lol sorry for my english
wow,not_removed,thanks
wow,not_removed,the dk one is spot on if you can translate it to freedom speech
wow,not_removed,there are dozens of us dozens
wow,not_removed,hoping thats a good thing lol
wow,not_removed,when i get home im going to post my tell me when profile i know its gross because its not weak auras but that could save you some time if you wanted
wow,not_removed,i have a ton already if i can figure out how to make an export string after i get home tonight ill post it
wow,not_removed,if you ever do i have a tell me when i made that will hold your hand until you get the hang of it basically used it to write up this thing lol updated
wow,not_removed,ironskin brew when youre going to get hurt purifying brew when youve been hurt and have high health expel harm when youve been hurt and are on low health fortifying brew if you reach point and youre still in trouble now you can tank okay up to dungeon finder heroics
wow,not_removed,joking aside just follow the beer expel harm charts and you will be fine
wow,not_removed,that is a clefairy you swine
wow,not_removed,clefairy im only
wow,not_removed,cant mess up laser bear anyway 😄
wow,not_removed,no worries i actually have all of this handled with a tell me when profile i set up it accounts for a lot of different things and makes adjustments to priorities based off of talent options only the viable ones though i havent bothered adjusting it to playstyles i dont use ill make a brief video and post the profile when i get home tonight should help a lot of people out
wow,not_removed,i think you have to practice enough to be able to make strategic decisions instead of watching ability cooldowns and panicking healer mana and raid health looks good im going to lean on the healers now okay healers are getting busy im going to use some brews low on brews healths low grab healing orbs and think about a cooldown healers arent busy now low on brews lean on the healers for a bit
wow,not_removed,at end of wod brewmaster had a brokenly strong mechanic when coupling their set bonus with vengeance baseline for all tanks and guard essentially having a shield of their maximum health every seconds with charges guard also increased healing received by and they had stagger baseline that could be purified for the full amount this made brewmaster very popular legion scrapped guard and vengeance mechanic they shifted all of the mitigation onto proper stagger management and introduced brew charges as the primary resource staggered damage is still damage taken it isnt actually mitigated until it is purified so sites like warcraft logs that show tank comparisons will always show monks as taking the most damage people see this and think that the monk is the worst tank because of all the damage they take but they ignore things like celestial fortune that has a chance based on the monks crit rating to cause a heal to be amplified by making a simple hot able to maintain a monk that is taking stagger damage in essence insanely easy playstyle being converted into a rather different playstyle upset the masses the combination of warcraft logs not having a good way to account for stagger and the wod playerbase being upset made a lot of people scared to play brewmaster the class isnt in a good spot by any means as an example a lot of the artifact traits are useless however things arent as bad as people make them out to be im probably going to get yelled at for being wrong with this analysis but from what ive seen this seems to be the main reasoning for it
wow,not_removed,this is the highest compliment i could receive
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,the link in the description is the most up to date version of the weak auras the video shows how it all works its tellmewhen though
wow,not_removed,mine was at least some what informative
wow,not_removed,brewmaster here the chart is accurate but doesnt go into detail on several things wat is probably the right reaction if you havent looked into brewmaster tanking before
wow,not_removed,yes
wow,not_removed,hey we need shield slam to generate rage too
wow,not_removed,yeahgoing from spam jones blast everything hit fist on keyboard prot paladin that has million oh shit buttons to total oh shit buttons that are situationalfortifying and zen love the playstyle though especially paralysis on pesky mobs and leg sweep for the big pulls
wow,not_removed,i started leveling a brm but i never generated more than healing orbs i died on single mobs since i simply ended up healing myself using effuse or whatever its called there were no healing orbs at all do they scale with gear im and only like ilvl since i used invasions to level to and forgot to save my invasion reward pieces
wow,not_removed,shhhh if people start playing the class theyll reduce its complexity for class fantasy
wow,not_removed,yeah i run blackout combo as well feels mandatory really but adding when to pause stagger and when to empower everything else would have added so much extra work to this flow chart i kind of slapped it together for shits and giggles more than accurate tanking perfection lol
wow,not_removed,it actually complete changes your flow because once you break haste bos is available every other cast or close to it sometimes you want to double tiger strike just to get brews back faster being able to pause your stagger damage can be absolutely huge theres so much utility you get out of boc i dont know if i can ever play my brm without it maybe if i get the bof reset legendary i would part of the appeal boc is getting higher breath uptime for more nonstaggered mitigation
wow,not_removed,dont you need haste for that tough i was told to take high tolerancethe one that gives you haste for stagger if you dont have haste
wow,not_removed,i sometimes heal on my druid for satchels or just faster queues and i feel like a brewmaster is exactly the kind of tank im looking for burst always stresses me out
wow,not_removed,so a slow painful collapse versus exploding
wow,not_removed,thats literally what he said lol
wow,not_removed,druids are every brewmasters favorite just relax with a few hots paladins are by far my least favorite all the direct heals that either go to waste or come in too late not that they cant heal me fine but its a lot less relaxing than druid shamans and priests are both great too but not to the level of druid
wow,not_removed,silly dhthere are often times it feels like i could solo him
wow,not_removed,headless horseman dungeon gives bags
wow,not_removed,if only blizzard followed through with some of the legion changes they initially released characters can queue up as any role that is available to their class and will automatically switch to the suitable specialization when entering the dungeon raid battleground or arena without any gold cost for example a paladin might be questing as retribution but queue up in dungeon finder as a tank when the paladin enters the dungeon they will automatically switch to protection original copy of source current changed source they probably scrapped that idea when they went through with the multispec thing which doesnt make sense since this auto spec dungeon thing was a great qol change for anyone queueing as more than one spec whether or not we can change freely
wow,not_removed,my last hh run i went in as holy pally and got on meters that was in front of the tank and a warlock
wow,not_removed,headless horseman
wow,not_removed,theres dozens of us or so ive been told so far only met one other and its his off spec
wow,not_removed,im usually floating around dalaran on area trying to convince people that we can be viable
wow,not_removed,the best thing ever no matter what its also i think i saw one once
wow,not_removed,had no problems healing a hov with a brewmaster tank not sure if that counts as high level but if not i dont know what is
wow,not_removed,if you have a huge damage intake you will run out of mitigation and require a lot of healing thats just the way tanks are designed and isnt unique to brewmasters you just have to mitigate what you can
wow,not_removed,only if a youre shit which a lot of brews are or b youre not stacking enough haste
wow,not_removed,thats like the opposite of what happened with dhs this expansion
wow,not_removed,thats me
wow,not_removed,that would be me if i didnt have to heal for mythics i still will consider myself a brm main though even if i wind up healing on my priest the entire expansion lol its by far my favorite spec in the game and i miss it every day
wow,not_removed,problem with prot palas and dhs and dks is that they have spikey selfheal so if they drop below chances are the healer wants to top them off with cd or big heal and they use their own healing abilities at the same time causing a bunch of overheal and a missing cd from the healer then when they drop below again shortly afterwards both parties are without cds and pants are being shat
wow,not_removed,a lot of prot pallies are silly squishy for some reason then you find the ones that know what theyre doing and i can just shockadin the rest of the heroic
wow,not_removed,easy to play and easy to heal dont go hand in hand i main hpal and os prot and from experience of both playing and healing them theyre not my favorite by any means
wow,not_removed,its not that i cant keep them healed its that it always feels as if they have active mitigation same thing with dhs i have my artifact at level now from the massive amount of m ive pugged ranging from and dhs or prot pallies feel by far the squishiest at least dhs you can find some that are crazy good and near invincible but ive cant recall one single prot pally who impressed me i am a pretty good healer too if i do say so myself i also raid with one if you have any tips for me to help give him
wow,not_removed,were the absolute easiest tank class to play swipe mangle swipe damagereduction repeat sometimes lasers
wow,not_removed,sounds like you need leap of faith
wow,not_removed,its easy for tank but horror for healer
wow,not_removed,also dont underestimate the barrier talent holy shit that thing is a lifesaver
wow,not_removed,all thats running through my head are sweer potatoes french fried and chicken nuggers
wow,not_removed,just say you were drunk while making it
wow,not_removed,i feel the same even though it doesnt go into detail that you need to combo the everlivingshit with blackoutstrike the beerchart is really nice if you dont quite know how to handle brews
wow,not_removed,not op but that sounds really useful im very interested in brm tanking loving the monk this expansion so far
wow,not_removed,clefairy sez was my shit back in the day
wow,not_removed,just goes to show how horrible my memory is
wow,not_removed,that makes sense thank you
wow,not_removed,thats my understanding i would go further and say that brewmaster is the hardest tank to play by a large margin its legendaries are arguably the most impactful of all the tanks meaning we scale better were the only tank i believe or is it us and dks that also doesnt stack versatility so we naturally get hit harder i put it in quotes because its complicated i can at least say this having played vengeance guardian and brm at on live prot warrior and blood dk on beta i didnt touch prot paladin resident sleeper brm was easy and amazing in wod to the point of being trivial now they have to work harder than the other tanks to get the same performance there are loads of things people forget about on brm though that makes them super good for mythic aoe stun super high mobility great snap aggro all come to mind as excellent tools for dealing with mythic content when it comes to raiding were great at eating a really big hit because it gives the healer more time to respond at least on normal cenarius his spear phase was a joke to deal with on a brm because stagger didnt make the puddle get bigger meaning that puddle barely grew when it was me tanking him
wow,not_removed,the only thing id say about this is that while brewmaster was more popular in wod than it is now i dont think at any point in its lifespan could it be classified as popular i could be wrong on that but that is what ive always heard otherwise yea you are mostly on with what you said they are actually not in a bad spot at all they just fall behind when you compare it to the top right now warrior paladin and druid all which seem to perform a full step above the other tanks
wow,not_removed,youre not wrong but yeah theyre also not completely unplayable crap ive posted several times about whats wrong with brewmasters despite the things that are fucked up with them i still enjoy them i will admit that im windwalker main though but i tank of the dungeons i go into ive been monk since mop came out and enjoyed it their biggest problems are like you said the artifact is pretty shit overall even the artifact skill is lousy it doesnt affect spells doesnt affect special attacks its high damage so thats nice but on a skill with so few actual damage reduction abilities it really shouldve been something a lot better designed like if it gave the old dizzying haze effect at a higher chance for a longer period of time the other thing is just how shitty ironskin brew and purifying brew interact i dont get why they changed purifying brew so much when in its old incarnation it would work perfectly with the current ironskin brew it should either stay how it is but have separate stacks from ironskin brew maybe reduced to two charges or something so were not just beerchugging lunatics that take damage or continue to share stacks but go back to purifying of stagger it just feels so piddly and shitty right now that it makes the whole spec feel like its a table with leg shorter than the rest almost stable and fine and totally usable but occasionally the table tilts in one direction and makes a loud bump noise and there goes another glass of water
wow,not_removed,yes of course like every one of those
wow,not_removed,we get a lot of nuance in our talent choices too they change the flowchart quite a bit
wow,not_removed,i havnt and never realized it was this in depth
wow,not_removed,upvoted for shamelessness
wow,not_removed,how can you forget revenge and thunder clap we are so good at aoe
wow,not_removed,dont forget exploding keg seconds of melee attacks missing can matter a lot also leg sweep and your level talent
wow,not_removed,they scale with damage taken unless you have a healer and youre getting trucked think bosses you will spawn almost no orbs
wow,not_removed,the orbs are meant to be pooled and used as a healing cooldown when you have a batch of them and are at low health they do not produce enough selfhealing to compensate for incoming damage but their frequency scales with incoming dps basically one orb per health bar worth of incoming damage prior to stagger so you barely see any while soloing but youll get a ton of them when tanking a raid boss or a mythic
wow,not_removed,dude you are very very badly undergeared even if you could kill something it would take you years to finish a quest what server are you on
wow,not_removed,orbs spawn whenever you would take of your life as damage whether this damage is mitigated flat or staggered is irrelevant so you could take of your life in damage of that damage as stagger and through mitigation and spawn an orb you also get a free orb at health essentially if you follow the beer chart and your rotation you should see your first orb around life when you hit this marker you will use your first charge of healing elixer this will boost you back to unless it crits as you get more gear your crit will increase and you should end up back to full from this eventually you will be back at health again adn get your second orb you can now use expel harm to repeat the cycle then at the next point you will use healing elixir againsince it will be charged again and just complete the cycle this assumes youre not taking insane damage if you were then after dropping below life you would pool and then use expel harm at
wow,not_removed,im at base haste without food buff oh something on keg smash cd took it out for a spin on mythic mos sanguine fingers felt like i was playing a guitar solo the whole way through goddamn i loved every second of it
wow,not_removed,i really wish boc was baseline makes the brm flow how it should
wow,not_removed,i dont have much haste at all if i remember correctly i have haste mastery with food as a panda crit i run black out combo and obey the beer and expel harm chart to the letter never feel squishy mastery being so high coupled with beer stache dodge for seconds and baseline dodge from agility gear i basically dodge every other attack my crit is nearly so when i charge an expel harm it nearly always crits adn when i have multiple hots rolling they do as well i dont know what you should do but i feel like blackout combo is the way the spec was meant to be played regardless of your stat weights
wow,not_removed,blackout combo is a somewhat problematic talent in its base form its actually pretty weak for survivability unless you can get high hot blooded uptime out of it but once youve got high haste youll have trouble finding the gcds to fit breath of fire in without sacrificing other parts of your rotation even then it significantly complicates tanking mechanics without seeming superior to the alternatives i suspect it was originally meant as a dpsoriented alternative similar to seraphim for protection paladins and only accidentally became competitive with the other talents in general blizzard tries to keep tanking rotations pretty simple because tanks have other things on their plate and options that complicate tanking rotations or add damage are generally meant for more offensive play
wow,not_removed,i love love love love resto druid specifically because all i need is rejuv germination half the time and im gucci i can just use expel harm out of that holy paladins are funny because holy shock crits celestial fortunte massive overhealing even if i am at health priest can basically just use holy words to heal me and smite spam outside of that disc priest is nice because their healing in just by doing damage tends to also be enough w expel harm resto shaman is nice because they can comfortably let me drop low mistweaver much like druid can just hot me and then go fistweave because ill be fine suddenly jade serpent statue becomes the best mistweaver talent because its all i need that constant stream of healing p
wow,not_removed,agreed so so much i main spec resto but when a tank like a dh dk or even paladins cant keep from hitting burst damage i always get super annoyed because they dont seem to understand that things just go to shit from them on it takes one dps not paying attention and getting knocked down to and i cant get to them because im busy bitch healing the tank something ive learned though healing mythic is to accept that i cant and shouldnt keep everyone topped up unless burst damage is about to happen or a fuck up from someone can kill them last boss of brh comes to mind where shadow bolt volley always comes right before the first musical chairs ill get to you when i can once i get the tank stable
wow,not_removed,you can seefeel it miles away its painful when this happens i tend to quote my guild spriest okay im going to die now
wow,not_removed,there are about stages health you gradually fall to life then hit the expel harm wall and blast back to full life health you got knocked past the first threshold and have some stagger to deal with but you still fall down to at the same pace around that point you have about orbs and if they crit you get shot back to full health on your own accord anything sub youre kind of in fight for your life mode with constant orb procs whenever you dip below health that one orb is usually only good for health gain because rngesus hates you so you end up having seizure as you spam the hell out of expel harmisbpurify and then one of them overflows and crits and suddenly you are at full life again or you didnt get healed past from it cant foritfy to boost yourself back to and you die
wow,not_removed,yeah but this is reddit
wow,not_removed,ohhh im dumb thought he meant random heroic its late and im stupid sorry
wow,not_removed,yeah its nice to make stuff go so fast as an hpal
wow,not_removed,holy paladins do pretty legit damage its awesome
wow,not_removed,go disc pop pi when someone lusts top damage and healing meters
wow,not_removed,weirdly i ran into another one in an arena of all places both our partners died and we had a minute stalemate fight
wow,not_removed,just queue into or theyre usually desperate for a decent tank and very quickly realize that you were the correct choice
wow,not_removed,dks and dhs give me heart attacks id take a brew
wow,not_removed,not considered high level till you get to the affix p
wow,not_removed,im doing regularly now still only with pugs though shameless recruit me group plug i only have about haste too and just run with as much mastery and crit as i can manage following that beer chart and occasionally using blackout combo to freeze stagger makes brew management not an issue and damage intake smooth as silk its just really jarring to wrap your head around initially but once it clicks there is no stress healing a brewmaster
wow,not_removed,this is not true bearsironfur warriorsshield block can keep their mitigation up of the time without burning their cds outside of isbpuri brew which you need to rotate constantly and run out of they only have fortifying brew on a cd
wow,not_removed,happens every time a new class is introduced especially if they start near level cap happened during wrath with dks and again in mop with monks although the monk influx was much smaller than the dk or dh one due to lower sub numbers and having to level them all the way up
wow,not_removed,there are dozens of us i tell you
wow,not_removed,priest why not play your brm as mw im ms heals and switching from priest to monk for legion was the best decision ive ever made in the game
wow,not_removed,this is why i have explained the healer we run m with i tank m with my dh that keep an eye on my hp and my pain bar and dont panic if my hp drops to a safe percentage for example while i have a lot of pain waiting to be used as i can prob back myself up to a healty percentage he was panicing a lot at the start of our m runs but as we ran more and more dungeons he got used to the flow of my selfhealing
wow,not_removed,i never really run into that problem honestly i only raid or do mythics with my guild healers and they know when i cant bounce back on my own and theyre more than capable of giving me the boost that i need to recover
wow,not_removed,yah just got to find good ones i raid rankd all of heroic no problem but then some people have problems just playing tanks
wow,not_removed,a lot of tanks are super squishy if they dont know what theyre doing im not fond of how they made threat basically not a thing anymore but i do like how much control a tank has over his own survival i find that a dead tank is pretty rarely the healers fault unless he just wasnt healing
wow,not_removed,if they dont have hand of the protectorrighteous protector their self healing isnt very good if they have both they will have silly self healing when theyre low also if you dont see spinny hammer thats going to be more auto attack damage theyre taking and all sorts of other little things you can build a prot pally like a brick house or you can build them as an aoe murder machine some people queue dungeons as aoe murder machines
wow,not_removed,its because theyre blowing sotr on cool down not healing properly and not standing in consecrationkeeping it up bad tanks are reaaaalllly bad now
wow,not_removed,quick tips dont heal them a good prot pal dont need much heal except if he is getting absolutely destroyed by the boss ursoc and the like
wow,not_removed,strange the healers in my guild love bringing my prot paladin along for m runs due to the fact that i require much less healing when compared to our other tanks in raid i require about as much external healing when compared to the other tank on pretty much every fight excluding ursoc
wow,not_removed,if youre topping him off all the time he will have selfhealing in the mean time track a prot paladins damage taken sometime it should be tiny high block high armor sotr giving high dr
wow,not_removed,people flip out if i use life grip on them and it is a pug the only time i use it is if some dps pulls an extra mob and the tank goes to pull a new pack i will grip the tank so he becomes aware of the situation before he might make it worse
wow,not_removed,there just arent any external queues for when were okay or not we see a stack of five orbs and know we can regen a bucket of health but our healers just see half hp and dipping
wow,not_removed,spikes whats spikes i can just aoe this shit and the healer will cover my ass right
wow,not_removed,if youre a newbie brewmaster you have no business playing the spec on hard mode youll screw up blackout combo often enough that youre better off taking something else
wow,not_removed,same lol have fun with it
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,when i get home from work ill send you a link to the paste bin
wow,not_removed,updated the parent to this comment with link
wow,not_removed,you probably werent very good at that mini game then d
wow,not_removed,overflow skittish and volcanic are all essentially ignored because of the way brews operate its great
wow,not_removed,for most of the tank specs which secondary to get comes down to partly the damage pattern of the fight bursty tank crusher mastery or slow dot versatility and partly their personal preference on playstyle
wow,not_removed,as somebody that has an brewmaster and an guardian druid i feel i am rewarded more on the druid for less effort and even at equal effort the monk does not reward me more i pull far more dps on the druid i have a larger health pool to soak damage with and not need healing my mitigation ranges from physical reduction on the druid where it sits at on monk stagger and yet i still take that damage where as on the druid it just disappears the druid has healing that is based and scales based on damage taken i once had a second heal that did of my health bar when i tank on the monk i watch my health tick tick tick down as i have no way of pulling it back up until and in groups i cant seem to tank massive amounts of mobs as the stagger gets out of control the normal mitigation on both not hitting something sucks because you arent getting more active mitigation out but when i dont hit anything on my druid i feel ok i know i have barkskin or just my health to survive where as on the monk i feel like my mitigation seconds from now is extremely suffering the more i play the druid the more i miss roll and the aoe stun but i still have an aoe incapacitate for interrupts that is all i miss i really enjoy brewmaster i just wish it was more in line with other tanks in terms of reward i like both though which is great for me
wow,not_removed,if they reverted purifying brew to how it was in the past my health wouldnt budge lol if we had a means to deal with magic damage outside of xen med very few times can i channel xen med and not get meleed by some add i think the class would be in a nicer place my suggestion would be changing the dragon fire artifact perk to grant an anti magic shield equal to of our life not much but enough to do something about magic damage when coupled with the stagger reduction trouble with balancing brew is just how strong stagger can actually be when managed correctly if we get too many defensive buffs in addition to our stagger then well be an unstoppable force in the right hands
wow,not_removed,eh you just need rage and ignore pain
wow,not_removed,you dont revenge unless there are enough targets to proc revenge near the icd you need to put bleed on multiple targets or you are trying to deal damage to groups of mobs on single target you generate more rage by keeping ss on cd and spamming devastate for resets
wow,not_removed,didnt revenge get the blood dk nerf treatment at launch
wow,not_removed,dragon roarwhy
wow,not_removed,i know its wrong but i pretty much use exploding keg on cooldown to see that beautiful particle effect
wow,not_removed,sohow do you solo it seems really strange my other characters can selfheal enough to just keep going on regular mobs
wow,not_removed,actually thats one of the reasons i like the ww too but youre totally right you start doing little patterns with your fingers wo thinking i love mw right now too feels like a dance while youre healing
wow,not_removed,i think one of the common fixes i see people suggesting is to make blackout combo be baseline and throw something else in the last tier i agree though i think bc makes it much more fun and intriguing playstyle
wow,not_removed,please stop telling people that boc is mandatory or even feels mandatory the few of us brms doing mythic progression will disagree as both other talents outperform in raiding and high m also obstinate determination is not mandatory either that is an outdated way of brewmastering from wod that doesnt translate well to this expac i see the talk on the forums and reddit alike the popular uninformed float around hp meme
wow,not_removed,i main disc but also have a monk as my secondary character who i mostly go brewmaster with these days i also have another monk i play with regularly who sometimes tanks as brm when im healing i do agree that disc and brm go great together i just shield on cd and keep atonement going and then dps its usually enough for all but the biggest bursts
wow,not_removed,the worst feeling is when dps suddenly take huge damage get to and you know aoe dmg is incoming well of you will live
wow,not_removed,versus the yoyo of death that is dk im good wait no crap nevermind im good oh sht spamming deathstrike its ok panic is over aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah catching breath whew that was close repeat this for minutes
wow,not_removed,i get that sometimes on my paladin especially in m my friends get a kick out of it cause ive gotten to the point where i can call it very accurately okay prep a brez im gonna die in seconds splat
wow,not_removed,sounds pretty resilient actually managed well it should be i do get the sense its a lot to juggle all of that plus managing mobs or bosses
wow,not_removed,ive run with geared paladins on cos runs one did dps on the final boss the other one did dps on him wut
wow,not_removed,i love brm the only issue with higher mythics are you get serious damage spikes i find myself using my fortifying brew way more than my iron skin brew
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,amen nothing stresses me out more as hpriest than spamming flash healserenity on cd just to keep a dkdh afloat waiting to see them use a cd that will give me a gcd i can use on the other party members that are getting wrecked because i feel like i cant spare a single cast without letting the tank get dangerously lowdead
wow,not_removed,im running haste and while i havent gotten to take my brm through much mythic content yet courtesy of being bitch slapped into healing on my priest i just dont find myself running out of brews running black out combo generally the only time i tend to go actually out of brew i have isb rolling until i can get a brew back and generally my stagger is managebale that low i kinda wanted to take my brm on heroic ursoc and see what that feels like as far as stagger goes
wow,not_removed,its not an all or nothing thing though stagger is a passive isb makes it stronger exploding keg and zen meditation are mitigation cooldowns yes theyre situational but they can be quite powerful you also have healing elixir diffuse magic and dampen harm to choose from healing elixir isnt mitigation but a heal that automatically procs when you hit health is pretty handy edit people often dont realise but fortifying brew is a brew and is affected by the brew cooldown reduction on keg smash and tiger palm it says minutes but winds up being available again after to minutes
wow,not_removed,we are few and we are strong
wow,not_removed,we already have a mistweaver so its hard to justify me going on mistweaver over me playing my priest particularly with how strong holy is for spot healing and the ability to flex me over to disc as needed
wow,not_removed,so palas should avoid being healed by anything other than their guild healers seems good
wow,not_removed,right just like how my brm never runs into problems when im running with my pocket healers because they know to ask if i have expel harm up before they panic i tell them when to panic in a pug ive gotten raged at before because why are you taking all this extra damage after fight i cant top you off well yes of course its stagger and its okay if i pull at hp my goal is to dip under lol
wow,not_removed,why shouldnt you use all shor charges immediately on trash
wow,not_removed,thank is fotm this expansion solo content is so amazingly better as a tank that a lot more people are rolling them my well geared enh shaman still is basically playing rocket tag ill kill you in seconds but if i dont im dead while my ok geared tankadin is just lol i pull everything they both will probably finish the wq in about the same time frame but its just so much easier on the tankadin just going through my basic rotation while the shaman is blowing cds taking time to self heal using stuns its a fucking dps cd now fucking ring etc
wow,not_removed,i agree with blizz that threat as a mechanic is kinda meh either you have sufficient threat or your dps have to slow down and thats just not fun
wow,not_removed,i really hate healing them they not only spike like stupid they also end up falling over havent healed too many though prot pala seems unpopular in my realm pool
wow,not_removed,people are still adjusting to triage paladins much like brm sit at lower health but are stable at lower health points its very uncomfortable as a healer seeing your tank at hp but with both pally and brm thats when they are at their tankiest
wow,not_removed,ive had to use it a lot with the burrowing worms in neltharions a lot of new tanks dont understand that burrowing doesnt mean its dead and have to be gripped onto them to deal with them and of course dhs that are just having too much fun being the fastest goddamn things ever and leaving the rest of the party in the dust
wow,not_removed,you are really suprised that with all the shit droping around between dodging skills healbot saving ass of other morons in party i have time track dh with all of his i fucking jumping allover the place skill and first to see and count a orbs im simple man when i cant predict flow of healing the tank because i got many too many oh shit moments i dislike healing that class
wow,not_removed,cues a queue is something you dont have for heroic dungeons as a tank
wow,not_removed,im weird in that brewmaster didnt click for me until i moved to blackout combo but i completely agree blackout combo takes the combo part very seriously and it no longer becomes just knowing when to isb when to purify and when to expel but you get the extra layer of having to learn your combos and whens the right time to use which combo in addition to no longer being able to spam your buttons because you might accidentally soft queue yourself into the wrong combo
wow,not_removed,just another player learning brm that would love to see this my group got crushed in last night and while it wasnt my fault entirely i know i can definitely improve this seems like it would help thanks
wow,not_removed,also also interested in this please share
wow,not_removed,interested in having this as well
wow,not_removed,er except versatility performs extremely well to the point of crowding out other secondaries across the board on paladin druid warrior and demon hunter dk its okay on haste is way too valuable on monk to stack anything else over it until you get dr
wow,not_removed,youre doing something very wrong on your monk if your druid is doing more damage thats straight up not mathematically possible if youre playing both at efficiency unless were talking about massive aoe pulls when you say not hitting something are you talking about not pushing a button because if you dont have a button to push on your monk you did something wrong also frenzied regen has pretty decent downtime on it it is awesome when youre able to regen a big hit though i will definitely give you that i would definitely agree on the whole that outside of dps you are rewarded more for doing less on druid its pretty faceroll to play i got bored of guardian very quickly its what made me want to move to brewmaster in the first place i couldnt deal with the colossal boredom that was druid tanking i think in general my issue this expansion is blizzards riskreward is pretty poor because they want every spec to be viable that means specs that are inherently harder to play cant have too much of a reward over other specs so while i think theres probably still room to give brm a little more lovin youre never going to find them massively overperforming compared to the other tanks in spite of being quite significantly more difficult to play
wow,not_removed,yeah sorry i shouldve clarified that i meant how purifying used to cleanse stagger not how it was a tiny cooldown chi though i wouldnt mind being an invincible tank again i also miss shuffle and elusive brew and ohgod do i miss the brew that broke stunfear effects despite how complicated brewmasters are all the depth is just in controlling stagger damage it just feelsoff i guess its not terrible just not very good either its like thats all we do control stagger i wish we could do more defensively from a mechanics standpoint thats what was nice about guard even if it was a little weird to balance it was a fun mechanic that added to the playstyle same with elusive brew really not a fan of how it became the weird passive mastery we got instead sure it can be strong but it doesnt feel like youre doing anything and yeah most of all they need to change the artifact weapon because holy shit the brewmaster traits are bad i charted it out last week to give as an example to someone and showed there were only like or actual defensive traits in the entire tree then some junk that affects shield wallbrew really really weird design they went with for the brm artifact upside is at least the actual appearance is pretty nice i think our hidden is hideous but i like all the other looks we have got any nice transmogs you use im always on the lookout for good ones to change it up
wow,not_removed,is there a flowchart of war tank
wow,not_removed,until ss colldown is less than seconds where you hit revenge for the extra rage and after the gcd ss into revenge spam
wow,not_removed,i dunno i didnt really prot in wod
wow,not_removed,if watching beer explode is wrong i don´t wanna be right
wow,not_removed,i use it for snap threat or at the beginning of big pulls you can pretty effectively use it on cooldown or within seconds of coming off cooldown though great animation love the needlessly slow travel time too makes it almost comical when it comes crashing down lol
wow,not_removed,get the obstinate determination trait once you reach you become unkillable since you spawn orbs on no cds every time you health dips under it its actually pretty funny to see people try to kill me in world pvp and see my health get stuck at
wow,not_removed,effuse theres not a regular elite mill health variety i havent been able to solo on either my brm or mw world bosses are another story monks have lots of ways of getting away too to heal quickly the brews are a bit confusing as to knowing when to use them especially with monk mechanics but purifying brew goes a long way while youre soloing to remove a large portion of damage
wow,not_removed,i dont i play windwalker solo
wow,not_removed,i know youre trying to learn how to brew but consider going ww until you get some more gear the spec has a decent amount of mitigation to it touch of karma is stupid good and the damage is really good for reference i just did the brewmaster artifact quest chain as windwalker and had a couple buttclenching moments but overall was super simple
wow,not_removed,i never mentioned that obstinate determination is mandatory all tier talents are viable different playstyles and different forms of content have different demands ive just always found myself coming back to boc to the point that it feels mandatory even though it isnt
wow,not_removed,haha yes every expansion i go through this horrible guilt phase when dps die and then eventually move toward wellat least one of you lived probably should have been paying attention to your feet a bit morebummer i was healing a eye last night one ranged kept eating the volcanic bursts and a melee straight up got one shot by ground slam on the first boss the group fell apart and the tank and i had a good laugh about it after
wow,not_removed,ive learned when playing my dk to just try to not worry until you proc purgatory thats when you start to feel sheer terror for a few reasons now you will actually die something in the fight actually managed to kill you already so it will probably happen again
wow,not_removed,you forgot the ahh i died woo purgatory
wow,not_removed,yeah it all sort of cycles smoothly gradually fall to break point one shoot back up gradually fall to break point two shoot back up what makes the brew so cool is that this scenario plays out regardless of incoming damage when played correctly youll always drop at the same rate just stagger will increase the higher the damage youre taking which could cause you to miss the different break points
wow,not_removed,dat holy shock damage
wow,not_removed,on some big pulls after mini boss of vault of wardens for example if i do all of the packs at once ill lead with a fort brew damage is always front loaded with trash so if i know a pull is going to hurt then leading with fort brew isnt a bad choice it comes off cooldown faster too with all the keg smashes going out lately though ive been hanging onto it for when i fall below health and my healing orbs arent able to get me back above the extra health it gives will push you back above the and allow for obstinate determination to get rolling again and usually is enough to get you back to sustainable levels of health another big thing is making use of kiting you dont need to take the mobs to china but you can bring them around the same distance as an efflorescence healing circle the snaresstuns you naturally pump out will make sure that at least half of the pack isnt hurting you thats something that we have that a lot of other tanks dont i didnt start making use of it until recently and its really made a world of difference
wow,not_removed,so my guild has a main and off tank already but i progress through mythic content now instead of through raids so when i do raid even though i wind walk i have my specialization locked into brew when one of our tanks doesnt show up i end up tanking and every healer breaths a little easier in whispers though were a casual guild so we want everyone to have fun and feel good as you probably already know the fight will dictate the level of stagger that you can maintain xavius and ursoc you kind of shift the easy purifies when you are about to regain a charge from you also let your health guide your decisions in terms of when to isb and purify raid healing is nice because celestial fortune procs off anyone so you can afford to float the extra stagger in mythic plus kiting and transcendence become a big deal hell even roll becomes a viable defensive since kegsmash debuff is up most mobs never really touch you its great with necrotic because you can kite long enough to reset your stacks
wow,not_removed,i play brm with the haste build for max uptime on isb and i still run out of brews sometimes when i have to use puri brew alot when going into red zone i always take healing elixir just because our self heals are pretty crappy without procing gift of the ox at health at health generally using expel harm will give you a large burst heal which is great
wow,not_removed,the few the drunk the brewmasters
wow,not_removed,oh i see i dont know if i could do that now that ive seen the light id be like but mistweavers is fine i promise and just in case you ever need me to tank ill already be geared up
wow,not_removed,well if he is good he wouldnt know just how bad other people at his role could be if you never actively pug anything how can you get an idea of how the general player base plays their classes at least he admits he couldnt know because he only plays with guildies
wow,not_removed,if youre managing stagger proper you should be able to reliably have charges of expel harm around marker if you pop them then you should be able to top yourself off when you are sub life unless you have charges of expel harm thats when you want to bank it until you hit health to shoot back to full but if you have those charges you can save your healer the heart attack and pop them early i usually always pug so i figured out some of the break points on when to expel harm
wow,not_removed,sotr also reduces incoming dmg for x seconds if you blow through the charges up front for threatdmg youre also eating up all your time to reduce incoming dmg yes the reduced dmg buff stacks but the charges wont refresh in time before the buff ends also since it is off the gcd you can use it anytime you want like prepping for incoming dmg spikes between consecrate being setforget spinny hammers of doom and frisbeefrisbee procs theres plenty of on demand aoe dmg and threat tools not so much with dmg mitigation eye of tyr short duration shortmedium cooldown ardent defenderancient kings both short duration longish cooldowns
wow,not_removed,my guess would be to spread the mitigation across the trash pull on mythics etc
wow,not_removed,because then youre squishy
wow,not_removed,lol try telling the shadow priest at stacks to slow down they can slow down alright so slow you might think theyre dead
wow,not_removed,whats the reasons behind them being at their tankiest is it a reduced dmg at or below x skillpassivetalent or is it bc they have self healing abilities that can pull them out of trouble if needed just wondering as i main a h pally and tank from time to time i know my tank can bounce back fairly quickly once i drop too low but in the back of my mind i wanna see myself get back up to fullnear full
wow,not_removed,well if its a m i dont really recall ever having a tank forget about them or its too low of a key for the damage of them to really matter if its a heroic ill kill them myself most of my time spent in those is with dps trinkets on and spamming holy nova anyway but i spend most of my pug time in only hov because of all the crit mastery gear
wow,not_removed,no i mean other players literally cant see the orbs lol
wow,not_removed,ehhh i had just woken up thank you though
wow,not_removed,i was in the process of making one but it didnt need to be as detailed as the beer one so i just attached it to the main flow chart expel harm is off the global cooldown though so if you are lazy you could bind every ability to use expel harm on cast if you wanted lol bad idea with things like over flow and the like but having purify brew auto cast expel harm is okay ish
wow,not_removed,updated the parent to this comment with link
wow,not_removed,sure ive since updated it to revise the expel harm and purifyisb timings its a lot more stable now plus bosses dont chunk me nearly as hard after i made those changes lol
wow,not_removed,updated the parent to this comment with link
wow,not_removed,updated the parent to this comment with link
wow,not_removed,ill just put my responses into numbers based on paragraph here mostly aoe almost everything i do is aoe pulls when comparing they both end up around the same single target druid being slightly higher i can tell you already what i have done wrong in this case and it is not having blackout combo if i ever step away from a boss all i have to do is keg smash which is used on cooldown other than that there is always something there to push but if i am running from pack to pack in a dungeon during that roll or during the run to the next pack i am not actively reducing my brew cooldowns ya i feel like if i actually pay attention to it the cooldown is nothing but if i get a bit spammy i find myself without self heals i love love love guardian for dungeons i am going to try taking lunar beam incarnation and brambles tonight for the giant lined up aoe fest of cooldowns expecting high numbers on the note of boring i thought so at first too but galactic guardian and the mangle procs are what keeps it alive for me that plus guardian of elune and the artifact reduced rage cost thing just things to be looking for there just needs to be less risk involved in the brewmaster anything from increasing the amount of damage purified or giving us a better way to deal with healing orbs maybe not let them over heal or something to save some orbs on expel harm my ideal situation with the monk is just reducing the amount of damage we stagger and allowing purify to do of stagger
wow,not_removed,ive never disagreed with someone more to be honest lol tanking in general has always been boring make sure mobs hit you point mobs away dont die and if you are raiding swap at for the first time in a long time there is a class that requires some thought and micromanagement while still doing all the other tasks of a regular tank guard was hit and forget about it because it would last through the whole duration with stagger management its very reliant on personal judgement and the current situation yeah there are the different ideal moments to use isb or purify as i listed in the chart but the situation youre in will change where those moments land i will agree with you the mastery as strong as it is feels bland i do miss the elusive brew mechanic i knew what you meant with purify clearing stagger and i stand by what i said lol if i could clear of my stagger in go i would never die as for transmogs i mix and match all of my sets except for the new pvp tier set i actually like the whole thing so i use all of it the blue skin for the hidden artifact works well with the celestial agi cloak same colour scheme so start there and build off of that i dont like sharing my looks too much lol its about the only unique thing left to this game
wow,not_removed,not that ive seen but its literally just shield slam revenge shield block ignore pain filling any empty gcd with devastate and using thunder clap to pick up adds using cds when needed aka never oh and using intercept on an ally during boss fights whenever possible to generate extra rage
wow,not_removed,unless you get ccd around andor someone bursts you to the point where an orb cant heal you back above
wow,not_removed,maybe because im just ilvl but yeah i cant seem to live to regular mobs
wow,not_removed,windwalker has great aoe good single target and pretty good selfheal mitigation
wow,not_removed,yeah is the main reason im not super keen on that talent ive found that if i got knocked to that point where it kicked in chances are ive already blown through all my other cds and deathstrikes and even if the healer somehow miraculously brings me back im still deep in the poop
wow,not_removed,i did mythic hov this week and the poor dps were dead for half the dungeon it was just heals and me or just me self healing and aoe blasting us to victory the downside was we never killed odyn because of low dps
wow,not_removed,no joke just like a real bear oooooo that tickles tee hee
wow,not_removed,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i died woo purgatory seconds later aaaaaand im dead thanks purgatory
wow,not_removed,oops i meant purifying more than iron skin brewing but i see what youre saying we do have a good amount of stuns what do you primarily use for kiting if you dont mind me asking
wow,not_removed,also if you favor the haste playstyle i hear the break point is after that you should shift your focus towards mastery or crit i have dodge from my mastery plus the base line from gear and then an additional through the artifact when i drink a beer so i essentially dodge every other attack it kind of made the haste break point less appealing for me when i figured this out my crit is nearing too so celestial fortune procs whenever i stack an expel harm its very nice
wow,not_removed,haha thats awesome
wow,not_removed,you dont need to maintain isb uptime though isb by itself doesnt have any effect on your overall damage taken healers still need to heal through your stagger if you have high health and youre not planning on purifying soon go ahead and let isb fall off you wont get spiked from to zero and healers have to heal it either way also you dont have to purify when your stagger bar goes red if theres not much raid damage going out make the healers do some work or if youre taking a beating and have isb up let your stagger bar fill up more and purify when its as high as its going to get its important to know when to use your abilities ive found its important to know when not to use your abilities too im still working on that
wow,not_removed,honestly in hindsight i wish i had done that because now we need more tanks for man stuff lol and my poor little brewmaster is getting neglected im an altaholic so this expansion has been rough on me in general
wow,not_removed,hell at stacks he doesnt need to slow down fade will probably see him through to his death anyway
wow,not_removed,well i mean its different with prot paladins you dont really want to leave them at low hp its just that their selfhealing scales with missing health with brewmaster however they summon a healing orb with a chance of a super mega awesome orb of super duper healing every time they drop under hp with no icd on it yeah no icd at all so if a druid hots me and i keep getting autod down to hp and then hotted back up to and then autod back down im about to have all the healing orbs in the world available to me flipside is you have to be careful that there isnt a surprise hit for everything hard to do against brm but whatever when youre doing that system but when it comes to playing how low can you go brm generally wins
wow,not_removed,its mixture of talents and abilities our self heal does of missing health so when we are low its more efficient also once we hit hp we get faiths armor which gives us a pretty significant boost to our armor both of these help us stay tanky while our abilities such as sotr and ardent defender are either on cd or being saved for upcoming damage
wow,not_removed,largely because of this if you constantly top them off youre just reducing the effectiveness of their sustain
wow,not_removed,that sucks even a little bit more
wow,not_removed,id love this i fell in love and leveled as wind walker and am super interested in brew master if youd share id love you
wow,not_removed,definitely put it out for everyone if it trivialize the brew system it would go a long way for the class
wow,not_removed,looks awesome and crazy i need to work on better weakauras for mine or maybe ill try tell me when
wow,not_removed,see even with mangle procs galactic guardian its still just super boring for me i get why people enjoy it it just isnt my cup of tea druid in general isnt my cup of tea boomkin is the only spec i even enjoy a little bit on druid and its still bleh to me full moon is just always so satisfying
wow,not_removed,hey thats alright youre free to disagree with me its just how i feel about it im glad theres something in this damn game that requires thought i just feel like so much of the class is baked into one mechanic i mean for sure of all the tank specs ive tried out in legion brewmaster is the only one that feels like youve actually got shit to do i meant itd be nice if they couldve reworked guard and shuffle rather than flat out removing them itd give more tank mechanics to work with asis on my brewmaster i feel like a dps who has to fight against an infiniteduration dot rather than a tank
wow,not_removed,yes you are vastly undergeared for your level if youre entering into legion content and no doubt it is pretty rough id highly suggest that you follow your side allyhorde around and tag shit while they kill it you should be able to get to at least fairly quickly you could even act as just a meat shield taunt then spam effuse dont forget leg sweep either lol good luck
wow,not_removed,while pugging dungeons on my enhance shaman i saw our dk tank proc purgatory and started spamming surges on him until he was back to full we won that fight
wow,not_removed,so keg smash always snares and i try and take advantage of that as much as possible on pulls that i intend to kite i will drop a transcendence and when things get too hot i will roll out the mobs will slowly pursue me and when they catch up if i am not feeling safe i will transcendence back to where i was originally if that isnt good then i will stun and do the same the important thing to to keep keg smash active and when you can reapply breath of fire this will keep threat locked tightly to you
wow,not_removed,this is how im gearing too im trying to stack mastery and crit and letting the haste just fall where it wants i like the idea of dodging every other attack since i probably wont be raiding just doing mythic and kara
wow,not_removed,can you post your armory
wow,not_removed,learning when to sit on stagger was the biggest thing for me mastering that and effective transcendence use made a massive improvement for me when i was first starting
wow,not_removed,truth i feel i do a pretty good job of keeping my health at around around or better most of the time between isbpbeh but there are situations where i could stand to be less twitchy about mitigation and self heals at and operate more comfortably at health or so
wow,not_removed,got it makes sense now i know in case i ever run into a brm yeah the pally self heal scales with missing health so its much easier to come back once i get low vs just trying to top myself off
wow,not_removed,updated the parent to this comment with link
wow,not_removed,ill make a post with it when i get home tonight i sort of follow it religiously and ive gotten up to chests in my mythic plus dungeons every now and then i find myself doing something not listed so ill try and recreate the situation and then add it back into the profile its sort of evolved to the point where if your reactions are fast enough you dont even have to think about what spell you should be hitting instead you just worry about where to be standing
wow,not_removed,updated the parent to this comment with link
wow,not_removed,updated the parent to this comment with link
wow,not_removed,i can get that my big problem is trying to find a balance between a dps and tank spec that i enjoy so i can play both i love the brewmaster but windwalker just doesnt get my goat it is neat and does good dps but i hate the hit combo stuff feral and balance are alright i like guardian but dpsing in dungeon as boomy kills me a little bit inside
wow,not_removed,yeah simplifying just about everything this game has to offer which isnt entirely bad but as a tank i cant play any of the other classes right now pruned too much
wow,not_removed,yea i think purgatory is more of a healersgroups benefit than our own it gives the healer an oh shit timer where if they act fast enough it wont be a wipe versus having a dead tank and group wipe many a times this has been a life saver and with heals death strike heart strike healing it has saved me from many wipes in the past
wow,not_removed,good move by a utility dps but thing is thats what it can take to save a dk that hits that point the healer on their own may not be able to do it unless its a pally with loh
wow,not_removed,ahh makes sense so i was basically doing that aside from the use of transcendence and the constant rolling many thanks will give this a try now it sounds more promising than just remaining stationary and relying on brews more than anything
wow,not_removed,httpusbattlenetwowencharacterbleedinghollowclonksimple
wow,not_removed,this is what im working on i panic when i hit red stagger and immediately purify i have noticed that it usually happens when im already kind of low so its probably good that i did it but there have been a few times when i purified high stagger at high health and i probably could have saved it however i am running ed so i like purifying high stagger
wow,not_removed,some brms wont be comfortable floating quite that low for too long a lot of times when i am running with healers i know well and were on voice chat ill tell them when to let me drop and when to pick me up but do know that if you see a brm in the hp range you dont need to panic i would stick with casting holy light vs flash on brm in general and just save holy shocks for when things get ugly theres very few situations where you need to be casting your fast heal on a brm
wow,not_removed,yeah the pally self heal scales with missing health so its much easier to come back once i get low vs just trying to top myself off i dont tank for dungeons but i do use prot for withered training ive killed dro with withered before largely because hed get me down to health id burst back up to then hed whittle me back down just in time for the cooldown to finish
wow,not_removed,remindme hours
wow,not_removed,just be mindful of adds with cleave and cones also a lot of the melee will hate you if you take the mobs for big trips practice in proving grounds a bit and slowly work into kiting in smaller areas once you get confident with it youll see some big improvements
wow,not_removed,ed is the one that i have yet to play with it seems like it has a lot of potential though i should try and mess around with it but it completely changes my beer chart lol
wow,not_removed,yah probably would i used to use high tolerance and it felt horrible i wanted to stay away from blackout combo until i got more comfortable with the spec i switched to ed and it was night and day purifying feels really good and i feel much sturdier just my opinion though its probably objectively worse than blackout combo cause pausing stagger sounds op as fuck but i like keeping it a little simpler for now
wow,not_removed,lol wtf is this fron
wow,not_removed,kids
wow,not_removed,used to have an addon that did something like this plugin for titan bar i had it set to show my current spec and what gear set was equipped and later on what my current loot spec was set to until legion launched and it broke i never realized how much i relied on it been driving me nuts since it broke nice to have the auto gear swap back still catch myself going to manually swap gear sets when i change specs though
wow,not_removed,thanks man didnt know this
wow,not_removed,i just set this up on my druid last night and it is amazing over the years i kept trying to like the equipment manager but it was just too clunky to remember to swap things over whenever you switched specs this is wonderful now i wish there were a way to have it ignore the bulk of the slots so i only have to maintain the couple of trinkets and legendaries i actually swap around gear upgrades in a nonswapped slot break the set and you have to go in and update the set in both specs if its shared gear i tried using the ignore this slot option but that just made me naked aside from the trinkets and legendary for some reason when i switched specs
wow,not_removed,i was hoping thats what that meant but i wasnt sure
wow,not_removed,op is mvp right next to the legion flight whistle
wow,not_removed,fucking amazing holy shit i must of skipped that note somehowty for sharing d
wow,not_removed,never knew this existed thanks for letting me us know
wow,not_removed,gamechanger
wow,not_removed,while checking through the game files i found a game object titled which is a perfect chunk of the floor from inside the dungeon normally i would have skipped by it writing it off as just a prop used for the floor but a commontrend in the naming convention in world of warcraft game files is to use trapdoor for a part of the floor that is dynamic in some way checking further i noticed that it has an animation for opening i went into the dungeon to check and once i knew what i was looking for im amazed i didnt spot it before its quite clearly infront of the cell containing manastorm its at this point i was linked to a reddit post from a month ago and a matching forum post the comments are writing it off as part of the hunter campaign and im going to dispute that claim the part of the hunter campaign that requires you to go into violet hold takes place on another map which is a clone of violet hold but not the actual map itself this is important and ill get to why in a second in this map youll notice that suspicious floor chunk does not exist and it actually leads down into a room but said room isnt used here you never see the trapdoor exist on this map and it doesnt explode like in the animation this is half of why i am not willing to write it off as part of the hunter campaign the second part of my reasoning is that when the developers copy a map it does not include any doodads a doodad is a dynamic object thats not part of the terrain and generally has some kind of use ie interactable animates doors etc it strikes me that when the developer copied violet hold for this purpose the floor tile was lost youll also notice that the arcane buttons around the edges of the room are missing too back onto the topic of finding out what is below this door the footage linked in and shows a rogue shadowstepping down there by accident without realizing what is happening i have also managed to glitch down there its a small room with nothing inside of it why is this not discourging me because blizzard is not going to have whatever is supposed to be down there available to people who glitch down there without figuring out the trick once we figure out the trick im almost convinced that a the tiles will implode outward and b whatever secret is housed down there will spawn perhaps it is a hidden artifact perhaps one of the secrets that the developers keep teasing about on twitter we must figure this out httpiimgurcompmnazhfpng my theories that ive tested and did not work clicking all of the arcane defence buttons at the same time arcane mage abilities do not trigger it my untested theories the scarablike boss in there has an ability which forces a spike out of the ground infront of the tank as a tank ive never even remotely tanked the boss over there but im wondering if having a spike erupt on those tiles would cause it to pop open it would fit the animation well unlikely with the same concept as above someone mentioned a boss in there that uses shadow crash i dont believe this would fit because why would the tiles fly upward when hit from above still worth testing if the above does not work something to do with mages it seems magey mage mage mage
wow,not_removed,im fairly sure this was originally planned to be used on the end boss of vh but the idea was scrapped for whatever reasoning
wow,not_removed,all the icecrown citadel guys are in that dungeon its the frost dk artufact
wow,not_removed,i happened to fall down there too using my leap as a vengeance dh not sure if im being helpful but i wish
wow,not_removed,it could just be for something not yet implemented for example a new holiday boss in violet hold or just a quest with khadgar or one of the other archmages
wow,not_removed,maybe its a yettobeimplemented world quest rareboss has vh had one yet i know many of the other instances do
wow,not_removed,have you tried using skaggldrynk
wow,not_removed,upvoted for quality content especially the comment and its structure good job
wow,not_removed,since it seems to be near mrs manastorms cell maybe it has to do with the couple using the manastorm disguise toy turns you into millhouse and mrs manastorm will debuff you damage you and shrink your size if you use it before the encounter maybe a shrinked player can find an entrance there or somesuch
wow,not_removed,i had to go there for a quest i think it was with my rogue
wow,not_removed,suggestions off the top of my head monk exploding keg a set amount of damage has to be dealt to mobs above the door five warriors heroic leaping at least should manage to cast it without pathing errors engineering bombs shaman earthquakes
wow,not_removed,hey i actually managed to get there by complete accident i dced during boss fight and when i reconnected i was under the floor lol in an empty tunnel thank god we had warlock in our group and he summoned me
wow,not_removed,what about somehow using that potion from alchemy that makes you a meteor when you fall i figure it is worth a try
wow,not_removed,having a hunt around on my mage it is curious that the patch of floor is a different colour to the surrounding floor im wondering if maybe something will happen if arcane can cast mark of aluneth on the floor over it theres some toy or something i remember being able to cast it its name escapes me though
wow,not_removed,there was a post awhile back where a warrior charged and got taken down there i cant seem to find it right now but i dont remember it being anything interesting
wow,not_removed,in the first couple of days of i ended up down there when my finger slipped and i used the unseathing animation and the game crashed on me i just figured i somehow ended up in anubs cell or behind it i hearthed out and rejoined my group after checking out the crypt inside
wow,not_removed,its pretty clearly cut content they wanted you to go down there for the dungeon which was part of their marketed not just a rehashed violet hold
wow,not_removed,im surprised at all the hidden stuff that needs to be explored in legion grats to blizzard
wow,not_removed,hmm this is very interesting love shit like this maybe use the arcane crystals on a pack of mobs on the platform potentially several pulls on that same spot
wow,not_removed,yesterday i was glitched through the floor following a heroic leap attempt it appeared to be some sort of tomb looking room a short tunnel led into a rocky cave like room with spaces on the walls im unsure about anything else and my memory is failing me a little with the recollection of exactly what else i saw but i had to hearth fairly quickly because my group was upset i wasnt participating in trash lol
wow,not_removed,so i tried to get it with alt worked alt times and i glitched in then i tryed to get a better look we clicked allsome in order crystals but nothing happend or let the demons destroy the prison nothing happend but we have found a forever alone rat under the hold oo
wow,not_removed,i heard a rumor that mankriks wife is down there
wow,not_removed,i was doing my hunters final order hall scenario and it takes place in the violet hold in that version of it the floor is gone and its far easier to walk down therebut there is nothing there in the scenario
wow,not_removed,it is open for one of the hunter artifact quest instances i think i have hunter warrior and demon hunter at
wow,not_removed,i think we might have to use skaggldrynk to find more secrets in legion
wow,not_removed,im so here for magey mage mage mage goodness totally intriguing
wow,not_removed,if you want to explore this cave just while standing in the middle of the trapdoor you should be inside when you log in worked for me few times in normal difficulty and didnt on previously cleared mythic
wow,not_removed,the hunter order hall quests take you in there you fight some dude in violet hold and part of the quest makes you go down there if i remember nothing special edit remembering shit wrong gets you downvotes even if you spicifically use the phrase if i remember noted
wow,not_removed,my bet is that is where we will find our final pillar of creation hot tip
wow,not_removed,maybe there is a treasure chest down there like in the other instances i mean all of them is hidden in some way
wow,not_removed,the hole is opened during the quest in defense of dalaran which is part of the hunter class hall campaign
wow,not_removed,another thread posted previously seems to indicate the hole is present in the room when completing the hunter class hall quest line final quest to defeat hakkar the houndmaster
wow,not_removed,maybe the frost appearance is down there
wow,not_removed,hole in the ground maybe its archaeology
wow,not_removed,upvoted because of nice citation use
wow,not_removed,i actually found this by using death from above about a week after launch my first violet hold hc run never got around to posting the screenshots on reddit but if anyones curious you can see them httpimgurcomaohqfn
wow,not_removed,iirc originally at blizzcon they stated that dalaran moving closer to the broken isles has unearthed new mysteries in the violet hold they showed a clip of the floor opening and us going into some crypts of the hold this obviously never happened and the dungeon is literally just a reskin of the wrath one with nothing new
wow,not_removed,alright i came up with another little quick theory the trapdoor is in front of millificent manastorm she is the only boss that doesnt die millificent can actually be damaged by dot effects after she shrinks herself maybe if every crystal is activated close to her shrinking herself it could kill her and trigger something granted its highly probable that she just goes to but i guess its worth a try also its probably safe to say that this should be tried first in a mythic dungeon since i dont think blizzard would hide a secret on just any difficulty
wow,not_removed,have you had a demon hunter use his spectral sight in there
wow,not_removed,ive leveled an arcane mage there any spec will do its part of the class order hall quests and we go there to slay a demon i dont remember the trapdoor being used for anything but there also wasnt a hole in the floor maybe it has something to do with speedrunning the place now as we know violet hold is timed but there are ways to speed it up if the portal keepers die fast a portal will spawn even if the adds didnt die and you can use the crystal do deal a really considerable damage on the elite demon squads what makes me think of speedrunning violet hold is the fact that all mages have time warp blink frost nova and some other spells i cant remember the first one fits the arcane vibe of the trapdoor and supports the idea of speedrunning vh i dont really know how blink fits but its arcaney as well and frost nova well fuck me right
wow,not_removed,back when gameobjforcemouseover worked you could highlight the trapdoor no interaction game from it unfortunately
wow,not_removed,try using heroic leap on it there was a bug in lights hope chapel where if you heroic leaped onto the floor of the entrance the entrance just opens
wow,not_removed,the second part of my reasoning is that when the developers copy a map it does not include any doodads thats not entirely true to my knowledge if you revisit various places that have been visitied while unlocking certain artifacts or instanced quests in the uninstanced world most of the doodads that are used for each corresponding artifact scenario are still in place on for example the uninstanced broken isles map another example would be the circular area around the elevator in vault of the wardens which is used for the dh lvl starting campaign you can still find several doodads that have been used for the dh scenario if you enter vault of the wardens you can find those by using a macro that lets you identify doodas by hovering your mouse over them it will also identify the questioned doodad in vh as duvioletholdtrapdoor however identifying certain objects in the game as doodads doesnt mean that they are necessarily ever to be interacted with or simply just remnants of other questsscenarios in the game
wow,not_removed,im pretty sure thats where the bug boss spawned on alpha it might just be a leftover
wow,not_removed,did you try archaeology onnear it
wow,not_removed,its apart of the hunter class hall campaign nice theories tho
wow,not_removed,is that just a hunch or was there some kind of evidence on beta to support that it seems like wasted potential considering how the last boss just teleports in
wow,not_removed,what are you using for your hpresource bars and ability bars if you dont mind me asking i want something close to this without having to get to grips with elvuis initially intimidating setup
wow,not_removed,crashed eh
wow,not_removed,thats cool i didnt find your thread or i would have linked it as reference i reiterate my point above though glitching down there does not activate the trigger so we wont find the secret by just glitching down
wow,not_removed,in a future patch khadgar has you use the pillars of creation to deal with the legion but it brings the old gods to the forefront he carves a cave inside vh to sulk in shame while the heroes deal with it for him
wow,not_removed,using the toy rewards you with nothing but pain as in some damage taken and a pretty easy achievemnt
wow,not_removed,can you elaborate did you actually have to open the floor and go down there for something if you were just in violet hold to do something and the trapdoor was open then the same applies as i explained for the hunter campaign above
wow,not_removed,at least should manage to cast it without pathing errors brutal
wow,not_removed,shaman earthquakes that theory will never get tested ive heard ele shamans are banned from the game
wow,not_removed,i wonder if that floor is dcing people since quite a few people in this thread are saying that their game crashed and they logged back inside of it
wow,not_removed,there is that door in votw that can only be accessed with a skaggyldrynk
wow,not_removed,one of my primary hobbies is to datamine and reverseengineering games such as world of warcraft at this specific time i was checking for any signature changes in the file formats used in game objects and happened upon that file name once i had the file name i was able to update the model viewer i used to support the latest file formats and view the model and the animations for it
wow,not_removed,if you read over my comment i go over the fact that i dont believe glitching down there will reveal the secret first we must discover how to open the trapdoor the intended way only then will the secret be shown this is how it works for most secrets blizzard hide as they dont like people getting things by glitching
wow,not_removed,how did you get the floor to open it seems to be missing one of those shots
wow,not_removed,read my main comment
wow,not_removed,yes read my top comment
wow,not_removed,no you dont you fight hakkar and his hounds in the main area with all the farstriders silver covenant and sentinels
wow,not_removed,read my main comment
wow,not_removed,guldan has the final pillar of creation the eye of amanthul
wow,not_removed,the treasure chests are generally not hidden this well considering nobody knows how to open this yet
wow,not_removed,no it isnt
wow,not_removed,read my main comment
wow,not_removed,check my main comment i go over why thats not related
wow,not_removed,you poor death knights never stop hoping do you
wow,not_removed,timo
wow,not_removed,frost hidden appearence was found on my server by someone but they dont know how
wow,not_removed,🤔🤔
wow,not_removed,couldve also done it like this but agreed
wow,not_removed,occams razor they intended on using this trapdoor but decided to cheap out and just reuse the old encounter
wow,not_removed,she stays at its not hard to burst her after the stun
wow,not_removed,if you fight milhouse while having the milhouse toy active you get an unique debuff
wow,not_removed,has anyone tried letting the bombs from this boss encounter explode over that spot
wow,not_removed,thats a good theory that being said part of me wonders how nobody would have already cleared violet hold at an impressive speed already considering the gear available currently
wow,not_removed,theres a hunter class quest to fight a demon in violet hold theres a hole in the floor right in front of manastorms cell edited for words
wow,not_removed,i tried that numerous times it sadly did not work
wow,not_removed,i think perhaps wowedit has an option to copy chunks with or without doodads intact because you are correct that in some places areas do get copied with everything inplace but there are also a lot of places where things become devoid of them all because of copypasting
wow,not_removed,did you read my reason why i dont believe that
wow,not_removed,except anyone who has leveled a hunter will tell you it isnt the holes open but theres nothing down there and hakkarfriends enter via portals like everything else in vh the only reason the hole is open in the campaign is like op said probably because blizzard never bothered adding the trapdoor in the hunters version of the instance
wow,not_removed,this is actually correct when they first announced legionnew dalnew vh they explained that this wouldnt just be a rehash that vhs proximity to the tomb of sargeras would cause it to unlock its catacombs there was supposed to be an entire additional instance down there they scrapped it and rehashed vh in the end
wow,not_removed,someone vaguely said it was quoted somewhere by someone last time i saw this brought up that being said they could be completely wrong and i really hope so because it looks so interesting edit reread your post last time i saw this brought up was the forum post you linked which is what im referencing whoops
wow,not_removed,the resource bars is shadowed unit frames takes a while to set up but worth it my setup there was intended for my dk tank probably not ideal for a dps the ability bars are done with dominos a much simpler addon
wow,not_removed,elvuis setup isnt intimidating at all once you install it and load up your toon theres a set of prompts to help you setup and you can tinker around after that
wow,not_removed,looks like bartender for abilities and shadowed unit frames for the character frames
wow,not_removed,you can copy someone elses elvui profile
wow,not_removed,yeah something about the going on the fritz havent resolve it
wow,not_removed,i like this theory
wow,not_removed,i too leveled a rogue and all i remember doing in there was talking to a demon prisoner at the top in the back then im pretty sure you fight him and its over nothing to do with that part of the room and it might be a third instance of the violet hold map like the hunter campaign didnt finish the rogue campaign so i cant say if you go back later but i dont think you do so it most likely isnt used for rogues either
wow,not_removed,this is something i would like to know about
wow,not_removed,i have to agree the same way the warriors hidden artifact magically showed up today way easier than what was on the legion betas means they probably fucked up or something and cut it man sucks legions turning out to be a sad expac for me at least
wow,not_removed,if you ignore the animation its completely possible the trap door is there just to cover up this part of the instance because it isnt needed outside of the hunter scenario this cave area is part of vhs wmo so instead of just making a seperate wmo without this area they just use the trapdoor to cover it up
wow,not_removed,have you tried archaeology on the trap door 🤔🤔
wow,not_removed,likely the bug i have the bloodfrost one in alternate colors but not the default
wow,not_removed,makes sense hence occams razor but i do hope they do something about it
wow,not_removed,mfw blizzard leave that shit in
wow,not_removed,lmao
wow,not_removed,and one does not simply kill a manastorm
wow,not_removed,ahh thats pretty sad but i guess i did try
wow,not_removed,yeah shrinks you and reduces your stats by something stupid like turns out im dumb thought i read the tooltip properly found that out after id swapped milhouses appearance onto my whole party that was probably the quickest wipe normal violet hold will claim
wow,not_removed,ya its for the mythic dungeon achievement
wow,not_removed,maybe its speed plus something else based on the fact that heavily geared people couldnt care about less about violet hold it doesnt have a mythic keystone maybe so few people do it and they dont do it fast enough
wow,not_removed,because literally everyone hates that dungeon since its introduction in wotlk thank god its not in the keystone list nice post though man loved your formating as well
wow,not_removed,there has been so many people saying that please read the whole op post
wow,not_removed,i started legion maiming a mm hunter and one of if not the last missions during the hunter campaign you do enter violet hold by yourself and that trap door is there its there to help you kill the boss that youre there for nothing else
wow,not_removed,if this is the case i will be fairly disappointed i checked the game files for any sign of work on an additional instance but there are no remnants no maps no extra objects if this is the case it would mean adding this hole into the ground would be about as far as they got in the development before scrapping it which seems strange
wow,not_removed,do you have a source on that
wow,not_removed,but they could still put something in there after scrapping that idea
wow,not_removed,having this as some kind of end boss doesnt really make sense in my mind why would the end boss be coming out of a secret nonprison compartment of the prison like that i also feel that considering this is an extra room and someone has taken the time to create an animated tile for the seal and theyve added projection layers and the likes that they wouldnt discard it for the use of a boss simply teleporting in even if it was planned to be used in the dungeon i feel like the fact that it remained and is clearly not an unfinished addition to the dungeon that it would have been reused for a secret considering the nature of it
wow,not_removed,thanks ill look into those personally i think the focus one would be pretty useful for my mm hunter to help make rotation decisions in advance
wow,not_removed,overclocking even a mild overclock will cause crashes with wow for some strange reason
wow,not_removed,if its an evga its because the heatspreader doesnt touch the vram and its overheating contact evga
wow,not_removed,and demon hunters do the same as well interrogate one prisoner thats the fourth instance
wow,not_removed,its for an alchemy quest theres a bonus boss in there if someone is on the quest
wow,not_removed,i write a lot of the software and scripts myself so i can rely on myself to update them all the information you need to do so can be found on sites like wowdevwiki
wow,not_removed,its not used in the hunter scenario though its just open the same goes for the rogue scenario
wow,not_removed,have you tried corpse exploding the trap door🤔🤔
wow,not_removed,but occams razor is just a razor that belongs to occam
wow,not_removed,really i tought you only get some face damage i always do it as a healer and have no problem with stat losing
wow,not_removed,do you get something for completing him with entire party as milhouse
wow,not_removed,doesnt reduce stats just does a ton of damage
wow,not_removed,i thought the same thing but ended up realizing that the worlds top guilds probably murdered vh pretty hard when they had to run it for kara attunement id be willing to bet theyve got some pretty insane clear speeds
wow,not_removed,as a tank i love violet hold dont have every goddamn dps yelling oh my god pull faster at me every second its the dungeon that pulls for me its wonderful
wow,not_removed,you saying thank god tells me that you dont play agilitystr dps
wow,not_removed,why would you hate it its one of the fastest dungeons to clear
wow,not_removed,what happened to the hunter you maimed is she ok what a terrible thing to do im sorry i had to
wow,not_removed,eh its not the first time theyve bitten off more than they could chew we lost an entire raid at least dungeon in cata despite the instance portals actually being there
wow,not_removed,blizzard has scrapped entire games that were almost totally complete theres a copy of warcraft adventures on the internet that is like the full game missing only cinematics
wow,not_removed,maybe they will add more bosses at a future date would be disappointed as well if this were not the case
wow,not_removed,its possible that saelorn or betrug neither of which start out in prison cells would have bust into the prison from below instead of jumping out from the upper levels or malgath could have broke in from below when starting the dungeon before beginning to summon the other demons
wow,not_removed,the fact that blizzard has said we still havent found many secrets in this expansion helps your theory as well
wow,not_removed,yeah it does run with a very mild overclock ill try setting it back to default cheers
wow,not_removed,gigabyte
wow,not_removed,fire mages too
wow,not_removed,reread what i said i didnt say it was used in the scenario
wow,not_removed,have you tried hotfixing the trap door🤔🤔
wow,not_removed,🤔 hmm
wow,not_removed,the opening animation checks out
wow,not_removed,no clue never managed it
wow,not_removed,am was semi afk during violet hold fuck this dungeon
wow,not_removed,its literally the same instance from years ago you have to wait endlessly for adds to spawn and then for bosses you move like feet the entire run and fall asleep halfway through
wow,not_removed,could you elaborate on what we lost i find all this stuff about missing content fascinating
wow,not_removed,i could definitely see this being mocked up and somebody going wait why are they breaking into the prison just make them teleport like the others
wow,not_removed,ouch this one hurts
wow,not_removed,this one this one hit me hard
wow,not_removed,its not a fun door otherwise it was going to be hotfixed right away
wow,not_removed,have you tried rerolling to ret 🤔🤔
wow,not_removed,its only a hotfix if its documented
wow,not_removed,you get an achieve by doing it at least just yourself as milhouse
wow,not_removed,well of eternity was allegedly initially supposed to be a raid but ended up just being a the abyssal maw raid was scrapped hence the kind of broken storyline w neptulon there was a fight against deathwing in his human form in the twilight highlands in the beta that never made it to live the grim batol raid that never came into being there was also tons of cut questlines that would have explained a lot like the one that had you outing archbishop benedictus as a member of the twilight cult which would explain why you fight him i dont mind cut content i get it sometimes your eyes are bigger than your stomach but the amount of cut storylines bugged me same thing happened a lot in wod see yrels dark secret
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,you think that stuff is interesting look up the nerubian raid from wotlk there was supposed to be an entire zone that led up to a raid under northrend it was cut and some assets were reused for deepholme
wow,not_removed,ret pally is best pally
wow,not_removed,as long as person in the group made her angry as milhouse
wow,not_removed,what a stupid thing to say
wow,not_removed,why not salty
wow,not_removed,its funny because they made dw have a distinct human model because of this preplanned human form fight cata and wod cut so much content
wow,not_removed,whats yrels dark secret
wow,not_removed,well of eternity was allegedly initially supposed to be a raid but ended up just being a its quite cool as it is but a war of the ancients raid could have been amazing
wow,not_removed,there was a raid portal in zuldrak and an unused boss chamber in ahnkahet
wow,not_removed,theres loads more art assets from cancelled content floating around on the internet heres some off the top of my head art for an emerald dream zone or raid were in the game at launch but obviously never used azjolnerub zone and raid famously was supposed to be in wrath but never happened there was also supposed to be a war of the ancients raid in cata that was repurposed into a unsurprisingly there was an including an entire zone farahlon as well as faction capital cities bladespire and karabor
wow,not_removed,triggered
wow,not_removed,salty cause ualexstraszaismywaifu probably stole his waifu
wow,not_removed,yeah from what i heard about wod we were supposed to have one more raid either before or after brf that was going to be a shattrath raid but instead the city is just kinda there with no resolution as far as storyline
wow,not_removed,its not like that is the first time they cut content though what about the troll raid in zuldrak that never came to be for example
wow,not_removed,cata was worth it just for flying in the old world i think people forget just how much it sucked to be stuck on the ground in the capital cities firelands and dragon soul were pretty good raids too
wow,not_removed,and now its just a costume feelsbadman
wow,not_removed,for me those two were easily the least enjoyable of all the expansions i wonder if there was anything different going on on blizzards end during them
wow,not_removed,there is none httpusbattlenetwowengamelorecharactersyrel but never brought up in lore ever again iirc in before daughter of kiljaeden archimonde or even both you never know
wow,not_removed,she has a female draenei clothing line
wow,not_removed,it was heavily implied for awhile in beta that she was raped by orcs
wow,not_removed,shes a fucking liar
wow,not_removed,if you havent done the alliance smv quest chains its basically said over and over that yrel has a dark secret that only velen knows sadly the quest chain was cut perhaps it was tied to the temple of karabor chain that was gutted there has been guesses that her secret is that shes archimondes daughter but theres no real evidence for that or any other theory
wow,not_removed,id also like an explanation
wow,not_removed,plus we lost the whole preoutland netherstorm forgot the name area plus they had something cool planned for the main cities which they scrapped and gave us the shitty ashran crap as the expansions main city
wow,not_removed,dragon soul were pretty good raids too bleh only bosses for the content lull patch was really annoying i only raided casually back then so wed typically get through the dungeon on normal and like bosses on heroic what we call heroic and mythic now before the next thing dropped but ds was so short we actually killed h madness several times before mop also spine fuck spine
wow,not_removed,yea but new orgrimmar is so ugly i never got back to old world unless forced
wow,not_removed,it also appears in the joke questline the day deathwing came in badlands
wow,not_removed,ive always thought she was going to end up being the tyrant velhari fight before they scrapped her having a dark secret
wow,not_removed,so shes a regular hero of the alliance
wow,not_removed,so shes trusty patches
wow,not_removed,oh how so
wow,not_removed,it was heavily implied for awhile in beta that she was raped by orcs
wow,not_removed,preoutland netherstorm farahlon
wow,not_removed,yeah i remember the uproar over the cities which was pretty well justified considering what they gave us in return id say it was the biggest batch of missed opportunities
wow,not_removed,all shaman specs are now viable there is really small difference between enha and ele just pick what is appealing to you more the dps and utility is the same for both specs just a note though ele shares the same gearing needs with resto so you can gear both specs easily
wow,not_removed,for pvp ele is good in and bgs arenas are still a problem for us
wow,not_removed,thanks for all the infos guys exactly what i needed
wow,not_removed,ok thank you very much always wanted to play the good old ele again what they did with it seems a lot a fun already killing it in bg but rsham seems way to hard in arenas haha
wow,not_removed,ele is so much fun builds that are very close lightning rod is more cleaveish icefury is tricky but fun and ascendance is very cool to look at look for stormearthlava on google it has everything you need to know about ele
wow,not_removed,nice i had trouble finding good guides and infos i think i already prefer icefury never liked the ascendance form haha thank you guys for the fast answers i knew i could find some nice shamans around here just owned fucking dh at the same time in bg already loving it haha
wow,not_removed,httpwwwstormearthandlavacom
wow,not_removed,guess so ive been waiting an hour already still cant log back in
wow,not_removed,no you have to wait for the ddos attacks to stop
wow,not_removed,you character is in an area affected by the ddos so if your order hall is offline and your character is in there you cant log in edit really youre gonna downvote me for explaining why certain characters cant be logged into
wow,not_removed,yes people do it and theres no downside aside from having to wait for your token to sell on the ah
wow,not_removed,isnt this exactly the point and purpose of wow tokens i was under the impression that literally everytime you buy a wow token off the ah that is a wow token which someone else purchased with real money and put up on the ah to make some ingame gold so that said there are a lot of people who regularly buy wow tokens with real money to sell for gold and yea other than the question of whether gold is really worth euro there is no downside
wow,not_removed,yes fairly often
wow,not_removed,i did it on eu servers and would get each token but now when i am reactivating my usa account its like per token seems pretty low also no downside and super smooth and legit just takes a few hours sometimes for the token to sell
wow,not_removed,ive bought two i honestly dont like the ecommerce aspect of warcraft i did in the past but its just too much time nowadays my ingame expenses arent crazy so at the beginning of legion and whenever they originally came out i bought one to fund myself so i would have more time to play
wow,not_removed,one thing to note the gold you get for selling tokens is the amount the ah tells you when you put the token there so lets say you put the token on ah when it costs but when the token is sold the price on ah is you will still only get for it not to maximize how much you get from the token go to wowtokeninfo and check there at what points in the day the token usually cost the most and sell it at that time the prize seems very stabel now but it is still a difference of nearly between a good and a bad sell on eu
wow,not_removed,i dont bother with cash for gold stuff its ridiculously easy to farm gold in the game when i came back about months ago after years break i was dead broke as i had given away all the gold in the months since ive farmed enough to buy a very useful yak mount and that overpriced allied bike why isnt horde version available for gold i missed logging in for free version plus a few other vendor mounts and catching up on recipes and mats for player made pets and mounts thats about gold total spent in the last months and right now i am sitting on gold so about gold in month of casual gaming turbocharged flying machine is a bitch to farm for and sells for a shitload on ah khorium is a rare ore in bc and with very few players farming old zones khorium rarely shows up cheap on ah wotlk hig mount also sells well not many people wants to farm assload of titanium ore ores total to make one in the long run when i farm for either of the mount i end up with profit of about per hour locally wage is still like so i would have to work about hours after tax to get one token for gold so in game option seemed better to me ymmv server economics are inconsistent ps whats the gold cap might need to mail excess gold to an alt
wow,not_removed,i sold one on or around christmas day because they doubled in price
wow,not_removed,i havent done it personally but my buddy done is all the time because he doesnt have the same amount of time as me to grind out gold for raiding and stuff
wow,not_removed,i did before i realized how easy gold was to make
wow,not_removed,sold like the last months if wod just cause i wanted some damm mounts from the ah p that i never use xd
wow,not_removed,if youre willing to wait a little longer for your gold there are better ways to get it by spending real money without breaking rules option warcraftpetscom its a website where people can trade pets but also often tcgblizzcon codes which are always in high demand the downside here is that you have to buy the code then find someone who wants it that part isnt too hard and also finding a trustworthy person to buy off you since someone has to go first there are plenty of reputable people on this website and if youre willing to wait then id recommend this route option wowtcglootcom or wootlootscom sell digital tcg codes and some of the mounts and pets are tradeable and will give you a better dollar to gold ratio than tokens this one requires less waiting and less risk than the first option youre waiting for your items to sell in trade or on the auction house if you dont want to wait then buy tokens not really sure why the downvotes neither of the two options break rules and give more bang for your buck though perhaps not suited for a new player to the game
wow,not_removed,if you want value for money youre honestly better of just going through one of the legitimate gold farming sites
wow,not_removed,see its easy enough to say that gold is easy to come by but ive been playing wow for a total of days and i have no idea what any of what you said actually is but thank you for the links i shall save them for down the road
wow,not_removed,i mean it all depends on the person i have a limited amount of time to play the game given my work schedule and i want to spend as much of that time as possible doing exactly the content i want to be doing tokens let me do that
wow,not_removed,id recommend saving the bloods for order resources on your alts as itll be required to purchase ak
wow,not_removed,easy say its easy farm but you dont know how much time op has to play you dont want to end up spending all your time on tsm either for some people who are working euros isnt that much
wow,not_removed,easy say its easy farm but you dont know how much time op has to play you dont want to end up spending all your time on tsm either for some people who are working euros isnt that much
wow,not_removed,how do i set up bloodmoney for eu i dont know much about js but i cant figure out how to compile it any ideas
wow,not_removed,a waste of hard earned cash is only relative to the monetary value of your free time if your salary is anywhere above minimum wage and making gold requires active goldmaking from you its pretty efficient i think if you need that gold with any sense of urgency otherwise passive gold making is pretty high
wow,not_removed,the blood money website is that us only edit ignore me found a link to eu in comments below
wow,not_removed,note that the bloodmoney tool you posted only has us realms so for op it is useless since they are eu
wow,not_removed,ah thats actually pretty cool i can happily part with euros then since is going to boost me up so much because im fairly new how long do they usually take to sell
wow,not_removed,sorry i didnt actually realize until i went and bought one that you cant actually redeem it for game time you have to sell it mybad
wow,not_removed,in a nutshell us people work a lot and have a lot more money so they have less gold so it sells for less eu people have a lot more free time meaning they have more gold and doesnt get paid as much in many countries so its more expensive
wow,not_removed,yeah that kinda annoys me too ive got the alliance chopper for gold which you can easily buy and farm but i wasnt allowed to play world of warcraft in the time of the chopper due to my young age and school so i missed out on the horde chopper which is really bad since i main horde
wow,not_removed,the horde choppa is not available due to some harebrained copyright or something issue not blizz fault but very regrettable im lucky enough to have it but now i play alli because of my darn friends
wow,not_removed,wow i didnt even know you could buy mounts from the ah
wow,not_removed,have you used these sites before any body has feedback from option also i tried to go to wootlootscom and it redirected me to blizzard website
wow,not_removed,there is literally no such thing as legitimate gold farming
wow,not_removed,if you want to you can pm me and ill send you my battletag im in the hospital recovering from surgery for another two ish days and cant move around i wouldnt mind answering all your questions
wow,not_removed,the best way to make money early on is not to spend it if youre new to the game then good things to spend money on are armor repairs skill trainers and ridingflying skills maybe heirlooms bad things to spend money on are things in the auction house this changes if you are raiding not lfr or doing mythic plus dungeons then you want to buy raid consumables like potions and flasks
wow,not_removed,this if i make at least an hour at a real job and it would take over an hour to make gold that i want to use for something that makes the game more enjoyable then it just makes sense ive bought in the past year when i came up short on gold to train some new professions or buy mounts
wow,not_removed,not everyone cares about alts
wow,not_removed,its written in rust install it first then download the project from github and extract it launch command line in extracted directory and there type cargo build it can take a while since it will download dependencies etc but should compile without a problem
wow,not_removed,httpsrodentiobloodmoneyeu
wow,not_removed,ingame they say they take less than hours to sell i have only ever sold one i think it only took like hours
wow,not_removed,how long do they usually take to sell i bought one so i had a bit of initial capital to start playing the auctionhouse took hours to sell in the beginning of november
wow,not_removed,you can if you just have it in your inventory or bank when your gametime runs out the token will becan be redeemed for gametime
wow,not_removed,living in eu feelsbadman wish i was playing in na id have so many token already but instead i need to farm my ass off every month to make enough for a new token on eu
wow,not_removed,its because the population difference between the servers
wow,not_removed,how does that make sense for korea china taiwan when tokens run and people have even less free time if theyre working
wow,not_removed,odd both urls work for me yes i have used all of the websites i listed in the past both of the tcg websites gave me the codes id bought without any issue and ive never had any problems on warcraftpets though as with any website of that nature beware of who youre trading with and if youre going first make sure the person youre trading with is reputable and that they are who they say they are ive had nothing but good experiences there and spent multiple millions of gold over there as far as option goes its something ive done in the past but doing research on what youre buying to sell is of course wise
wow,not_removed,i mean the sites with a good general rapport of which there are definitely a few
wow,not_removed,the real mvp right here wish you a speedy recovery and a great new year
wow,not_removed,ah not bad i can list it now and hopefully have it done when i get up thanks
wow,not_removed,no you cant the token you buy from the store and the one from ah are two different things you cannot buy a token with real money and then redeem it for game time
wow,not_removed,no joke gold farming is a job over there they will hardgrind gold and loots to sell and its plagued by bots
wow,not_removed,jesus i think i know something about wow and then realize its just a drop in the ocean haha
wow,not_removed,wish u good loot and stable connect
wow,not_removed,you have further down the rabbit hole to go alice
wow,not_removed,so info region why are you stuck on it too much damage are you trying to solo the goal is so have all three light rays target you and you move to the white circle before the spectrum begins the white circles briefly flash then you move to their location then one of the unique fog beasts will appear then you pan around the room and kill the three crimson beasts rinse and repeat more times done the main problem is damage and the healing debuff which makes it near impossible to solo the targeted light rays only hit ranged characters so having a tank to soak the healing debuff is enough to push through the damage without worrying about the other player doing the white circle thing and you dont have to kill the boss to get the achievement so i dont know why it would take months
wow,not_removed,on us tanaris alliance trying to solo it but i can never seem to see the white circle flash so i just run around the whole thing mindlessly until i find it i can get of the every time but i die on the spectrum every time cause i dont see the white flash
wow,not_removed,okay try turning your graphic settings up some this turned the white flashes into incredibly visible white splotches however the triple beam phase is really graphically intensive so beware
wow,not_removed,i run with everything near max i still just cant seem to see them also the life drain stun makes it very difficult to stay alive
wow,not_removed,he doesnt stun you if you follow the mechanics right never run through the purple eye beam and say on the side with the purple snakelike swirls on the ground during that phase and the heal debuff should reset after that but yeah that is why this achievement is so hard to solo i would help you in game if i could i recommend making a custom group finder or talking to the people that wait in front of the raid entrance for the world boss someone will help hopefully just need a tank or a healer i guess a monk might be able to solo with the statue in melee or maybe a hunter dont know how hunters heal themselves i know a rogue with the will of valeera legendary and the feint talent can solo it also make sure you are doing it on normal difficulty man heroic is legitimately impossible
wow,not_removed,ahh okay thanks for all the info im trying man normal on a ret pally so may be why its so difficult i just bubble the heal debuff and heal but its still super difficult ill try asking around outside never thought to do that
wow,not_removed,on a side note did you solo the soft hands achievement
wow,not_removed,i did not i got all others back in progression but for whatever reason we didnt do this one or i missed it
wow,not_removed,thats cool good luck with this one
wow,not_removed,level professions raise some reps or fuck around you could go to tanaan jungle if you have the boatyard but if you dont then stay away the cost of building the boat yard isnt worth it for weeks then on the when invasions happen focus on those
wow,not_removed,erp in the goldshire inn
wow,not_removed,i was disconnected and cant get back in while a mate was also disconnected at the same time but immediately got back in
wow,not_removed,it is mostly instance stuff like new dal and dungeons etc overworld is still working for me on dathremar
wow,not_removed,gotta love those scriptkiddies how dare anyone have fun
wow,not_removed,i cant log on my mage on dathremar and its in suramar i can log on all my alts fine and theyre all in stormwind want my mage pls
wow,not_removed,do not do this again
wow,not_removed,i apologize for this i need to not voice my angry opinion
wow,not_removed,lol
wow,not_removed,i like to think so d
wow,not_removed,cant read the text on mobile 😕 edit figured it out had to open image in imgur app thats hilarious
wow,not_removed,i fell for this trick once once
wow,not_removed,i must be dumbi dont get why this is funny
wow,not_removed,except the way to the herbalist
wow,not_removed,can someone help me i got lost trying to find the herbalist
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,this is the toy i got from killing a rare
wow,not_removed,thanks for this this was exactly what i was looking for it seems since the prepatch all you need to do is eat the fish raw after you fish it
wow,not_removed,if you read my post you would see that i listed that item specificly as not what i was looking for is what i was looking for
wow,not_removed,well then next time spend minutes looking up your own shit you dumb fuck
wow,not_removed,i looked for about hours and couldnt find what the buff was tied to chill
wow,not_removed,ive always heard that wow was much more casual friendly at launch compared to other mmos having pve servers and not being punished harshly for dying wasnt in every other game for example
wow,not_removed,this caused a lot of rage back then i think it was the first time ive heard the term carebear years later i still appreciate blizzard giving zero fucks about what people think an mmo would not survive without casuals look what happened to wildstar or any other mmo that thinks being hard is an edge everyone would prefer
wow,not_removed,well the thing youre omitting perhaps not on purpose though is that mmos back then would literally punish you horribly for dying in uo youd just simply lose all of the items you had on you unless you were revived in time can you imagine being level in vanilla getting ganked and then not having anything in wow you just run back incur a durability hit on your armor pay for its repair and move on in fact wow was considered the kiddie mmo within a lot of circles when compared to games like everquest or ultima online it came down to simplicity and overall design winning the game for blizzard in the end
wow,not_removed,wow started off as more of a time reward thing than anything else everything took time to do but wasnt exactly challenging your skill limits or harshly punishing failure older mmos felt like they secretly hated you and tried their best to cripple your character saving someone from death basically made you their friend on that action alone
wow,not_removed,anyone who played eq knows wow was a casual mmo
wow,not_removed,you have to remember that casual now isnt the same as casual then the big mmos at the time of wows release were everquest star wars galaxies and matrix online compared to those vanilla wow was much more casual especially swg which was my first mmorpg that game just threw you straight in the deep end in fact i remember some players in swg mocking wow for being so casual and kiddy at the time of its release
wow,not_removed,yeah but the game doesnt appeal to me and therefore it is terribad
wow,not_removed,people who claim that wow was made for a hardcore audience werent playing when it was new the game was constantly ridiculed as being for casuals by players of all the other big mmos the only death penalty being a loss of a tiny bit of money pfft casuals
wow,not_removed,its always been that way here is part of the metzen qa from a eu trade show we are shooting for a wider breadth of world where there will be number of different kingdoms and zonessub zones to adventure in we are trying to focus on core quest systems for hard core players so that if you are the kind of gamer with the massively multi player element that spends hours a week youll be able to join guilds and go on massive extended quests that could take weeks to play for the casual gamer as well you will be able to join the game in your lunch hour or whenever you can and still have a meaningful play experience you will have any number of tasks or quests which do not involve that much time there will always be an element of completion – you will feel that there are things you can accomplish in a short time the world will be dynamic constantly changing so it is not aimed at the specialised user then no we are aiming it at as many people as we can there is a problem that online games are sometimes aimed at the specialist on line gamer and technically they are the core market however we wanted to find a way where we can bring as many people into the warcraft environment as possible which means trying to blend the best of both worlds this in turn means a real hard core game for the higher end gamers but with ease of use and ease of interface which has drawn people to games like diabalo which is simplistic but it is tricky to achieve this
wow,not_removed,eq players used to mock wow as the mmo for babies
wow,not_removed,this is compared to the other mmos at the time though
wow,not_removed,i doubt many people will remember this but back in the heady days of when wow was launching in europe i was playing at a high level in anarchy online at the time this game was derived by us hard core for its casual nature giant quest markers above their heads what are these people stupid wow has always been a casual friendly game certainly compared to early mmos it is sad to me that it has forgotten its roots
wow,not_removed,if i compare wow with ragnarok back in if ou die in ragnarok you will be so pissed you lose a lot of xp well in wow just repair the gear wich was also a big deal
wow,not_removed,its the only mmo that respects your time without asking for money in exchange for such respect until recently ie char boost most mmos even today dont let you be competitive unless you it or fork over tons of cash
wow,not_removed,as someone coming from tibia i was amazed that you didnt lose exp or equipment when you die apart from loss of durability on items and running to corpse there was well is no punishment for dying in tibia you cant go full retard to a place you dont know unprepared dying cost exp weaponmagic skill exp they higher the skill the higher damage you deal a backpack so all your equipment and every piece of you equipped gear had a or to drop so back in you could lose hours of grinding also quests you had to talk to npcs in order to trigger quests
wow,not_removed,nobody has ever claimed wow to be hardcore in fact quite the opposite i briefly played everquest i spent hours days even gathering materials to craft myself some armour eventually i had everything went to craft it and it failed not only did it fail but i lost all the mats yeah kind of lost interest after that
wow,not_removed,back in the day wow was def considered more casual then other mmos just the simple fact that you didnt lose your xp or any other serious penalty when you died made it less hardcore
wow,not_removed,to be fair this was during an era where the average mmo consisted of mostly just grinding mobs to no particular end when questing was usually not an effective way to level and when levelling was considered the bulk of the game raiding wasnt really a primary selling point for mmos during this time period
wow,not_removed,wow now seems casual compared to bc or vanilla but bc and vanilla were still relatively casual back then i didnt play a ton nor was i particularly good in bcwas also like at launch and i still slowly progressed through some raid content
wow,not_removed,casual in was not thay casual though
wow,not_removed,no one claims it was made for only hardcore players but it doesnt mean that casuals should have access to the same content as hardcore players there needs to be a gap
wow,not_removed,yes because molten core was very casual
wow,not_removed,typical marketing bla bla flexible reward systems they meant rng
wow,not_removed,i think its also noteworthy what casual in was compared to casual in up to present day life is good now or not depending on your pov
wow,not_removed,compared to anarchy online vanilla wow felt like a game for little children
wow,not_removed,i was going to say who the hell ever claimed wow was for hardcore players the fact that you can solo all the way to level cap from day one following yellow and had no real penalty for doing anything stupid kind of indicated the casual theme also lets not forget that it through full sets of gear at you every zone and hell the first expansion literally made all original raiding pointless because mid expansion greens from trash where superior
wow,not_removed,it was still a grind my game and you had to be hardcore to experience of end game content technically any game can be played casually wow wasnt much more if at all casual friendly than most other rpgs during its time its certainly gotten a lot better so i do buy that the intent was there it just took them a while to streamline every thing wraith was really the first time that the game actually felt casual friendly again obviously that doesnt mean there werent casual players in classicbc
wow,not_removed,wildstar raiding was fucking great though i loved how locked down everything was and being one of the few able to do the and having the devs on our teamspeakstreams asking us what we would change and stuff i hadnt enjoyed raiding that much since naxxsunwell youre right that it couldnt survive because so few people were able to do it so they unsubscribed but it was super fun while it lasted we ended up just not being able to recruit because the only people we could recruit were from other world guilds then everyone quit
wow,not_removed,i still appreciate blizzard giving zero fucks about what people think that why we wont have any vanilla servers so i hop you dont want them back i do not want them myself
wow,not_removed,wow started off as more of a time reward money thing friend fixed that for all the goblins
wow,not_removed,swg i remember fondly but i also remember that it was totally devoid of any balance to the various combat roles and remained that way for as long as i played it
wow,not_removed,as they rounded out their hour sitting in a single spot killing the same mob over and over in the hopes of the named spawning instead of the placeholder so they could loot a quest item xd
wow,not_removed,it is sad to me that it has forgotten its roots what makes you say that ive been playing casually for years and i think there are more and more casualfriendly perks with each expansionpatch
wow,not_removed,anarchy online d i remember running around asking for wrangler to be able to put on my armor stupid system they had but fun on my first min ingame some friendly player giftet me a flying machine and mil cred
wow,not_removed,what do you mean by same content casuals shouldnt be allowed to do raiding certain quests mythic dungeons
wow,not_removed,compared to eq raids yes
wow,not_removed,mc was very casual ragnaros and executus were the only bosses who had more than one mechanic and only just barely your argument would have weight if you went with or naxx where you had to clear basically every raid before them to be geared enough and where mechanics were actually punishing as it was mc could easily be cleared with competent players mediocre players and ten people who only knew how to push the decursive button and not blow up the raid with living bomb the only reason the anniversary event was at all difficult is that all those bosses who debuff the entire raid every seconds or so are impossible to cleanse in time now that all the cleansing spells have cooldowns
wow,not_removed,i think you mean nexus core
wow,not_removed,what do you mean half the fights in mc had multiple targets aq had bugtrio twin emperors first boss partially and that flying boss
wow,not_removed,lucifron
wow,not_removed,well they were talking about for quests most quests had multiple options of what piece of gear you could chose from you could usually pick from four different pieces of gear now i didnt play eq or ultima online but i would guess that each quest only gave a set reward wows quest system added a more flexible reward system
wow,not_removed,didnt lose exp when you die this was probably the biggest thing for me a little corpse run in wow compared to losing xp and possibly levelling down ffxi or accruing xp debt city of heroes and nerfing your xp gains to for the rest of your characters life even though i had been invested in the ff franchise longer than the warcraft franchise it was an easy choice for me
wow,not_removed,didnt lose exp when you die yeah and items having played ultima online before wow when i died for the first time i thought shit by the time im back all my gear is probably gone took me a few deaths to realize you cant loot other players
wow,not_removed,oh yeah coming from ao i was amazed by the fact that i could simply level to max by soloing and how little time it took doing hecklers for weeksmonths on end tempered me good lol
wow,not_removed,always get pumped when i see an ao reference i remember when wow came out the prevailing wisdom in the ao community was casual kiddy mmo
wow,not_removed,when wow came out you could not level all the way up by following quests you would just run out of quests with levels to go
wow,not_removed,vanilla was casual friendly because death wouldnt make you lose your stuff or lose experience you could solo to the levelcap in the span of months rather than years in the case of some of them without intense knowledge of the game and a lot of connections sure a casual player wouldnt see or naxx but a casual eq uo or ac player wouldnt even reach within levels of the cap
wow,not_removed,the grind in wow was of the grind in other mmos at the time the game was fast paced and streamlined compared to other games available i know a lot of people think back to playing vanilla wow and the grind that went into it but that was seriously nothing compared to the grind in literally every other mmo out there you didnt have to be hardcore to experience most things hardcore is a relative term and for what it meant at the time the time requirements of wow were anything but hardcore
wow,not_removed,gotcha i hope i didnt come off ass aggressive when i said that i totally agree my point was the same as yours wow was never the hardcore experience it was never meant to be just hardcore
wow,not_removed,i mean i feel like they did to an extent in wrath heroic dungeons were complete snoozefests and i was pretty salty about it then when cata launched you had people complaining about how hard heroics were and they ended up being easier come mopwod but blizzard has since discovered the obvious solution making more difficulty levels i think keystones are despite their many flaws perhaps the best thing blizzard has ever added to the game
wow,not_removed,depends which version of the game you mean if you mean the original precu version then yeah the balance was all over the place especially in pvp
wow,not_removed,youre giving me flashbacks
wow,not_removed,sol a is a great place to hang out kill placeholder sol a is a great place to hang out kill placeholder sol a is a great place to hang out nervous laughter kill placeholder twitch
wow,not_removed,bought a new account over the weekend for raf and i need to say that it had such great tips in it that i would have loved when i started adding to the improved questlines from cata and much of the streamlined accountwide features collections especially i think the game is only getting better ive played vanilla wow im glad they changed these parts
wow,not_removed,most of the shrieking about filthy casuals is from raiders who got jealous that people outside their elite club got to see endgame raids the amount of vitriol that poured forth when lfr came out was simply amazing the hardcore raiders were so upset that we worked so hard to get to this point and achieved all this and youre just going to throw loot and cool stuff at all these dirty casuals who cant even grasp mechanics they were also upset at raids in wrath and especially butthurt over the change to making the loot equal ilvl halfway through icc tldr hardcore players have always been salty about any change that made the game more accessible because they thought they were special snowflakes and blizzard developed raids only for them
wow,not_removed,anything heroic raiding and above shouldnt be as easy as it is right now theres nothing heroic about current heroic raiding outside of tovs current set up it has nothing to do with letting them do x or y it has to do with the over simplistic style blizzard has gone with lately and the whole ilvl debacle and the introduction of the tf system has really ruined any sense of gear progression letting casual players have easy access to highendhardcore raid level gear was a mistake i hope they overlook its as simple as reducing the ilvl cap to that of the heroic raid this way we stop seeing raid finder gear
wow,not_removed,oh were talking about eq guess ill just go away then because i thought this was about wow
wow,not_removed,you thought the anniversary mc raid was hard guess we had vastly different groups and the part about mc being casual how many times did you need other players for hours to play the endgame of a game you bought before personally none
wow,not_removed,mechanic is a stretch but yes mc was extremely casual friendly because the dps requirements were very lax there were few if any enrage timers on the early mc bosses and good players could easily carry a raid
wow,not_removed,the very first boss in mc had adds
wow,not_removed,eq it was a set reward system you also didnt get to see the quest reward when you started so if you didnt look online before hand you might get some cloth for your warrior
wow,not_removed,let us not forget the crafting system nothing like blowing through stacks of mats while skilling up and often getting no item back i made it to grandmaster blacksmithingi still have flashbacks it was a breath of fresh air to craft in wow and know that i would get a useable item every time and the quest mobs for the epics certain important quest mobs werent always available to be killed they would have what was called a placeholder mob that would spawn in that spot most times and each respawn had a chance to be the one you needed i spent hours straight camping the mob for the cleric epic and got nothing but placeholders then i nodded off for minutes or so and i awoke to see someone else kill him i nearly cried one thing wow didnt have that i really really wish it did was the dyeing system
wow,not_removed,city of heroes aw man you just made me have a moment of sadness for the passing of that mmo well shit a quick google says that it exits again
wow,not_removed,my mind was blown when the only requirement to equip an item was just being the right level compared to the hours of implant laddering and looking for buffs and stat gear to equip new armour in ao
wow,not_removed,i feel sleep deprived just thinking about circling those damned islands in inf killing mortiigs again
wow,not_removed,thats untrue at worst there was a drought in the low where you had to do multiple zones intended for that level range but you certainly could quest
wow,not_removed,wrath was not easy content i remember doing icc back then most people didnt make it past ulduar it was just the dungeons that were easy
wow,not_removed,i agree mostly however keystones are not what i was expecting i thought it would be strategic like tbc heroics where youd plan a pull but its still just group and aoe down as quick as possible
wow,not_removed,have you tried one of the progression servers they do i played on one last december and actually had a really fucking good time i didnt stay for long after hitting max level but it was a blast going back down memory lane for a few weeks i highly recommend it
wow,not_removed,ok thats fair i just took your previous comment to suggest certain content should only be available to hardcore players but i agree the difficulty should be higher but im not looking too much into it yet as weve only had nightmare was a nice starter raid to an expansion albeit a bit easy at heroic level nighthold hopefully has the difficulty ramped up a bit more trials of valor certainly is harder than nightmare which is good requires more knowledgeunderstanding of the fight the difficulty is just right my only issue was the rewards but they kinda addressed it while it doesnt bother me seeing players who cant play as much receive high ilevel gear introducing a cap on lfr ilevel wouldnt be bad at all like you suggest cap it to no higher than current heroic raid ie lfr nighthold shouldnt give ilevel higher than heroic version
wow,not_removed,uh yeah an excerpt from a promo site for wow in is almost certainly going to indirectly compare itself to eq
wow,not_removed,how many mmos did you play at endgame even in wow mc was very casual anyone could dip their toes in it and full clear it eventually and the anniversary event wasnt hard it just had broken mechanics and i hopped in it once before the lfr crowd figured it out and never again after so basically i had a group of people that never set foot in the raid not worth it for a raid that was extremely boring even in vanilla
wow,not_removed,lmao yeah hes remembering vanilla very differently
wow,not_removed,oh boy so true not to mention going into perk reset mode for weeks to equip your high level symbs everyone had to whip out the calculator when it came to equipping stuff in ao and in wow you just need to reach the level req and right click the item man i sometimes get so nostalgic for this stupid game
wow,not_removed,it is true at launch to get to lvl you had to grind mobs for awhile there were like quests total between eastern and western plaguelands there was basically nothing in silithus there were a few in winterspring but not enough they were somewhat quick about fixing it but it did launch that way
wow,not_removed,he meant wrath dungeons which were a snoozefest outside of oculus and the icc dungeons no cc required just aoe and timely interrupts for healers oculus was only hard because the vehicle mechanics were new and people didnt grok them and the ui was new and most people were rocking some shitty bagbar mod that broke it so youd get to the end of the dungeon and people would either be terrible at using the drake or completely unable to do anything
wow,not_removed,you do exactly that though at least we do at where you have to cc not to die
wow,not_removed,strategic planning such as sheep x sap moon then spend the next minute dpsing down one mob at a time with no real punishment for failure since you could just recc the mobs yup thats definitely a lot more challenging than trying to push your class to the limits in terms of damage mitigationdamagehealing
wow,not_removed,keystones are everything wrong with current wow to me just a mad dps race and trying to burn through a piece of content in as quick a time as possible
wow,not_removed,i have gone back and dabbled in eq again it was definitely fun to do for a little but i found myself missing so many of the quality of life changes definitely a fun thing to do though
wow,not_removed,yeah really i tried to avoid the whole ilvl thing as an argument but really thats what were all focused on as much as im ashamed to admit it its a horrible feeling knowing youre into mythic progression but you see that ilvl mage doing dps in lfr get an piece at least scale the rewards based on performance
wow,not_removed,spending hours a few days a week with other people isnt casual it wasnt casual back then either
wow,not_removed,its cause he ran through mc on his main way after the fact and the bosses didnt spawn anything in the seconds they took to kill
wow,not_removed,i got to before dire maul was added without ever resorting to grinding western plaguelands was a low zone eastern plaguelands had the tirion fordring questine which was long as hell and several other questlines that ended in group content like the battle of darrowshire or a dungeon quest also there was still ungoro and burning steppes they had unusually large level ranges back then with quests going from
wow,not_removed,i remember doing the occulus at the beginning of wrath people couldnt even get the second boss down a lot of the time they didnt understand where to stand at with the lightning even the dungeons in legion are cakewalks though dungeons have been easy for a long time they had to add a completely new mode and then keystones to make them appropriately challenging for geared players
wow,not_removed,i didnt say anything about the challenge i said they were not what i was expecting i personally enjoyed sheep x style of play to each their own
wow,not_removed,its definitely not a mad dps race all the time haha while i agree that keystones are flawed it is by no means everything wrong with current wow for example the overflowing affix gives me a healer a pretty darn good challenge on managing my heals skittish works for tanks and dps in that they will have to be careful about managing their threat levels with mobs sure insane dps can solve all these problems but the idea is that you get to challenge yourself when you dont have the dps to easily shit on everything
wow,not_removed,keystones are flawed indeed why punish the rest of the group especially the key holder when someone leaves for whatever reason i hate how a depleted key needs to get run again without offering loot at the end no one wants to run a depleted key because its not beneficial to anyone and needs to be run twice to get loot
wow,not_removed,keystones are flawed of course starting with the cancer affixes but to think its just a mad dps race ill just say i completely disagree
wow,not_removed,most of which was not available immediately on launch
wow,not_removed,and the easiest cure to overflowing is bringing a brewmaster they are not as bad as people think but theyre still rare and tricky to play probably rare because they are tricky to get full effectiveness out of
wow,not_removed,at higher keystone level it completely is the only other strategy is finding ways to avoid trash that takes longer to kill
wow,not_removed,all of it was the content blizzard added early in the game to address the drought was mainly maraudon and searing gorge content
wow,not_removed,a well played brewmaster is as good as they are rare
wow,not_removed,easiest cure ive found is playing a resto druid d
wow,not_removed,every piece of content or at least pve content boils down to a dps race but if you disregard the other mechanics no matter how much theoretical or simmed dps you have it wont matter when youre dead thats just the way i see it
wow,not_removed,if you never ran out of quests and never had to do any grinding on the way to at launch you had a very different experience that literally everyone else
wow,not_removed,it depends on the fight sometimes with random mechanics the dpsr may just be unlucky and will get chosen each time to take some damage this ma also result in poor dps for that fight since they are dodgingavoiding much more than normal however generally speaking threat isnt that much of an issue for tanks anymore at least not as much as it was before cata besides if a boss hits a dps instead of a tank youll know you wont need the damage meter to tell you
wow,not_removed,most likely a melee standing in cleave dps ignoring tactics
wow,not_removed,i play forst dk and i try to maintain my dps as high i can meanwhile i am staying lowest on healing damage taken to give the healer the least work on me i have been playing melee dps pretty much from the first day and been raiding always and i like to believe when guilds especially my current one takes in count who goes on mythic progressing or so these two statistics mentioned above are also taken in count i saw loads of failed mythic in the beginning because one or two of our dps were not really cared enough to dodge the smallest shit and have wiped us sometimes it costs my dps a bit but from what i saw till now i was always the first or second on dps meters mythic and usually in the top at raids
wow,not_removed,depends on the type of damage taken but unless its skittish every damage taken by dpshealer is either a normal mechanic or a fail cant blame the tank for people standing in fire eating breaths and whatnot
wow,not_removed,yeah you definitely need to look at the damage types and the log replay if its melee damage the tank didnt have aggro if its cleave it depends on the positioningdid the tank swing the boss around or did the dps go stand in front puddles could go either way did the tank have the boss in a position surrounded by puddles but are most likely a dps error you cant really look at the overall damage taken graph and say the tanks suck youre going to have to look at each target and ability in detail
wow,not_removed,any melee rogue got viable specs
wow,not_removed,im having a good time blasting peoples buttholes as an enhancement shaman although there are some that can blast mine right back
wow,not_removed,seeing a lot of rogues havoc dh is iffy you need to burst someone before you get ccd because theyre super weak defensively recently nerfed arms warrior is doing well but itll be rough as blizzard is eyeing them for nerfs also recently nerfed it also seems all shaman specs are doing decently which would be a great choice as it would give you a lot of fill in for your group
wow,not_removed,really hard question to answer as it depends on what pvp you plan to play and how well you can play the class for example sub rogue is one of the best dueling classes but if you cannot manage energycds and combo points you wont be any good at it i find at alot of the time the op classes are only op when they are in the hands of players at known them inside out anyway to answer your question you need state what pvp you are siming to focus on one class may be op in but suck in and rbgs etc choose one and let me know and ill try to help
wow,not_removed,fire mage is garbage in pvp just tested it today you use combustion then you get stunlockedsilencedinterrupted and once it runs out youre fucking useless you dont have any sustain or mobility if you want a broken class for pvp go for demon hunter they are broken as shit right now
wow,not_removed,dh is not broken they were just nerfed and theyre basically squishballs when they go meta just cc and focus or snare and kite them prenerf they may have hit harder but it was the same tactic honestly i dont think theres any real broken pvp specs at the moment just some that thrive in certain environments dh does not thrive in arena as it requires a team to basically save them shaman thrives very well in arena especially resto nearly every rogue spec is doing great in arena and they actually crap on dh and most other classes as well
wow,not_removed,rshammy seem to be the best healers atm but imo they are all good
wow,not_removed,yea having the same problem on aussie servers edit now the world server is down
wow,not_removed,i had that problem left it for mins then it loaded in hopefully you can get back it soon
wow,not_removed,just got dropped from broken shores scenario you have been disconnected much sadness
wow,not_removed,same thing is occuring to me cant get into my priest was in azsura load then dc into error
wow,not_removed,its the ddos nothing can be done to help you might manage to get on at some point if you do get in do not log out and avoid loading screens
wow,not_removed,theres an active ddos event check blizzardcs on twitter nothing will work properly until the hack stops
wow,not_removed,can you post back when you can get on thanks champ
wow,not_removed,can you post back when you can get in
wow,not_removed,a dos is not a hack and considering that europe got the same last night without a dos id say its not related to that
wow,not_removed,please read what i said i can log into any other character
wow,not_removed,got back on just minutes later after the edit
wow,not_removed,about minutes after the post was made didnt see this till now sorry
wow,not_removed,youre absolutely correct im just using common language that the media uses to label this attack
wow,not_removed,certain things are affected by the ddos certain zones are offline such as my mages order hall and teleportation to it gives instance not found if your character is in one of those offline zones you cant log in to that character
wow,not_removed,im not trying to be a jerk here it doesnt matter what you said entire servers are down right now you got a couple lucky logins but that doesnt mean backend blizzard systems arent impacted the way blizzard servers work are not individual computers supporting each server name but in fact shards of distributed systems that are all interconnected if you still have an issue hours once blizzard gives the all clear then you should definitely log a ticket before that theyll just tell you to chill out while they put out these fires
wow,not_removed,disc all day easiest healer in the game that said holy is the most fun spec to heal on in wow and disc is the most boring spec to heal on at least in my opinion
wow,not_removed,do you want to mitigate damage disc or heal after the fact holy
wow,not_removed,holy is about to receive an overhaul and large buff in legion disc is about to turn into the most complicated spec in the game id go holy now and learn the basics holy is really looking fun in legion solid group healing the largest single heal in the game mini lay on hands more than once a minute a good raid cooldown still etc somewhat easy to learn but also has fun artifact abilities and synergies you can work for even better results should be a nice high skill cap but also easy to put out decent numbers
wow,not_removed,disc is generally easier in my book youve also always got something to do however if theres a second disc priest in a raid youre going to hate each other since you cant both cast shields at once
wow,not_removed,personally i found holy to be easier for mans at level you get serendipity which means that after two flash heals your next heal is as fast as a flash heal so you can do fh fh heal rotation at you can take the surge of light talent which procs free instant flash heals at you get chakras and serenity gives you a powerful singletarget heal as well it does hurt the mana though so youll wanna carry around some water with you at all times
wow,not_removed,people generally tend to say disc is so easy and by that they mean brainless shieldspam then you look at the logs that get posted to competitivewow and theyre full of discs with archangel uptimes and holy nova spamming i get the feeling thats the same people
wow,not_removed,if youre in a raid odds are youre not the only healer and your shields are still quite useful if youre part the way into a dot or just after damage congrats now youve just kept the raid up long enough for your groups other heals to save someone also prayer of healing isnt a heal you should use very often on disc it eats up too much mana for minimal heals when you can just use halo instead topping off the entire raid instead of just a group of holys numbers are just far far lower than what a disc can output im assuming if you see people use prayer of healing often theyre using the class trink and its honestly garbage on disc edit apparently people disagree even though if youre spamming flashprayer youve got no mana
wow,not_removed,i absolutely love disc and its only getting better in legion with atonement healing i still use atonement to build up my healing cooldown now and balancing that around actual output ive tried playing with holy and found it unfun
wow,not_removed,i must agree disc isnt necessarily boring but i vastly prefer holy and switched full time to holy part way through wod i also prefer resto shaman and druid over disc and anyone ive talked to about holy paladins says its a ton of fun so disc isnt boring but its the least fun p there are benefits though do damage great as a twink not sure about untwinked might spend more time healing super easy spam shield and youre on par with every other healer penance is super strong for quick high healing theres not a lot of burst healing outside of flash heal for holy purely based on fun though definitely go holy
wow,not_removed,i want to keep my eye on the player tabs since i have difficulty keeping track of mobs and players running around as i get older the sorts of fights i see in dungeons begin to look like blurs of flashing lights and colors
wow,not_removed,legion is fixing this
wow,not_removed,prayer of healing is what you use your empowered archangel on so you definitely should be using it
wow,not_removed,with one caveat disc is getting harder in legion holy ftw
wow,not_removed,why is holy more fun exactly
wow,not_removed,not according to icyveins guides but if youve got a better one then go ahead and link it for me
wow,not_removed,yeah when i heard holy getting buffs and disc getting the changes it has i was really happy i stuck with holy it seems even better in legion and im super hyped for it
wow,not_removed,at level disc basically has things to do spam shield on everyone penance low hp people empowered archangel every seconds of the fight is hitting button and every seconds you hit another button to give people a shield thats pretty much it holy on the other hand has a dot similar to the shield that you spam a small aoe heal heals people that lowers the cd as you use other spells it has poh which you place on people and it heals them when they take damage you have an aoe healing rain type thing to place when people stack up and lightwell is just awesome to have which auto heals people a little bit you also get more freedom in what youre doing in general it just has more buttons to press and has more than meaningful heal
wow,not_removed,sure is generally a great resource for all things priest
wow,not_removed,which spec is the least complicated lets say from to level thanks for the info btw
wow,not_removed,im only a couple bits into it and its already wrong on how some abilities work for example penance does not build up archangel and unless my numbers are wrong then arch also does not boost power word shields capabilities however it does boost the abilities of penance the rest seems alright there but they really should fix that edit also their bis trinket does not proc on any shields and only on heals which i feel makes it more useful on holy than it would on disc where other options that do proc on shields can be used
wow,not_removed,level to in my experience only done it twinked takes like minutes but in general theyre both pretty easy disc is probably easier though
wow,not_removed,wow okay im sorry but im not having a discussion about fundamental gameplay youve just got your facts wrong maybe check out and to see what im talking about
wow,not_removed,the literal guide you linked was wrong on how the abilities worked im not even kidding you dont believe me okay then but the game says otherwise wowhead says otherwise but you can downvote as you wish for it if it makes you feel better
wow,not_removed,archangel does boost shield size empowered archangel makes your divine aegis do magical things with poh since crit gives divine aegis and with eaa the next poh is a guaranteed crit offensive penance builds stack of evangelism healing with penance builds evangelism when using which is why many priests used before valor upgrades i didnt touch your votes at all as long as youre not on my raid team i dont care how you play your disc
wow,not_removed,the exact moment of all your previous posts i got downvoted penance does not naturally build archangel anymore that was removed ages ago seriously look at wowhead look in game try it yourself it no longer does now i could be wrong on the shield part seeing as i also cap my shields they cant go any higher on the targets i choose no matter what kind of buffs i use regardless the guide at hand is wrong on how the abilities themselves function
wow,not_removed,contact blizzard customer support no one here can do anything to help you
wow,not_removed,reddit is on it we will fix your in game issue
wow,not_removed,contact blizzard support use the billing section and use the chat takes like a minute and you can find a blizzard customer support agent
wow,not_removed,i just texted my uncle that works at blizzard issue should be resolved any minute
wow,not_removed,blizz live chat ftw
wow,not_removed,we even hired highly trained monkeys they are also on it
wow,not_removed,dwarf because theyre the best race
wow,not_removed,undead that means i actually used to be a human of lorderan which makes sense for a dk
wow,not_removed,blood elf arcane torrent is a nice little interrupt to have especially as frost male for aesthetic purposes
wow,not_removed,elves i have a blood elf and night elf dk both male most of the time i think males look better with plate
wow,not_removed,tauren i love being a giant cow that and the stun is nice as a tank every now and then mostly the giant slab of steak portion though
wow,not_removed,i created my dk to be my main during lk so i made her human to enjoy the faster rep gains
wow,not_removed,i have a female frost gnome blood nelf
wow,not_removed,blood elf to be the opposite of my blood elf paladin
wow,not_removed,i dont have a dk but if i had i wouldve made it male blood elf or female orc
wow,not_removed,night elf undead gnome draenei so far
wow,not_removed,dranei male currently enjoying str and gift of the naruu also included is huuuuuuge shoulders and hands down the best roar sound
wow,not_removed,male orc because i like big shoulders and i can not lie
wow,not_removed,draenei are the best alliance trace by many many standards
wow,not_removed,goblin dk but have race changed a few times depending on racials was orc
wow,not_removed,human because human
wow,not_removed,just an update still looking for a few people for sometime next week if you have a level horde but need help gearing just send me a friend request
wow,not_removed,what is your battletag
wow,not_removed,resto druid looking to get this pm your battle tag
wow,not_removed,just visit the barber iirc eyebrow typeshape is tied to facial hair so just try different styles of beard until you find one that works for you
wow,not_removed,i know the problem he is talking about and then only solution is no beard at all which is bullshit because i know ive seen male nelf npcs with beards and no clipping eyebrows
wow,not_removed,night elf demon hunters are even worse the eye brows clip through the horns
wow,not_removed,my god
wow,not_removed,man i have been into this game forever and just realized the guard is the l for lordaeron
wow,not_removed,what are you hiding
wow,not_removed,dont talk to me or my son ever again
wow,not_removed,omg
wow,not_removed,haha
wow,not_removed,you could try wowhead if youre new then mythics are the new challenge modes wo the xmog set and legendaries are pure rng once you hit you should be able to pick up your first leggy after doing some world content maybe a raid or two l etc world quests replace dailies and you get a chest after completing of them
wow,not_removed,the hell the dude has the aotc and tries to tank ursoc in the middle
wow,not_removed,dont use dbm to tell you when to taunt on any fight you use it for timers
wow,not_removed,use promote to assist next time d
wow,not_removed,dont give lead to random people then
wow,not_removed,the addon cursoc makes ursoc taunting easy
wow,not_removed,dont worry about as far as advice goes for ursoc turn off dbm i turn it off everytime i get to ursoc dbm confuses the hell out of me because it isnt correct anyways you can use bigwigs i keep that on for ursoc and it helps when things get hectic i set it so its a countdown from when rend is coming easiest thing to do is when person gets overwhelm taunt immediately other tank should be watching as well and as soon as you take rend other tank immediately aggros as soon as he gets stacks of overwhelm you aggro ursoc charges the group you still have aggro and then swap roles you get overwhelm they taunt they take rend you taunt back and take overwhelm they taunt back again ursoc charges group again and its just rinse and repeat while you drag him around the outside of the room but yeah definetly turn dbm off for the fight also when dragging ursoc around the room he should only be shoulders out of the corruption or you will run out of room do not pull him completely out i keep the raid frames by my abilities and constantly watch for overwhelms and rends on the raid frames of when to tauntcall for taunts also dont feel bad because that other tank is a fucking idiot and got carried probably as a dps for aotc if he even attempted to tank ursoc in the middle dude is a retarded and should have the achievement revoked
wow,not_removed,so dont give lead away to people
wow,not_removed,for ursoc taunting tank tank starts off with boss takes overwhelm taunts for rend taunts soon as debuff on ursoc charges taunts when rend at seconds remaining taunts rend flesh taunts soon as cast ends big aoe cast moves boss taunts big aoe cast moves boss taunts for rend taunts back now it starts again with taunting at seconds remaining and repeat till ursoc dead
wow,not_removed,joined a quick clear group neither of the tanks had any idea that ursoc dropped purple when he did roar and the rest of the group had issues with stack up yes that includes you standing near the middle of the room cant heal stupid most likely he got into a kill for xav and hasnt done any of the other fights
wow,not_removed,ok ill keep that in mind thanks
wow,not_removed,thanks ill look into
wow,not_removed,i wish i knew about this earlier been doing the taunt timings via voice chat and dbm timers
wow,not_removed,no i did all of normal en i meant that it was my first time going into heroic sorry i didnt mention that
wow,not_removed,just make sure you taunt overwhelm and rend flesh mate tanks can only take stack if we overlap rend flesh and overwhelm its s wipe
wow,not_removed,no need to apologize that guy is an idiot when i read it i assumed that you had already cleared normal and now decided to attempt heroic
wow,not_removed,did you tank normal or just do it as dps
wow,not_removed,both as my monk and other dps specs
wow,not_removed,yes clearly it reads take her into heroic en for my first time as in into heroic enfor their first time like yesterday i went into heroic enfor the first time
wow,not_removed,yea i definitely worded that incorrectly
wow,not_removed,someones salty
wow,not_removed,theyll be removed in the prepatch you wont be able to earn the rewards anymore and the challenge mode system in general is going away in favour of mythic
wow,not_removed,of course they will be why wouldnt they
wow,not_removed,you have to wait hours i believe then it will turn into a regular account restating the game sometimes fixes it as well that what i did
wow,not_removed,thanks ill try restarting
wow,not_removed,what the user above said is true it can take up to hours for it to fully upgrade your account but you should be able to level past immediately
wow,not_removed,if you really want to feel like a raid boss join an en raid and eat the green crystals on the ground in ilgynoths area enjoy the carnage that follows
wow,not_removed,seems the same to me however it seems like wq are rewarding a lower amount of of ap when i hit rank i saw all my ap wq amount go up and then o back to around the rank value the next day however everything else that gives ap is still higher than it was at rank
wow,not_removed,looks like it
wow,not_removed,sargeras is down for me edit back for now
wow,not_removed,zuljin us is down
wow,not_removed,back now

wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,mainly its about how much motivation and dedication you can bring to this game since legion is kind of grindy but thats a classic mmo feature its about grinding at the end of the day id suggest you start slowly with just leveling some chars up to like you said if you really feel like stayinglegion is great and well done by blizzard just take a look play a game because its funnot because you have to cheers mate
wow,not_removed,ive found its very grindy i played a dh to and was looking for a guild to start raiding with no luck there sadly and then i was working on getting a rogue to as well i wanted to play my hunter to however i know hunters are ass in legion and didnt want to play it to be a main perhaps ill play some characters to and then hopefully thatll either convince me or push me away heres to hoping thanks friend
wow,not_removed,because there would be nothing rare about the mounts anymore kill it times mount is drop
wow,not_removed,then rare mounts wont be rare anymore
wow,not_removed,go horde tichondrius switched over month ago its good
wow,not_removed,good to know havent played literally since bc
wow,not_removed,whats the ratio between the two factions on that server
wow,not_removed,youre very likely not going to get that in a laptop for that price laptops are much more expensive than desktops for the same amount of power
wow,not_removed,find a laptop with a good cpu and with an expresscard slot preferably expresscard buy egpu unit not that overpeiced razer bullshit plug it all in profit
wow,not_removed,first why you wont find a monitor that is going to be above fps in a laptop you can get a stable fps at good that price range but that is about it the fact is gaming laptops have a huge price premium that fact is that generally i would never ever recommend a gaming laptop for most people your just throwing away money you can get a much better pc for and get a cheap laptop if you need a laptop to work on the only time i can see getting a good laptop is if you travel for work regularly so you are away from home for long periods in which case i would recommend spending more than cad i would probably say to get a good one your looking at minimum
wow,not_removed,what about this one
wow,not_removed,the fact is because i move a lot due to school and work i dont want to bring my desktop everytime
wow,not_removed,that would not be that bad your up to a and an so if you can go with cad your not too bad and could probably hit a lot closer to your goal i would probably try to get of ram though but its not a bad one at all
wow,not_removed,yeah then i would suggest if your not going to bring a desktop to see if you can add an extra few hundred to your budget cad is going to get you an dual core with a this means your going to get at medium settings for the most part at you probably would get more outside of raidtowns though and you could probably tweak a lot of settings to improve a lot of aspects
wow,not_removed,im thinking that ill bring my desktop finally but ill need a new graphic card atm i have a gigabyte radeon windforce video card id like to pay less than cad for a new card any suggestion if you want i can tell you my current build
wow,not_removed,probably a gtx would be what i recommend if you can find it that is probably the top end of your price range though you could also go with the as well a lot would depend on what the rest if your current build is because you might gain more with other cheap upgrades depending on what you have
wow,not_removed,typeitemprice cpu memory express motherboard amazon canada memory ncix storage memory express storage canada computers video card vuugo case amazon canada power supply ncix optical drive vuugo prices include shipping taxes rebates and discounts total generated by httppcpartpickercom
wow,not_removed,yeah i would go for either the or the if you have to upgrade the desktop if your not in a hurry wait for the price drops the only thing that might be nice would be a second ssd to store your main games on but that is a personal preference because i hate load times it wont really improve fps the is going to just about double your current fps perhaps slightly less
wow,not_removed,i only play wow and on pc i can put the game folder in my current ssd no
wow,not_removed,you can but generally you shouldnt fill more than on an ssd so it would be a bit hard to squeeze them in now that wow is over alone if your careful you would be fine though
wow,not_removed,my ssd is filled at atm and yeah im not in a hurry i can wait for price drops maybe ill buy a second ssd for now
wow,not_removed,yeah i just hate having to be careful with it a second one is dirt cheap now as well it lets me just toss my two or three main games on it it would be one thing if they were still expensive but you can find them for practically nothing now as you can find them for about cad
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,its a known bug that lingers after a greed proc still looks super sweet
wow,not_removed,hahaha well memed my friend
wow,not_removed,not sure about the settings but you can just copy your interfaceaddons folder to give him your mods some settings are server side so those definitely wont transfer
wow,not_removed,most addons are fairly simple set up you can just relay the settings for more complex things you may wanna see if there are ways to importexport strings of code for the settings such as with wa
wow,not_removed,copying both addons and wtf folder will clone settings aswell
wow,not_removed,you can still transfer config files their under profiles if im not mistaken you just gotta copypaste from the serveruser source to the userserver target but i wouldnt recommand it might fuck up some calculation like total gold and such
wow,not_removed,main menu unlock then move to where you want should also be able to adjust growth direction from the menu iirc
wow,not_removed,are you talking about the buffs on your character pane not the regular ones from the blizzard standard ui do you set them up from another place than the buffsdebuffs section because i dont see it there
wow,not_removed,no they dont they are completely pointless now sadly
wow,not_removed,extremely doubtful
wow,not_removed,have you updated skada recently i know i just had an update for it earlier today so they pushed out a patch update it and see what happens or if you did update it you may want to roll it back a few in case it got broke
wow,not_removed,thanks i rolled it back and its working again now latest patch seems to have broken it for me
wow,not_removed,yes theres a set of spiral staircases in that room go up them and the top floor of the library has a portal back to the place you zone in
wow,not_removed,its just like every other instance is there a way out die somehow
wow,not_removed,if i die i spawn back at the same place i zone in
wow,not_removed,there are portals to the zonein in each section for the last section its up the spiral staircase in the room with the orrery
wow,not_removed,citizens of dalaran
wow,not_removed,rhonin was cool in the books and fought alongside illidan casting spells killing demons years ago didnt garrosh kill him a few years ago those books with him krasus and the dragon flights were my absolute fav i loved the lore with the war of the ancients trilogythey set up this expansion beautifully i feel like legion is the direct sequel too those events
wow,not_removed,he went to cinema
wow,not_removed,it really sucks that so many characters died in that particular book and we have practically no mention of that ingame rhonin just kinda disappears jaina is still bent on hating the horde instead of working together towards mutual survival jainas apprentice died etc
wow,not_removed,never forget theramore
wow,not_removed,we know its you knaak
wow,not_removed,is this satire rhonin redhair
wow,not_removed,raise your eyes to the statue and observe
wow,not_removed,from what i just read garrosh used a be created manabomb dropped from a goblin zep killing a bunch of people including rhonin i was pretty disappointed when i found that out he was such a badass in the war of the ancients
wow,not_removed,in the illidan quest where you defend black rook hold you can see rhonin the dragon and the orcforgot their names d
wow,not_removed,read the new illidans book too its not from the same author but continues that story to legion
wow,not_removed,the thing i hate about the books is if you dont read them youre honestly lost on somethings cairnes death was in a book and was a major plot point for why the tauren werent fond of garrosh we barely got any mention of it in game
wow,not_removed,there is an entire cinematic of the mama bomb being dropped must have missed that
wow,not_removed,i dont know that jainas apprentice was ever in anything other than the book theres a statue of rhonin in salamander though i dont think there is a plaque that says anything
wow,not_removed,again i stopped playing wow during wotlk didnt pick it back up until halfway through wod then quit playing for a year until a day or two ago when i bought legion i seriously had no idea seeing as how he died in mopand dal didnt really have any sort of spotlight in wodits kinda reasonable that i had no idea
wow,not_removed,i agree i refuse to read the knack crap
wow,not_removed,well the way he dies is really awesome tho he basically teleports in teleports jaina out then soaks the energy of the bomb so it doesnt blow up half of kalimdor
wow,not_removed,the orc is broxigar the red i had to target to look for rhonin but even when i put an icon over his head i couldnt see where he was
wow,not_removed,wait what really
wow,not_removed,no i saw the bomb getting dropped but it didnt really show the major characters getting killed by it theres no mention that rhonin shoved jaina through a portal so shed survive or that the stormwind forces lost marcus jonathan captain of the guard lots of others too
wow,not_removed,im only surprised because his level of annoyance is second only to medan to me and i had thought the same for most everyone else
wow,not_removed,how do you feel about christie goldens horrible writing
wow,not_removed,sounds very much like something that would happen in dragon ball z
wow,not_removed,iirc he is flying in the back of the dragon p
wow,not_removed,yeah there was a way in old dal to go view past cinematics i forget how it was an npc maybe someone else remembers but ib watched then alp one day and i had read about the bomb but never seen it you could prob also youtube it
wow,not_removed,i may have just read about that in war crimes strange i feel like ive seen it
wow,not_removed,he never bothered me but i have read a lot of hate for him over the years
wow,not_removed,at least medan was never in game and was thoroughly retconned by khadgar appearance in wod meanwhile rhonin and krasus are sitting pretty in northrend where knaaks shitty writing can never be undone hopefully they retcon rhonins whacky time traveling adventures™ via illidan in legion
wow,not_removed,did you read the books
wow,not_removed,it was pretty bad since her books were supposed to be the good ones i gave up on warcraft novels entirely easier to look up more in the wiki
wow,not_removed,yes they are an exemplar of the horrible writing that plagues the fantasy genre in my opinion
wow,not_removed,quite possibly but her arthas story was a fucking trainwreck okay blizzard wants to kill off nerzhul and make the lich king character all about arthas now cool cool ill just dedicate like one page to that wherein historically weak willed easily controlled arthas suddenly wills nerzhul out of existence like im totally fine with blizzards decision to make arthas come out on top there but goldens writing of it was horrendous it was extremely disappointing after all that time since the frozen throne wondering what exactly was going on with the lich king and arthas after he put on the armor
wow,not_removed,but no one does unti the mighty millhouse manastorm comes in to save the day
wow,not_removed,hes practically the definition of a marysue mediocre to slightly above average mage marries super hot girl goes back in time and becomes the mentor to one of the biggest lore characters befriends all the major characters and dragon aspects becomes leader of the mages outclasses the actual most powerful entities in azeroth his writing is horrendous
wow,not_removed,is it just richard knaak or do you dislike all the novels its pretty accepted that knaak is the worst of the bunch
wow,not_removed,just knaak some of the others have been decent
wow,not_removed,assassination equipped i mainly do m with my core friends and pug heroics tfw cant parse above in some fights because no single target dps legendary to carry me ive done on cenarius and around on most of the other heroics that sweet sweet opener dps when you are ap and blood of the assassinated procs bumps initial dps over a million single target
wow,not_removed,this is me
wow,not_removed,rogue sin with legendary boots master assassin relic legendary belt my logs ps cant parse mythic ilgynoth because my guild use a strategy where just a couple rangeds mostly hunters hit the blobs and just them dont want to piss them off just to parse higher xd
wow,not_removed,equipped my highest raid dps was on heroic ursoc assassination for what its worth running epap
wow,not_removed,equipped assassination w traits on cenarius
wow,not_removed,what kind of rogue are you assassination whats your ilvl equipped in bags legendsi swap trinkets a lot whats your highest dps
wow,not_removed,impressive hows outlaw is it fun im currently sin right now really enjoying the burst damage
wow,not_removed,i dont mind outlaw its just far far too tied to the rng of roll the bones for me
wow,not_removed,well that was stuip of you
wow,not_removed,we did he couldnt keep agro he thought we ran in without him
wow,not_removed,if you mean for arena and bgs doesnt matter what type of gear you have its ilvl only
wow,not_removed,for pvp i play feral i just throw all my highest ilvl items on and go ater youll want to drop some artifact traits into whatever you pvp as though so if you only have points in claws of ursoc then you may want to just be the bgs tank until fangs of ashmane get some love
wow,not_removed,i cant attest to any rated content but playing random bgs as bear tank is fun you dont kill anything by yourself but you soak and disrupt its nice to see tanks in pvp and not just as flag carriers
wow,not_removed,is bear viable for what pvp with the proper spec im sure decent flag carrier given you can travel form and kitty form for speed or go bear for tank for bgs like battle for gilneas and arathi basin you just stay bear running circles on the flag thrashswipe spamming to keep enemies off it avioc you tank the bosses very well i might add i dont see them being useless for any of it as for your ilvl it wont matter much its not a huge difference overall power is like difference per ilvl difference for arenas good luck youre completely useless there you might win vs double dps teams if you run with a healer but even then its iffy given most classes have at least some self healing if youre asking if bear is viable for pve yes its probably the tank to have even after our dr nerf
wow,not_removed,the gear doesnt matter as much in pvp like bgs the stats get squashed if youve just going random bgs bear can definitely work i had lots of fun with it a couple weekends ago
wow,not_removed,ive played it and its not really fun doing no damage cant really kill anything
wow,not_removed,i would add that just leading from the front as a guardian can have a powerful effect in the standard bgs call out a plan and then get your big butt right out front to make first contact this often has a powerful effect on the hordes organization which in turn helps produce a win i also like to intercept folks in maps like twin peaks i can delay the holy snot out of anyone even multiple anyones for over a minute a twist on that is to intercept the front running flag carrier on maps that have flags if there are already multiple fcs on your team you can stop the other teams first carry from ever happening all by yourself
wow,not_removed,in instanced pvp each spec has a predetermined stat template all your stats on your gear become completely irrelevant you could enter a bg as feral with int trinkets int weapons and full caster enchants and youd have the exact same stats as the feral next to you with proper feral gear the only way your stats differ from other people of the same spec is you get like percent better stats per ilvl above your gear isdont quote me on this tho as ive never looked for a source on the exact numbers so if your average item level is youve got better stats than you would if you went in with fresh greens the only piece of gear that really matters is your artifact since the traits all work in pvp and function the same in it in most cases
wow,not_removed,as a rogue i lose agility in pvp
wow,not_removed,well lets start with the obvious do you have your foreground fps limit set to i get fps at with all settings maxed on
wow,not_removed,are you running stuff on ultra whats the resolution the alliance garrison is really rough on fps especially with everything maxed
wow,not_removed,gonna say it right now its probably your drivers the just came out driver support wont be that hot atm
wow,not_removed,i get around fps on my playing the game on almost ultra with a few things turned off that i dont care about like sunshafts and motion blur when im in ashran or a raid and shit is really hitting the fan i go down to about fps due to particle effects so if you ask me i would say it probably just has something to do with how the game is designed not so much your card especially considering i get fps in a game that is much more graphically demanding like the witcher and up to fps in elite dangerous
wow,not_removed,gsync
wow,not_removed,do you have vsync enabled esc graphics vertical sync edit oh never mind saw that you get outside
wow,not_removed,have you plugged your hdmi into your mobo or your gpu also is psu sufficient for a and that
wow,not_removed,turn off the antistatic filtering option at the top i have a ram and an i run ultra at i have a psu
wow,not_removed,what is your render scale set to
wow,not_removed,hey man you still have problems with this have you checked your render scale
wow,not_removed,i have the same problem as you did you find a solution
wow,not_removed,i have only fps on heroes of the storm with a gaming msi at blizzard games bad optimized
wow,not_removed,ive got the same problem on my geforce ssd drive ram i get on ultra almost everywhere but when i idle in my garrison the framerate drops to ashran is a problem too if there are many players it crawls to ive got a pretty old cpu though which i am sure is a huge bottleneck intel quad from year
wow,not_removed,what monitor do you have
wow,not_removed,no limit just trying to run it at
wow,not_removed,running at pretty much every thing maxed but this card should be able to run wow better than it is
wow,not_removed,that was my guildees were thinking too i uninstalled the using cscrub or something like that getting ready for work so gtg downloaded real temp and evga precision to make sure it wasnt heat the hotest it got playing wow was degrees celsius
wow,not_removed,more players you need more power from cpu not gpu
wow,not_removed,thats really weird because i can play the game on high with fps with a card on a laptop i think you definitely forget some settings somewhere
wow,not_removed,still playing with a fancy intel quad from i need to upgrade it sooner or later
wow,not_removed,i have an asus dont think it has gsync had an old before the werid thing is i believe i got the same fps if not better with it tried scanning and repairing renamed wtf and interface with bak too
wow,not_removed,ye is plenty
wow,not_removed,its the recommend psu for it at least according to nvidia using dvi since dont think i can go past with hdmi what i am gonna do when i get back from work is disconnect everything remove the card and add another fan i am also gonna try a different pci express cord from the psu i really dont want to buy any more parts ive spent around for everything including another monitor at before the asus way more than a build like this warrants if i have to buy a new psu i am probably gonna yell alot and no its plugged into the graphics card edit another pci express cord
wow,not_removed,in which areas i have similar specs but stepping into warspear tanks my fps
wow,not_removed,yeap it might be this option i had this option at the highest and was getting fps and with aa off
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,yup still render scale is at
wow,not_removed,i tried upgrading to bought a new motherboard nothing just gave up
wow,not_removed,this was my guess i get on witcher with everything maxxed out
wow,not_removed,asus hertz monitor
wow,not_removed,dell
wow,not_removed,did you uninstall your previous card and then run in safe mode if not try that and then do a fresh install of your drivers
wow,not_removed,maybe check to make sure youre not running the game super sampled
wow,not_removed,hmm i dunno then
wow,not_removed,did you do do fresh install check box on the nvidia control panel might be some old stuff left behind that is holding you back try changing your power supply too performance both on control panel and and in your system settings also download msi afterburner and check your memory and clock speed if around for clock and for memory i dont think somethings wrong with your card
wow,not_removed,im thinking the same its weird im on a gtx and can play on ultra with fps edit well more like fps in big raids
wow,not_removed,did you ever check your nvidia settings sometimes they override application settings with stuff like dsr or ultra f ancy aa
wow,not_removed,did that and uninstalled the game just to make sure
wow,not_removed,he still should be fine i just built and and a gtx rig and i can scrape off fps in garrison
wow,not_removed,thats not true and it really depends on what resolution you run on my old monitor i had around gpu usage with everything on ultra on my new monitor with same gfx i run usually around gpu usage with not everything on max
wow,not_removed,maybe post a screenshot of your graphics settings something isnt adding up
wow,not_removed,i will when i get home tonight
wow,not_removed,hey grats man
wow,not_removed,private server with its own custom classrace combos
wow,not_removed,holy shit my ears

wow,not_removed,all my servers are up for na
wow,not_removed,well the answer is to keep at it
wow,not_removed,i assume youre talking about the unholy appearance
wow,not_removed,😔
wow,not_removed,no that is not the answer
wow,not_removed,no the frost
wow,not_removed,well you could just quit trying and then not get it ever
wow,not_removed,uh you shouldnt have any problem w frost drop rate is got it on my dk alt this week
wow,not_removed,what is your artifact knowledge it requires ak level to drop
wow,not_removed,it has a drop chance from the soultakers and reportedly drops from icc and naxx bosses
wow,not_removed,sure you can also spawn a withered from rosesaethril and the fox from foxflowers they count as normal herbs as in the open world
wow,not_removed,its great because other people can also pick from the same flowers too if you stock up on seeds then get your guilds herbalists together you can easily multiply the amount of herbs you would have gotten
wow,not_removed,yea we actually did that the other day no one got a rank up quest item from about seeds so i was wondering lol
wow,not_removed,too bad whether you believe it or not is irrelevant
wow,not_removed,didnt play vanilla so no comment there excellent dps for brutallus was more if you were a rogue icc on saurfang was ultraxion in cata was anywhere from never raided siege but was doing in tot skipped warlords seems like legion is picked the most patchwerkesque fights i could numbers will vary and are just general ballparks from what i remember from both raiding and world of logs these are from a warlocks perspective
wow,not_removed,the highest i remember it ever being is some top end warlocks maintaining million dps in soo galakras back then i think most people sustained around cant remember exactly anyway stats were made small right after and in the next raid people needed dps or so to pass the dps check now were back towards the mark so in well probably get another stat squish
wow,not_removed,it did get high during soo in mop and they ended up doing a stat squish though from my understanding they did the stat squish because boss hp was basically at the max it could go so they needed to stat squish with legion though thats not really a problem now so i cant imagine theyll squish again
wow,not_removed,im seeing in timewalk bc dungeons which seems a little high or near what it was back then
wow,not_removed,all numbers are from memory probably not exact numbers go from approx first raid tier to last raid tier i dont think cata numbers are right vanilla bc to wrath to cata to mop to
wow,not_removed,this question makes me wonder what the top dps has been compared to boss hp throughout the years anyone knows
wow,not_removed,thank you all for the replies i was wondering because years ago we had our first expansion in ffxiv and being at the end of that expansion now we are doing about to times what we did before it so i was wondering if it can continue that way or if it would get too ridiculous hopefully it does cause i love feeling op
wow,not_removed,i hope they do another stat squish in the next expansion or two i really like the range of feels meaningful to get above crits while still like youre doing good damage if youre hitting for too small and you feel weak but if every hit does its way too much i know its all relative but just talking about feely craft here
wow,not_removed,when the numbers get too high blizzard does a stat squish and brings all the numbers back down think its happened twice will probably happen again after legion
wow,not_removed,it has changed a lot i remember nearing dps during blackwing lair on my rogue and people calling it good nowadays a single auto attack at level does well over damage around is average for most raiders if youre lucky with gear and cheese mechanics
wow,not_removed,and still you didnt pick patchwerk fight as an example
wow,not_removed,so were gonna get scaled up for mop
wow,not_removed,the dps is correct but the fight is not it was golden lotusprotectors where the top log is over a fight
wow,not_removed,the stat squish was done because the game literally couldnt hold numbers big enough for boss hp thats why garrosh had so many phases with hp resets because the mythic version otherwise would have had more hp than the game could handle billion is the largest a bit signed integer can be they fixed that problem within the last few years and now wow hp is stored as bit which can hold up to quadrillion were not likely to reach that any time soon tldr is that a stat squish is no longer necessary
wow,not_removed,thats my understanding as well theyve improved whatever was causing the numbers to have a cap so now they can keep going up again
wow,not_removed,thats very high for bc my best as a rogue with uptime on bloodlust against brutallus was was possible in hyjal with warglaives and the priest mc buff on a very short fight
wow,not_removed,yes i remember being my guilds minimum requirement for trial of the crusader the third tier at im easily pulling that on a tbc timewalking boss sometimes quite a bit more
wow,not_removed,cata is very close high end ranged from to
wow,not_removed,no just once mop wod
wow,not_removed,if you are good at your class and well geared then theres the shadow priest doing mil dps on xavius and the dh maintaining mil dps for seconds
wow,not_removed,because patchwerk was from the first tier of raiding in wrath i chose fights from the final raid of each xpaci dont count ruby sanctum as the final raod of wotlk but if you care excellent dps on patchwerk was my highest parse pre ulduar was as an afflock and we had fury warriors also breaking
wow,not_removed,my bad its been a few years you know
wow,not_removed,as an engineer my guess would have been the type of variable they used to manage health for example the maximum value a long unsigned integer can store is while a long long unsigned integer can store up to with the engine rewrites to handle scaling i would imagine the were able to address the health issue by swapping what type they were using with a new larger type or an alternate system
wow,not_removed,yea thats crazy for bc that was man gear in naxx at around
wow,not_removed,thats because of the snapshotting aspect of chaos blades that they are removing for dhs i assume i think fragrances dh is snapshotting at like mastery which for those who dont know chaos blades is the havoc talent which is a two minute cool down it increases all damage done by x based on mastery and gives your autos some cleave so if you have mastery you have damage increase for seconds there is a new havoc strat where you can equp a massive amount of mastery gear prepull then set a macro to pop chaos blades and then immediately put on your most optimal gear or the gear you normally play with so basically with enough resources or enough farming of mastery gear and you can get insane damage increases at the beginning of fights imagine an dh with top end gear having their damage increased by for secondsits ludicrous but its being removed iirc
wow,not_removed,patchwerk was from the last tier of raiding in classic
wow,not_removed,makes sense to me raid bosses health tends to go up about between xpacs if im remembering right after accounting for different difficulty settings and group sizes so m imperator and possibly some other m highmaul bosses wouldve broken the former limit as soon as the raid was put in
wow,not_removed,cant argue with that im already mentally chopping off the last three digits of everything just so my brain doesnt explode though id much prefer seeing damage numbers abbreviated to k or m to seeing another stat squish personally all the leveling content just feels so sad now and i imagine itd only get worse if we squished again
wow,not_removed,many scrolling combat text addons allow you to not only shorthandtrim numbers to style but also have an anti spam sort of feature that takes things like aoe and dots and shows the first tick and then the accumulated dot damage at the end you can also set it to simply ignore damage below a certain number
wow,not_removed,naxx was a very small upgrade from sunwell gear in most cases i actually used tier belt and bracers all the way thru man naxx
wow,not_removed,actually did not know this thank you heard fragnance talk about mastery gear often but thought it was for aoe pulls
wow,not_removed,so basicly what warlocks had in soo with tot set yeah blizzard doesnt like it when players basicly equip more ittems for dps
wow,not_removed,and i said i didnt play in vanilla so i cant give a valid input
wow,not_removed,garrosh at end of mop was hitting the health cap they got around it by healing him multiple times throughout the fight via encounter mechanics
wow,not_removed,not a prob i was actually late to find out about it but mastery is havocs best stat next patch so gathering mastery gear isnt a bad thing right now which is good
wow,not_removed,in wod sub rogues would also equip mastery gear prepull to snapshot slice and dice and then swap back to heavy multistrikecrit gear in order to get the most out of their opening burst
wow,not_removed,wait what i thought he only had a single billion hp
wow,not_removed,he had somewhere around on heroic and the max hp at the time this goes beyond my knowledge apologies if im wrong was due to integer limit or something along those lines guilds first saw this limit with raden and how he would heal up during the fight however he would also increase his max hp and there were times where his hp would bug out and roll over to and he would be unkillable thok and garrosh both healed throughout the fight but didnt increase their max hp to get around the hp limit im not sure what the max is now but id wager blizzard has figured something out to increase it past that point
wow,not_removed,jesus thats just absurd
wow,not_removed,considering my guild team hasnt even started yet i think its very cool
wow,not_removed,it is definitely an achievement well struck like a true warden
wow,not_removed,grats guys welcome to heroics
wow,not_removed,hey us too i got the legendary chain heal ring off of him to boot grats
wow,not_removed,our guild downed him tonight too gratz
wow,not_removed,congratz
wow,not_removed,congratz dude my guild just downed cenarius hc and is hoping for a xavius kill on sunday it feels great to feel the achievement and content as a team keep it up and onwards to hc
wow,not_removed,thats awesome my guild argues too much during scheduled raids the gm oversteps her bounds and doesnt let the raid lead actually raid lead she goes afk during bosses to argue with people in the guild for half an hour and shes a healer its pretty ridiculous then the only progression that does happen are the impromptu runs the gm does with a select few while pugging the rest i just realized why am i even in that guild i should leave it
wow,not_removed,honestly fuck all these people that comment on the fact youre still on normal they seem to forget any progression is progression keep pushing no matter what level youre on if you want to do it and you love to do it you will do it good luck on heroic
wow,not_removed,gz
wow,not_removed,gratz guy hoping to get our normal xavius down tonight after we opted to try heroics after getting cenarius down didnt go nearly as well but should get better
wow,not_removed,congratulation enjoy heroics and get good loot
wow,not_removed,my guild just killed him last night going to see the emerald dream after so long was amazing loved it
wow,not_removed,wow our guild did too we beat the first bosses the first day about hours and spent hours just to take him down we didnt get to finish off any heroic though
wow,not_removed,i love seeing guild pictures like this it brings back so many memories from the old days congratz on the kill
wow,not_removed,grats man dont be sad because its normal or its irrelevant for some if its important to you guys its what counts we got our kill on normal archie months before legion and everybody was excited besides being normal and so close to the end of the xpac but since half of our guild started playing on draenor was a hella of a fun for us
wow,not_removed,very cool my guild just went in last night and went stopped after ursoc cant wait for our full run of it
wow,not_removed,we just did it so happy
wow,not_removed,grats man our guild just started normal tonight downed the first boss on the second try the got stuck on ursoc all in all i feel like we did great
wow,not_removed,gz guys in our guild we started last week and yesterday just hit cenarius yeah we are just casuals hahaha hope you do well in heroic
wow,not_removed,gz
wow,not_removed,hey httpiimgurcomwfynhrxjpg congrats to you and your guildies
wow,not_removed,my guild isnt quite as geared as me so it has been a bit of a painful process to do normal hoping to get it down sunday d
wow,not_removed,congrats mate
wow,not_removed,any progression is cool grats
wow,not_removed,still struggling with normal cenarius the fight is much harder with sub dps congrats tho
wow,not_removed,i have to say that the lore nerd in me freaked out in that final room after the nightmare cleared seeing all the concept art from the vanilla artbook finally appear in game was one of the coolest wow moments ive ever had i spent a solid hour exploring the dream looking for easter eggs
wow,not_removed,you are my everyday heroes grats cant wait to be there as well
wow,not_removed,uh so guys im staying in the dream see yall next xpac
wow,not_removed,woo grats few things are finer than the feeling of that first raid clear with your guildies
wow,not_removed,we got our first kill yesterday it was the most perfect of kills not a single dead not a single fully corrupted player almost everyone got to corruption before leaving the dream except dpsers on the very first dream it was perfect execution i say
wow,not_removed,me and my guild beat it last night for the first time too its always awesome to experience something like that with your friends and just enjoy the moment
wow,not_removed,grats to all that fight gets pretty hectic especially towards the end
wow,not_removed,thats pretty sweet now get to heroic better loot awaits
wow,not_removed,congrats man i should have gotten a guild pic when we did it too
wow,not_removed,i find it a bit silly that this screen doesnt have any difference from a screen with people in the same spot after killing mythic xavius p but grats of course our guild cleared normal too yet can barely kill more then boss in heroic
wow,not_removed,grats i like this you guys set yourself a goal and achieved it that is something to be proud of
wow,not_removed,congratulations i appreciate this more than the nerds who beat all the content in hours
wow,not_removed,gg
wow,not_removed,grats man were currently progressing on him on heroic hes a real bitch
wow,not_removed,my guild got it for the first time tonight too but i had to be absent due to work here a stay
wow,not_removed,poor guy hetalia is taking the photo
wow,not_removed,we downed him last night too we like to go in blind and figure the strats out got him in attempts just barely though
wow,not_removed,gg
wow,not_removed,mine too its cool to me at least
wow,not_removed,it is cool man really cool gz i dont even have a guild to raid with
wow,not_removed,ha thats amazing my guild is right there with ya
wow,not_removed,we do it with only druids and we get the shit for it most of the time bah its easy you guys have all roles but like yourself were just a casual guild its sad to see casual guilds despite having a lot of fun get the shit for it good going you guys congrats were on with only druids ourselves and so far had a lot of fun dont listen to idiots who give no shits unless its worlds first in vanilla lol
wow,not_removed,i think its awesome man i havent even been able to try yet and am not part of a guild so good for your guys congrats
wow,not_removed,mine killed him last night too d
wow,not_removed,grats my guild did the same last night going to give heroics a shot tonight
wow,not_removed,hey congrats we killed him last night too
wow,not_removed,its always cool when youre slaying internet dragons with your friends lol that spot is perfect for screenshots i hope they keep doing these sort of victory zones at the end of each raid
wow,not_removed,grats man awesome
wow,not_removed,considering im just starting to recruit for our casual raid team this is cool
wow,not_removed,great job
wow,not_removed,it is incredibly cool any accomplishment is great we are still casually working through things great job
wow,not_removed,grats
wow,not_removed,congrates my guild managed to down xavius normal last week after failing day second after killing the dragons and cenarius it was an impressive feat as we consider ourselves a casual guild especially being on argent dawn where almost our whole guild raid consists of people whove done about a decade of rping either quit taken a break or still going strong we managed to kill him with just barely people still alive both tanks dead before one of them died after the fight it was hilarious but still felt so good i love the aftermath of emerald dream ive never seen a raid leave you like that showing you the impact you had in clearing it we explored the area for quite a bit before we left and i cant wait to see it again should we down xavius this week
wow,not_removed,dont forget to catch a new pet
wow,not_removed,i wonder what that feels like here i am still spending hours and hours trying to even get into a fucking group as a melee dps and then when i do we all wipe on eye even though its the easiest fucking thing on the planet
wow,not_removed,congrats man
wow,not_removed,congrats we downed hc xavius last night after hours enjoy heroic
wow,not_removed,grats my guilds currently only been able to reach xavius by pugging more heals and dps only in a pure guild group been painful but were trying for dragons next
wow,not_removed,good job normal heroic or mythic if you clear the raid your doing pretty good
wow,not_removed,props man well done my guild is atm but man the vagina tree takes us soo long to kill currently stuck on him again
wow,not_removed,grats dude my guild is normal right now hopefully we get xavius in just a couple weeks
wow,not_removed,mine did too our gm has the picture though i forgot to take one while posing
wow,not_removed,my guild is going to try downing him and cenarius tonight
wow,not_removed,we took the exact same picture when we downed it
wow,not_removed,great job keep it up and gl with heroic
wow,not_removed,now to grind out that aotc achievement good luck
wow,not_removed,tell that worgen hunter i think his strikers garb transmog is the tits shit takes forever to get
wow,not_removed,its still an accomplishment bravo zulu
wow,not_removed,good job not everyone is in a uberpushing guild i know mine is still working on this encounter i missed our first attempts at him last night
wow,not_removed,untold retribution on moonrunner man i remember when i was playing wow like a job trying to get into their raid set congrats
wow,not_removed,congrats my guild hasnt ran any raid since ulduar
wow,not_removed,we had him down to what even is that hopefully get him later this week
wow,not_removed,i think that people get so caught up in the mythic mindset that they forget there is a significant amount of the playerbase that finds normal challenging its not just there to provide gear for people before they do heroic you can do something my raid team cant yet and i think thats awesome
wow,not_removed,grats op mine got it last week too good vibes all around
wow,not_removed,thats awesome congrats need to find a more active guild mine is not planning anything any time soon
wow,not_removed,while i am happy for you and your guild this type of post seems like it belongs on twitter or something not really any discussion to be had here and weve been inundated with these sinceforever especially since its always other people may not find this impressive but im so proud like if you were why do you need to post it for validation hes just sharing dont be a dick why doesnt he just tell trade chat or something then instead of going out of the game theyre likely to care just as much you just dont get the upvotes not like it matters i guessbetter than seeing the same screenshot of highmountainthe same funny quest textpixelated suramar memes i supoose is the loose moderation over weve fully become rfunny with some wow stuff
wow,not_removed,grats
wow,not_removed,what if i told you i led a pug and killed it in that pug last week xd
wow,not_removed,thought i might have just found someone in my guild mine also downed him tonight on normal and took the same guild pic grats on your kill and the many to follow
wow,not_removed,congratulations my guild did the same tonight and our group was ecstatic good luck in heroic
wow,not_removed,my guild just did it on tuesday its a good feeling went on heroic wednesday im having a lot of fun with this tier so far
wow,not_removed,congratulations got an identical pic httpimgurcomaymhma
wow,not_removed,congrats its quite the achievement i wish my guild could get it together enough to do it had to go through openraid to clear it
wow,not_removed,lol
wow,not_removed,youre right its not cool
wow,not_removed,grats i joined my guild on their second run of en last wednesday on the reset i had only done a few bosses as a dps in pugs as i main tankadin but dont like going in blind but they needed a second tank so i stepped up explained to them i didnt know all tacts and they were fine with it finished the entire raid in one flask duration only wiped on cenarius xavius and spider lady once very fun bosses and great to see the emerald dream edit wow the downvotes not sure what i did to trigger reddit but ok
wow,not_removed,i am sad to say that my guild had two groups formed to raid on the day the raid came out and both groups cleared normal in about hours however i am happy to say that heroic is a bit more challenging with the added mechanics either way grats on your completion it always feels good to complete a raid the first time
wow,not_removed,lol i cleared emerald dream normal the same tuesday it released even did boss on heroic as a guild we dont run but i pug as much as i can the laid back attitude of the guild is what keeps me there im not at an age where id like to be kept on a raid schedule
wow,not_removed,am i the only one thinking what a shit guild
wow,not_removed,spoiler expected tho i guess btw gz
wow,not_removed,you are right it isnt cool i also dont see how openly admitting to being a casual lowtier raider with a nonexistant skill level is anything to be proud of sharing
wow,not_removed,those lowest setting graphics tho
wow,not_removed,same here its a struggle
wow,not_removed,whenever i hear that i think of all the times ive arrived just in time and hit the mob once with an instant case holy fire wardens sure are lazy
wow,not_removed,target down assassination contract complete great work tenno
wow,not_removed,spent both my nonus rolls on him and ilygnoth just gold
wow,not_removed,very nice grats
wow,not_removed,my guild is progressing through h cen on monday hows the fight on heroic are the priorities the same except this time you need to actually free malf during the last phase
wow,not_removed,sounds like a good situation to bail on if you think they might listen you might suggest privately to let the raid leader run the show when the raid is ontheclock and have a feedback discussion afterward for learning content and developing strategies its far better for everyone to follow a known bad plan than it is to get zero useful pulls done due to arguing or afk members if that doesnt work drop your feedback and gquit if you dont feel like sticking around is worth it
wow,not_removed,you should come to our guild alliance on moonrunner us
wow,not_removed,ditch em i havent been in a decent guild in my entire wow career until legion and i cant believe how much better it is with a good guild
wow,not_removed,thats what we did we killed cenarius and then went straight to heroic dps wasnt there yet hoping for first boss or two down in heroic next week
wow,not_removed,nice youll get there just believe and youll get it
wow,not_removed,i have a feeling you guys are gonna absolutely hate ilgynoth
wow,not_removed,try dragons instead for some easy gear even on heroic i dont think we ever wiped on it its a pretty easy fight
wow,not_removed,we got stuck on ilg and ursoc too for a while the biggest thing on ursoc seems to be having enough dps and making sure your melee back off when he charges because theyll get the momentum debuff just keep pushing through we just cleared normal last night with our small group and its great to finish after wiping and struggling so much
wow,not_removed,our first night went like that but we had a great last pull an down ursoc just before we had to call the raid it was pretty great last night we did dragons first pull but then got stuck on vag tree the rest of the night
wow,not_removed,yeah cenarius is an interesting fight a lot going on at once probably my favorite fight in the en so far sub dps will certainly be a bottleneck for you might i suggest you purchase some of the over priced flasks and potions that i put on the ah recently should help
wow,not_removed,too true one of the best feelings
wow,not_removed,too true my friend
wow,not_removed,a wins a win
wow,not_removed,same here heroic is certainly a step up from normal
wow,not_removed,heroic seems to be more about dps checks than anything weve got the mechanics down on the fights but keep hitting the enrage timer
wow,not_removed,my group was able to onenight normal on tuesday so were starting on heroic nythendra wasnt bad but il had his way with us for about two hours before we called it trying ursoc and dragons next week instead
wow,not_removed,absolutely while i appreciate that those players are highly skilled i think its much more rewarding to see a group of people play to a more realistic standard and still overcome challenges
wow,not_removed,i didnt either until i recently found one on the wow lfg forums plenty of different kinds of guilds are always recruiting go find yourself a good home
wow,not_removed,yeah man if you still have a toon on the realm we really need a ranged dps add me on btag if you have questions
wow,not_removed,get a new guild
wow,not_removed,youll get him down this week for sure
wow,not_removed,move to moon runner alliance us we will gladly take you
wow,not_removed,who do you think you just found
wow,not_removed,thanks you do the same
wow,not_removed,how did you take such a small screenshot
wow,not_removed,you mean to tell me that you did pulls trash in one hour
wow,not_removed,dont cut yourself on that edge dude
wow,not_removed,am i the only one thinking nicinthehouse is a moron
wow,not_removed,they accomplished what a lot of pugs have also done so youre not wrong just too honest for this feelhappythread
wow,not_removed,because he is happy about it why does it matter no need to be a giant dick bag about it
wow,not_removed,theres a silver lining my guilds about to spend hours without breaks wiping on mythic nythindra on a damn friday night when i could be just enjoying myself doing wqs and leveling alts
wow,not_removed,well maiev stole the kill on illidan so its definitely a precedent of the wardens
wow,not_removed,jesus i played well over hours of warframe in early beta this triggered me
wow,not_removed,didnt expect rwarframe to leak upvotes for space mom
wow,not_removed,i hate that its not even enough gold to pay for the wasted token
wow,not_removed,its rough big dps check and the ticking debuff hits really hard we basically prioritized wisps and tree the vines go everywhere hope you brought classes with immunes if you can reliably reach you should be fine getting theres the tough part
wow,not_removed,we didnt free him we popped lust at and threw everything at him and killed him before we wiped
wow,not_removed,i thought about talking to the gm about issues i believe the guild is having but then i realized im just a healer and can probably find another guild faster than it would take for me to get her to listen the funny part is most of us healers and the tanks all agree that she is an issue but shes too stubborn to listen to anyone i went and did a mass exodus of my characters from the guild right before i saw your comment i honestly would have loved to have a talk with her about these issues but like i mentioned she doesnt really listen to anyone
wow,not_removed,every raid needs a guy who has the authority to say you know what this might not be exactly right but were gonna try it for a couple pulls and see what happens
wow,not_removed,im too broke to even transfer thankfully im on area horde so theres no shortage of guilds
wow,not_removed,thats what we did too were also gonna clear normal next week before starting heroic because we have some people who are fairly undergeared
wow,not_removed,thanks for the encouragement i honestly didnt think we would get to a second boss in our short hours of raiding we had a few first time raiders as well ursoc was a good dps check for us we are a little lacking in that respect but in he best of our attempts we did get him to i know we will down him next time
wow,not_removed,we cleared easy breezy up until ilgynoth only having to try the bosses till that point a few times tops that fleshlight set us back a few nights for sure and in my opinion more of a dps check than ursoc
wow,not_removed,i have heard
wow,not_removed,ill have to suggest it thanks
wow,not_removed,buying allllll the flasks off the ah p
wow,not_removed,i dont want to be rude or something but why is it a step ive heard that pugs are able to clear hc
wow,not_removed,agree we had our first real night in heroic last night and got dragons down in two attempts then wiped in the second reset of adds of ilgynoth a few times so much damage after that we wiped on ursoc for about an hour getting him to a few times hopeful that will we be on our next night heroic is a good increase in difficulty
wow,not_removed,you mean like hard enrage timers where the boss gets mad and oneshots the whole raid cause if youre hitting those without people being dead then your raid dps is seriously atrocious
wow,not_removed,i actually do i mainly play healers druid tree life but i do loves me some warlock too bad affliction is meh
wow,not_removed,for some reason it doesnt seem to be pushing the rq through so is mine
wow,not_removed,i think we will got cenarius on the third try yet cant seem to burst fast enough in xavius phase
wow,not_removed,the photo didnt upload properly ill try again
wow,not_removed,or hes an alchemist
wow,not_removed,flasks last two hours or is that just an alchemist thing
wow,not_removed,i mean to be fair our normal mode clear this week took like an hour and tops
wow,not_removed,i dont know if hes a moron but hes definitely an asshole
wow,not_removed,so its true that the masses band together in a huge pig sty of casual gaming
wow,not_removed,indeed part of me wishes i was in a slower guild
wow,not_removed,fair enough i have had a good time tonight playing casually and levelling with friends most of this game has never been about hardcore raiding for me but i hope my guild can close the gap a bit id like to at least enter the raid with a majority guild group at some point
wow,not_removed,speaking of whatever happened to that quest where you get to control illidan while hes being raided i saw a clip of that from beta but i never found the quest ingame
wow,not_removed,or did it reactivate you as a sleeper cell must farm primes
wow,not_removed,nothing says fuck you more than spending on a roll only to be rewarded with gold
wow,not_removed,i meanwhy would they just pay you back it would make it a free opportunity it has to cost something
wow,not_removed,gotcha so getting to is the tough one is just a burst phase then just like on normal or do we focus on getting malf free dps wise we have everyone above with a few hitting around sustained
wow,not_removed,heh i pretty much expected that to be your answer you shouldnt have too much trouble finding a guild as a healer good luck man on the other hand if your guildmates all agree that the leader is a problem you could all just start your own guild with a less problematic leader most people are long on talk and lacking when it comes to action though
wow,not_removed,precisely this should be the raid leader however it sounds like hes being undermined or walked over by the guild master odds are he has a combination of a young inexperienced or narcissistic guild master and a timid or inexperienced raid leader most of that can be fixed with feedback and time however itll really depend on the gm to shape up from the description provided
wow,not_removed,on horde as well our guild downed cenariushc and only reached top on the server so theres plenty of competitive guilds for you to look into our gm rarely says anything while we are raiding and lets our raid leaderlead that raids its a great balance id leave if i were you doesnt sound fun gl tho
wow,not_removed,just as a reminder from someone that recently started raiding again and is doing normal runs with people with little to no gear nor knowledge spider boss eleref something might be easier we managed to down it after tries whilst we were also like you strugglign with ursoc because of dps lacking so yeah i would maybe try her out first if you feel you lack gear as the spider boss wasnt really a dps check i felt more like dont fuck up on mechanicspoison spreading and adds
wow,not_removed,i agree your dps and healers have to be on point and dealing with priority add spawns is a must we had to lust after we ran out the first time but were able to still take him down ilgynoth is the real nightmare of the emerald dream
wow,not_removed,we did it on heroic last night too first time win its more of a tank swapping kinda fight i think so might be easier to manage
wow,not_removed,im not saying its impossible but its also not as easy as normal took quite a few more attempts just to get the first boss down
wow,not_removed,hc generally has one or two more mechanics plus the mechanics actually matter when my guild was running through normal we quickly discovered that many mechanics arent really deadly this makes the fight a joke we one shot xavius ursoc nyth dragons spider this is because of said mechanics not because we are some insanely good group or anything were still a new guild with heroic mechanics usually mean life and death and while there is survivability its generally a bit harder for example ilgynoth is fairly tough on heroic compared to normal which is just laughable same thing with ursoc on normal everyone can do and you wont hit berserk on heroic we want everyone at over mechanics are tightened up for mythic there are generally even more mechanics and the older mechanics are significantly more deadly
wow,not_removed,thats crazy we had the opposite ursoc has never taken us more than pulls to get yet ilg is always a pain for us i think we wiped or times last week on that damn second phase and then one shotted her this week finally youre right though we had to swap to heals for ilg with all that damage
wow,not_removed,youll get there man my guild just ran up to were semihardcore but also new i made it around two months ago its been tough but incredibly fun to run a guild but regardless my recommendation is heading for spider before ilgy i made the mistake of making us do ilgy and we needed around thirteen attempts to get him down while every other boss was on heroic
wow,not_removed,on heroic oh it is for sure we have myself enhancement a havoc dh and a warlock pulling around on average the rest of the dps is pulling around average its a guild group and half the guild is or under so we didnt stand much of a chance but we tried for the hell of it we just finished normal last night
wow,not_removed,we would love to have you as a lock hit me up on bnet and lets talk
wow,not_removed,got it i should be on all night we raid at server time so we can talk anytime tonight
wow,not_removed,phase was tough for us too i tank got mind controlled at literally screamed in vent to kill me and rez me right when i came back up other tank got mced boss was at i yelled at everyone to just burn boss and not to worry about the other tank everyone but the other tank survived
wow,not_removed,just alchemists they usually last one hour afaik you have to have the flask specialization unless they removed that
wow,not_removed,i believe you can pop and they stack
wow,not_removed,hats off to that one
wow,not_removed,wow good job you are so special for clearing content my dog could clear xddd le upvotes
wow,not_removed,yepyou got me
wow,not_removed,you need i believe maybe
wow,not_removed,its still in game get and the naruu will give you the quest
wow,not_removed,i did that last night failed twice despite my health not running out druids kept battle rezzing and then the game just kicked me out cause i ran out of time i guess at one point one druid was alive and he rezzed like people in seconds that shit was on a minute cool down
wow,not_removed,its part of the demon hunter quest chain im not sure if everyone gets it i only play class unlocks at either or ak pretty sure its at
wow,not_removed,pretty much burst but you might need to free malfurion once or twice if your stacks are getting seriously high our kill was sloppy as fuck and basically relied on healers being clutch but in a proper kill wed probably have the dps just nuke down the vines on him
wow,not_removed,some of us were talking about issues with her but most of them are somewhat longtime friends of hers i believe and are just afraid to speak up yaknow i shouldve figured the guild wasnt really going to work out when the gm took us healers and i think the tanks to another guild to start raiding en before we did it in our own guild it just felt wrong im gonna miss the holy priest in that guild she did the best harley quinn voice ever
wow,not_removed,yea that aint happening when i raid lead either i am raid leading or you are but if i am raid leading then i am the ultimate authority on all things strategy while raid is in session you cant let people think they can walk on you or you will never get anything done and everyone will tell you their opinion times before each pull
wow,not_removed,agreed we had more trouble with ursoc than the spider boss week round we one shot him though very gear dependant drakes are an easy boss to pickup quick gear on before ursoc
wow,not_removed,our raid leader wanted the hard dps check first so that people would understand that we need to be doing more mm between raiding
wow,not_removed,yeah elerethe is a far more forgiving fight in terms of dps than ursoc or ilgynoth crossing between the platforms is the hardest part of the fight if you get that down its almost trivial
wow,not_removed,im always amazed by how easy everyone claims spiderbitch is theres so much stuff on the ground to worry about so many moving parts and people dying during transitions and crap we ended this week heroic ilgynoth and ursoc only took pulls but friggin spiderbitch took us
wow,not_removed,well i popped my flask just before the nythendra pull and it ran out midfight on the xavius kill like i said it was a very clean run with people already geared from the raid so our dps was pretty high
wow,not_removed,no you dont anymore im a transmutationist and i get the duaration anyways also a lot of guildies just picked up alchemy recently and i doublt they have any specialization whatsoever but still profit from the flasks
wow,not_removed,they removed it its just something that every alchemist has now
wow,not_removed,its did it yesterday
wow,not_removed,wtf is
wow,not_removed,you can actually fail this i literally just pressed buttons and had no idea what im doing i dont even know what triggers the events i just accepted death to maiev and still beat it
wow,not_removed,according to wowhead there are versions of the quest one for dhs one for those who havent raided black temple in game and one for those who have
wow,not_removed,i unlocked last night and got the quests leading up to and including it right away
wow,not_removed,my druid friend got it too
wow,not_removed,no idea why this is getting downvoted i stated i wasnt entirely sure if it was dh specific
wow,not_removed,gotcha obviously gonna save here for then have yall done xavius yet hows he on heroic
wow,not_removed,we downed ursoc yesterday but with only around secs on the berserk timer were still looking to gear properly
wow,not_removed,some of us were talking about issues with her but most of them are somewhat longtime friends of hers i believe and are just afraid to speak up yaknow ah yeah youre probably better off looking elsewhere then i shouldve figured the guild wasnt really going to work out when the gm took us healers and i think the tanks to another guild to start raiding en before we did it in our own guild it just felt wrong eh thisll really depend on how casual and guildfocused your group is it would bother me especially if i was left out but for extremely casual guilds it shouldnt be a big deal it sounds like you can do far better than this group though
wow,not_removed,yep it really takes a certain amount of maturity to raid effectively the teamwork in raiding isnt about the mechanics and its not immediately obvious unless youve been in a dysfunctional group before
wow,not_removed,yeah ive also heard that drakes on normal is pretty easy we havent attempted it though for some insane reason we decided to go to ilgynoth after ursoc and spider yeah that didnt go so well p
wow,not_removed,thats not a dumb idea good luck to you guys and gals
wow,not_removed,artifact knowledge level
wow,not_removed,yea i dont know the second time my health never came close to running out but it booted me out to the entrance
wow,not_removed,theres a lot to coordinate we got him to about on our last few pulls its basically a big dps race again to force the phase before you run out of dreamtime each phase needs to be done within three minutes or so or else your healers just get corrupted doing purifies and you stack way too much corruption its definitely a really well done fight but really hectic we ended up trying to three tank just to have a spare to soak the add because we were starving for dispels and spare corruption once you can make it to the third phase its smooth sailing i feel but until then theres a lot of room for small mistakes dps not moving from the summons or clumping for the aoe when they spawn improper soaking of corruption ideally you want your best dpsheals to hit seconds before they wake up for the boosted damagehealing poor management of the wall of spikes not hitting addssoaking their pools its a clusterfuck of a fight
wow,not_removed,my guild did heroic xavius last night and heroic cenarius a few nights ago we had more trouble with heroic cenarius but i think it might just be because of the strat we were initially using we found things a lot easier when we kept ranged in the center away from the melee stack and just moved the boss along with the melee to whatever you want to purify clearing brambles with rogueshunters is also pretty mandatory we didnt ever break malfurion out and just made sure to stack tankexternal cooldowns on whoever is getting speared so the shit on the floor didnt spread once you can reliably make it to phase it really isnt that bad i dont think weve wiped in phase on either of our kills heroic xavius was pretty much the same as normal you just need your healersother dispellers to be really coordinated on corruption because people will eventually start getting mcd near the end of the fight besides that it wasnt really that difficult at least from the perspective of a melee dps pretty tankhealer intensive though good luck homie
wow,not_removed,eh thisll really depend on how casual and guildfocused your group is it would bother me especially if i was left out but for extremely casual guilds it shouldnt be a big deal yeah i agree i mean the guild is casual environment while being serious but not hardcore about progression the worst part is we all just up and left to that other guild without a single word to anyone in our actual guild it sounds like you can do far better than this group though i hope so im pretty shy when it comes to initially adjusting to a guild but once i get in guild groups for dungeons and raids i warm up to everyone so i often find it difficult to find a guild i can fit in with
wow,not_removed,its also not about the individual you may have to sit out a fight or two or even for an entire night while progression is done but once that boss is cleared it is as easy to kill it again so you dont have to worry about your comp as much the next time
wow,not_removed,haha i know that pain wipes on the eye currently and closest weve gotten is with blob kills to get back in and finish it off
wow,not_removed,i agree we have a really good raid leader he has played since vanilla he used to be a hc raider and wanted to get back to a more relaxed version of raiding
wow,not_removed,are you blowing heroism in that helped us tremendously skipping the second add in is a huge huge deal
wow,not_removed,thanks mate
wow,not_removed,do you have logs for that i actually have absolutely no idea how someone could do as an uh dk on ursoc and im pretty versed in parses etc i raided server first archi last expac
wow,not_removed,yeah that fight is a pain with a notso oriented group p we seem to have no problem getting the first down etc but after that people start to panic and get hit by fixated blobs etcetc also god damn that second phase so much harder than the first one p
wow,not_removed,i assume youre talking about the phase after you exit the center being the hardest part that is when you should probably be lusting so you dont fall behind right away
wow,not_removed,we downed it russian style healers make sure there is no add when the door opens use hero pots and everything one shot it before worked in hm as well easy boss easy loot
wow,not_removed,if theyre using a third tank to soak the big add in theyre definitely getting more than one if theyre getting more than one they should hero at the start is a pretty easy burn phase as far as burn phases go
wow,not_removed,yeah that one its a bitch
wow,not_removed,lust after everyone is out clean remember there is no leaving a time imo that is the hardest fight to coordinate the time in normal
wow,not_removed,yeah thatd be awesome i saw danish terrace also did this on mythic as far as i could see from the vod they had second left of the insta wipe cast time thats ballsy
wow,not_removed,we ended up trying to three tank just to have a spare to soak the add because we were starving for dispels and spare corruption thats what the guy said i was responding to a specific person addressing a specific problem with a specific solution if you didnt actually read the comment chain i cant help you man
wow,not_removed,i just cant see how dispels should ever be an issue on that fight tbh unless theyre dispelling at or stacks i suppose
wow,not_removed,yeah my raid struggled but thats because were still building up to a decent point in our dps core even then hero was enough to make that phase of the time i think xavius is almost entirely raid leading tbh keeping everyone on point with swapping to addskeeping dispels coordinatedkeeping things moving is all you really need
wow,not_removed,even then those things should not be hand held because only comms should be tanks with stacks and between healers because our dps did blades and stuff fine and were percentile thats great your entire raid consists of players who are as good as my best three players that makes your experience basically utterly irrelevant and the fact that you think the shit that works for your raid would work instantly in a raid with people significantly less capable is pretty funny
wow,not_removed,step one join a guild step two run keystones generally guild dps is vastly superior to pug dps unless you have relatively rare outlierslike people with bag ilvl i heal for my guild on keystones and were all above ilvl generally those who apply are mythic raiders or big into keystones aka reliable
wow,not_removed,get good and impress literally right now most if not all classes have a good mythic spec that is perfectly viable some classes may be the harder sells if you insist on dpsing but even then that might be mostly leftover stigma and if youre a good enough player the numbers on the meter will quickly turn peoples doubt around bonus points if you can somehow spec into an aoe stun or your class has a cr start adding other good people you run with build up a friendlist
wow,not_removed,afflictions is arguably one of the best specs in the game for mythic thru or so the mobs live long enough for dots to tick their full duration and most trash packs come in groups of or which is perfect for refreshing dots on all of them before the previous ones drop off on the average trash pack in mythic im usually around dps and thats possible on every trash pack not like some other classes who will break dps but only because of cooldowns
wow,not_removed,if you were speedrunning the instance frost dk can put out insane numbers simply by mashing frostscythe thatstops working as well once you get to the higher levels
wow,not_removed,play it perfectly and youll do about even damage in higher m just have to deal with some classes pressing buttons and you micro managing about dots dealing the same dps i think destro is the best for general use not great except target cleave but decent at everything
wow,not_removed,dot specs in general are pretty shitty on short fights one global cooldown for the dk frost scythe deals a decent amount of damage on all targets immediately for affliction warlock a dot takes seconds to get the full benefit of the global cooldown you spent casting the dot if the mobs only live for around seconds you obviously dont get the full benefit of your dot
wow,not_removed,hey i play affliction lock and can say something the gear has strange effects higher ilvl does not necessarily mean better dps this is because some items that have high ilvl dont have the right stats i would say if you pay more attention to stats rather than ilvl you will find that you can do respectable dps edit just as an example mastery is more important than intellect even so if you replaced a necktrink with some mastery with an item ilvls above it but with crit yes your ilvl is higher now but your dps will suffer
wow,not_removed,its just a really gimmicky spec your aoe is good and scales exponentially with trash pack size and cleave is okay eg dragons cenarius but blizzard shoved them too far into the master of adds niche two of your gold traits are worthless in st fights soul effigy is a massive amount of extra microfocus macros just to barely keep up in st ua being the only soul shard spender feels weird whats worse is that its a heavily rng dependent spec more than some may think the thing is the spec has a lot of potential its a tanky sustained dot spec less hindered by cast times than most other caster specs but somewhere along the way blizzard raised the white flag and had no fucking idea what to do with affliction effigy while a cool idea needs to be reworked at least one of two of the gold traits needs to be reworked reap souls needs to be more forgiving on soul generation during fights with few monsters in it even if the vast majority of fights are not pure st anymore boss damage is still incredibly important for pushing timers and the like
wow,not_removed,yes affliction is broken mechanically and up as a result the main issue is of our traits being completely useless on any st fight as they have to trigger on a kill it used to be that they triggered on our soul reap in beta but they removed that and did not bother to change the traits the only thing affliction currently offers is stable st damage with high self healing and mobility thats it no burst no aoe unless you sacrifice to much of your st damage huge ramp up rng shard regen and this is just pve dont even bother in pvp any team with a mistweaver autowins for example melee train you before you get one ua off we are gods tho so i guess thats something
wow,not_removed,i love affliction its my favorite spec in the game but i had to swap to demo because affliction has just been so unrewarding to play this expansion im really enjoying demo now so even if its fixed later i probably wont swap back but im still sad about having to swap plus i miss my wicked sweet scythe
wow,not_removed,what was your m dps i hate to break it to you but if youre doing really bad dps as an afflock in content youre just playing very wrong focus less on single target and more on aoe for lower mythics and vice versa for higher mythics
wow,not_removed,you didnt post logs or gear so it cant be said what is the exact root cause maybe its because you have the wrong stats wrong talents your rotation is wrong and so on even on boss fights where affliction should really shine i get the feeling that im missing a lot of firepower this is the reason why it may be you thats the problem
wow,not_removed,im finding it takes extreme gear optimization micro managing and right talents for the situation still probably wont perform like the other specs but it does have usefulness like mobility and consistent damage certian fights will fuck you though like your dots still ticking on dragons in en or denarius which requires you not use absolute corruption more micro management and timing
wow,not_removed,its decent but there arent enough massive pulls in most dungeons for aff to truly hit its best most of the time it ends up being fairly equal to other lock specs once you account for all the single target or cleave pulls mixed in between the aoe ones youll see it in kara though when the mythic of lower kara is out other than that theres a few places where it has a moment of glory followed by being mediocre for quite a long time like in arcway where the first couple of pulls just melt but then there are only a handful of decent aoe options for the rest of the dungeon depending on affixes of course the problem that aff can have at higher levels though isnt the damage having aoe fear as a talent option instead of aoe stun is where aff suffers i do like to use it where possible though since the pulls where it does well are really fun plus soul flame chain reactions are entertaining to watch
wow,not_removed,can you post your talent build for
wow,not_removed,afflictions is arguably one of the best specs in the game for mythic thru or so arguably one of the worst on paper it sounds good but in practice it still isnt better than most other specs
wow,not_removed,well frost is still amazing for and up
wow,not_removed,it stops working right now since with the enrage affix aoeing down packs with frostscythe is the best way to get your tank destroyed
wow,not_removed,further more in most instances the value of the stats are so close it doesnt matter beyond ilvl mastery might be worth int but when the upgrade nets you int youd be stupid not to take it
wow,not_removed,the only problem with stats ilevel is when looking for a mythic group youll get denied every single time unless your above a certain ilevel so until you get to the mid ilevel is arguably more important that stats if youre trying to group up for a mythic and not get declined every time
wow,not_removed,thats why people pad their bags with gear
wow,not_removed,there was a time we could make paladins explode in pvp when they disspelled our dots it was a great time i sometimes killed players at once simply by using their own decurse against them d
wow,not_removed,with a resto shaman affliction is actually quite good in aswell
wow,not_removed,uhhh aff locks are the bane of my existence in arena and insane self hearing so tunneling them seems pointless if you arnt able to get any uas off you should learn to fake cast and every lock i face can easily stack uas without trying and than drain life so fuck line of site personal exp from running frost dk mist in and feral or wind or aff lock with me in at to
wow,not_removed,ua when you execute it well has insane pvp burst couple that with the drain life ticks refreshing ua and you have an incredibly robust healer drain is it hard to execute correctly in pvp damn straight but thats what pvp is all about
wow,not_removed,best pvp fight i ever had was when i was on my blood dk versus an afflicition lock the fight lasted minutes because we both would regen our health so much i ended up winning but it was a hardfought win
wow,not_removed,you self healing is high enough that absolute corruption is fine on cenarius
wow,not_removed,its basically the normal cookie cutter one writhe in agony endless corruption siphon life goserv effigy i dont use sow the seeds because i dont really feel its effective against just or mobs at a time only place i really like it is the start of karas nightbane rune where you pull of those coin tossers
wow,not_removed,see when you have no idea what youre talking about you just come out looking like a twat i play with an affliction warlock regularly were both over ilvl gear im a fire mage and he outputs more than me in general even on single target but how would you know when you only do right
wow,not_removed,just watch this its definitly a viable spec
wow,not_removed,elitistblack hmm seems about right post like he has a clue all the while having none
wow,not_removed,thats why you cc the packs when they go enrage
wow,not_removed,just keep the high ilvl pieces in your inventory i keep them but my regularly equipped gear is below what i can put on i do almost more dps because of it though
wow,not_removed,keep higher ilvl gear in your bag and itll factor that into your average ilvl
wow,not_removed,so keep the high item level items in your inventory your highest possible equipped item level shows up
wow,not_removed,this is true but will still screw you in dragons
wow,not_removed,sometimes i have a hard time justifying effigy when those trash packs are taking and i could be using either of the other traits to actually increase my dps in those of course that punishes me on bosses but im thinking the time lost on bosses is made up in full by time gained on trash but i dont have full evidence for this since every dungeon run is so different
wow,not_removed,single target fire mage being beat by affliction warlock you were beat by the worst single target spec in the game i dont think he is the problem
wow,not_removed,im going to need some logs i can provide plenty of logs saying otherwise saying that you are the fire mage in the situation just makes you look bad actually
wow,not_removed,i never said it wasnt viable just that getting beat by the tank on trash and padding on boss fights isnt exactly useful or better than other specsclasses could be edit for reference mid tier is somewhat arguable in the earlier parts of that range
wow,not_removed,proof is there
wow,not_removed,its hard enough to get your average pick up group to hit the same dude now were talking about a cc chain madness
wow,not_removed,yea same but since im lazy and cheap i just stick with effigy since its useful in raids and i dont want to spend money for the respec tomes every time i do something different
wow,not_removed,people dont want to believe that other specs arent good they wanna live in their shell where only their specc is bad and all others are only complaining because they dont know how to play they dont believe outside of the times there are adds and they will live long and you are full of soul shards that affliction is equal to most specs with less ilvls than them and in single target they are competing with tanks
wow,not_removed,go make some friends that play as much as you problem solved no more complaining about pugs sucking
wow,not_removed,youve got a point there dies to necrotic enrage
wow,not_removed,ah i usually pick soul conduit or phantom singularity if single target is not important which it almost never is i will just respec before zoning in to the dungeon and keep that to be cheap in raids there is no reason to swap because trash is never a problem so i just keep soul effigy on raid nights
wow,not_removed,im mythic and ive done i wouldnt say that is casual the burden of proof is on you and yet logs came from you just made up stuff and youre upvoted thats how reddit works so i dont care everyday a new post from a player returning asking why affliction plays so badly with low damage compared to other specs with lower ilvl and a brigade of nonsayers telling him that he doesnt know how to play and that affliction is good and then you check ursoc hc statisticspure single target unlike mythic version and its at the bottom of damage ursoc mythic
wow,not_removed,either ways he is right affliction is by far the best spec for high m
wow,not_removed,first of all pure single target is not afflictions forte second of all most affliction locks actually straight up play the class wrong they are misusing their reap soul and thus have lower dps do some research finally the single target build for affliction is not rng based so does not have the rare time where you do insane damage if all afflocks ran soul conduit then there would be a few parses with insane dps just based on the rng but its not gonna happen because on average its way worse
wow,not_removed,only in some dungeons hov valor and eye are all much better destruction theyre about equal in maw nl and cos while affliction is clearly better in brh and arcway there isnt really a clear better spec anywhere for warlocks because all are best in different situations
wow,not_removed,its so good that warcraftlogs has no parses of a m with an aff lock if it was by far the best there would be lots of warlock parses of people min maxing in higher m but demonology does the same job in aoe with good single target for bosses while affliction struggles to pass the tank
wow,not_removed,set the statistics to max dps its still to last just over survival hunter max the best possible dps that has been done on that fight if the best player hasnt done the best dps i dont know how else to prove that affliction single target is almost the same as the tanks its even worse in m because affliction has to ramp up to stacks no spec should be in this condition if youre just saying this stuff so aff warlocks dont have a bad image in pugs so you dont get instantly declined youre just lying to yourself nythendra hc which is patchwerk if youre gonna parse best parse i look at this and feel even more sorry for survival hunters and im sure they also have people that think they are in an ok state even tho single target is the most important damage in most fights edit i always played my classes to the fullest i always try to play every specc even if one is only above the other in single target or cleave i did all my research and i read the class discord everyday i know what im talking about every questions my skill but i see no proof coming from the people spamming me with the same information basicly saying nah youre just a noob who know nothing about your class here are my logs feel free to bash me i expect some of your affliction parses
wow,not_removed,the thing about parses is they are self reported if every lock running parses believe affliction is crap they wont run it therefore zero parses
wow,not_removed,i know what max means the problem with max is since afflocks have very little rng in their rotation playing optimally doesnt mean you will outdps a favorable rng outcome from another class it does mean that you will do better than average and be able to do it consistently i also disagree that single target is most important in most fights this is almost never true for progression of your own guild which is where dps rankings matter the most
wow,not_removed,not many people log m that is true but good players are always trying to make affliction work because they know where affliction trully shines and they have seen the number they can pull with lots of trash mobs however bosses almost one shot in high mythic and affliction is the worst st specc in the game demonology with implosion barely loses st dmg from their normal rotation and is still great aoe i trully wish affliction was good because i love to use it in en trash but when i last ran it in m it hurt me to be carried in bosses and i barely pulles more dps than the best dps because even in higher m you cant pull more than mobs or else youre in trouble
wow,not_removed,i trully which it were true but the sims speak for themselves we are consistently bad single target luckily drain life is pretty good to solo quest mobs or else the outcry would be even worse because we would barely be able to do boss world quests affliction had their artifact butchered just before the release and then they didnt change the traits that worked with killing souls and we are left with an incomplete artifact i still believe in the theory that affliction is crap single target because drain life is too good at healing you basicly need no heal and they dont want a raid full of affliction warlocks and healer for the tanks outside of aoe we are no better than implosion demo lock so right now there is no use in being affliction unless were in a fight like dragons of nightmare mythic and we can abuse the absolute corruption
wow,not_removed,its posts like this why i run underperforming specs to prove to people that over time they get adjusted and they really arent under performing there could be many reasons why your performance is what it is relic choice what talents youre running with rotation its entirely possible youre using an icy veins spec focusing on a stat priority that doesnt hold true at your ilvl dont misunderstand im not saying your bad because i have no idea how youre playing im using you as an example of things that in theory could be changed i have seen affliction pull amazing numbers in mythics the artifact needs a revamp for sure its broken as shit for how its designex
wow,not_removed,and by just before release you mean months before release
wow,not_removed,months to fix and nothing done
wow,not_removed,now that you mention it i noticed the other day i also have the full set but i only ever had it a long time ago im pretty sure none of my characters had the armor in their inventory when the appearance tab came to the game i did have the tabard though
wow,not_removed,i got the mail scarlet set in my collection at some point without knowing but i bought the plate set from the darkmoon vendor i just assumed they added a feature where if you bought one youd get both but if people are saying they have it without buying either i have no idea what happened
wow,not_removed,yup i am pretty sure that i did not have them when the appearance tab came to the game either however i know for sure that blizzard is starting to give us old content apperances that we collected in the past but for now it is only the ones linked with achievements i think since their logs dont go back years for instance i was given the fiery crown from wow anniversary in molten core since i have the achievement you might want to check as well for other appearances that were given to us d
wow,not_removed,i wanted to buy the plate one but was to lazy going to darkmoon then on next week i had the mail set
wow,not_removed,downvote this is not an issue that affects many players
wow,not_removed,to be fair i downvoted because app screenshots are against the rules of the sub
wow,not_removed,i thought it came in a smaller glass bubble ive always wanted to do this but i cant even begin to decide what armour set to use for my priest
wow,not_removed,id like to eventually get one for one of my characters but im waiting for them to allow updated models
wow,not_removed,do you have any closeups especially of the face and other sections of the body id like to know how the materials look and if the face is well detailed when you go to the website they only show your the characters with the old models so id like to know if the characters get printed with the newer models in mind
wow,not_removed,i want how do i get
wow,not_removed,how long did yours take to make this looks like a great christmas present but according to their site it may take multiple months if i order one tomorrow id need to be fairly sure it arrives before then
wow,not_removed,i always thought their prints looked too soft the colors were never vibrant enough i guess thats working as intended
wow,not_removed,httpswwwfigureprintscomwow
wow,not_removed,i honestly cant answer my mom actually got this for me as a christmas gift last year i dont know when she ordered it only when it arrived
wow,not_removed,wat
wow,not_removed,ww monks for example when they get their artifact for the first time it is blue however when they upgrade it after completing the class hall campaign the color that you start with is yellow
wow,not_removed,oh odd didnt know that
wow,not_removed,go back to blue then d
wow,not_removed,i did but i wish the upgraded version you get first was blue have to do arch to get blue
wow,not_removed,part of a few class quest lines for the patch i just completed this as a bm hunter fel totem doing some funky stuff in that part of the world
wow,not_removed,help them back up they fel
wow,not_removed,ive noticed that npcs on the wandering isle monk order hall are affected by a debuff from drinking felpoisoned brew probably in preparation for the new campaign quests
wow,not_removed,they also specifically said during that quest that the fel corruption didnt work on the raptors it just kills them
wow,not_removed,nooooooooooooooooooooooo
wow,not_removed,are the class quests live yet i havent seen them
wow,not_removed,hah
wow,not_removed,dont worry as a windwalker monk who also went through that quest chain i can assure you the feltotem menace has been dealt with
wow,not_removed,it was the quests for unlocking the new traits
wow,not_removed,whew im getting rather exhausted from the fel corrupting everything possible
wow,not_removed,then theres a wq on the broken isles you might not want to discover
wow,not_removed,mrlglrlrlrlrlrlr
wow,not_removed,i would say to take it in stride maybe next time ask why hes afk if they all have the same guild tag or theyre all from the same realm its a pretty good bet theyll stand up for each other live and learn
wow,not_removed,all you guys here worried about what happened im wondering why language filter is on
wow,not_removed,i was once kicked for having the highest dps as a tank im not kidding theyd pull in a ton of trash mobs and get mad at me when theyd die instantly then they did a dps check and i had the highest dps and they used it as an excuse to kick me lmao
wow,not_removed,one time i ran through an entire timewalking dungeon as heals and one dps warrior was afk throughout the majority of it i asked if they were coming or not no one answered or vouched for them and so i voted to kick the player with the reason are you coming or not were a premade afk warrior suddenly reacts fuk u k i considered reporting the abuse of the lfg mechanic and carrying lazy players but i dont thing thats a reportable offense unfortunately
wow,not_removed,fuck em not everyone is like that
wow,not_removed,domt worry they only have friends amoung them
wow,not_removed,is there a penalty to being kicked like there is for leaving a group if not then its probably the best situation could report for being afk after asking once they kicked you unsure if theres anything theyd do
wow,not_removed,you dodged a bullet the only thing worse than having no friends is having asshole friends these guys can bring each other down all day while you find better folks to play with
wow,not_removed,always check the guild tags before trying to kick someone doesnt hurt to ask what is going on either life happens sometimes while youre in a group
wow,not_removed,story time i was once tanking zf on a tank i was leveling and i got paired up with friends they were all being jerks and pulling unnecessary amounts of mobs this was before heirlooms made random dungeons a joke so i initiated a votekick on the ringleader of the group with the comment kick the stupid tank they all voted to kick their friend from the group boy were they salty after
wow,not_removed,sometimes you meet fun groups and sometimes you dont thats how its always been in wow just try to be nice to others and most likely they will be nice in return
wow,not_removed,if the tank announced that hes afk for a short time youve been rightfully kicked
wow,not_removed,imo you deserved it dude had to afk for some reason you could have asked if he was there you could have looked properly to see they were from same serverguild and ask them about him you could try to slowly solo a bit of the thing the one thing you shouldnt have done was to kick a person without even trying to talk about it first so yea karmas a bitch
wow,not_removed,probably a group of friends in fact they even said so clearly they knew why the tank was afk
wow,not_removed,gg someone tried to vote kick me while i was playing with my wife it did not go well for him the best part is that he the tank tried to kick me for pulling mobs off of the healer because he wasnt bothering to pick up the adds then says i should let him tank the adds and stop interfering facepalm so yea lesson learned dont vote to kick people when theyre with a group of friends
wow,not_removed,i dont get lfg or lfr at the end of the day the dps killed itself in fire the healer had a stroke and dcd and my blood dk stands alone as an armored god atop a mountain of skulls
wow,not_removed,good obviously i dont know the exact reason why wanted to vote kick someone other than saying they were afk for how long but people who just decide to vote kick people without trying to solve the issue first should be kicked i once got kicked because i linked a dps meter ive been kicked for pulling mobs too fast never wiped whats the issue nobody likes being kicked especially as dps the whole feature should require votes to kick not it honestly makes me feel i have to play as a tank or healer for new alts in fear of getting kicked from a long dungeon wait for some stupid reason that could be avoided
wow,not_removed,cool beans
wow,not_removed,other side of the coin i think its a douchy move to kick someone who afks fore a mere min edit downvotes show how many gogogogo people we have on the reddit
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,personally mine seems to keep resetting to turn the filter on even after i change it or its behaving as a percharacter setting or something theres probably an addon interfering with the setting i choose honestly my desire to see all the fuck words just isnt high enough to bother figuring out how to fix it
wow,not_removed,it makes it funnier to me
wow,not_removed,im wondering why is he doing dungeons at
wow,not_removed,it keeps resetting like mentioned
wow,not_removed,because op is
wow,not_removed,i always have it on that way i can discover people who i shouldnt be playing with about of the time there is nothing for it to filter anyway i see no reason why someone would write profanities that much anyway
wow,not_removed,i had a group kicking me from a random heroic for using heroism on the first boss the bloody point is if it takes more then mins its ready for the last boss and if you clear under mins you never needed the heroism to begin with some people huh
wow,not_removed,why were they dieing werent yoy tanking the mobs
wow,not_removed,maybe you had top dps because you let the dps die
wow,not_removed,ive been kicked for using control undead on the spell flingers in wrath time walking people are stupid and theres no cure
wow,not_removed,exactly why i hate the whole vote kick system so many times it seems like a tyranny of the majority kick hell i know a lot of people who just vote yes regardless of what the reason is my friend was with me once and got mad over something stupid and wanted to vote kick a guy for something that was not reasonable the reason he put was something like this guys a fing bang and it passed even with me voting no
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,damn thats a good idea
wow,not_removed,this is how i get low level idiots who multi queue constantly pull trash when youre tanking and not even close to slow i promise you that
wow,not_removed,doesnt always work though
wow,not_removed,right everyone always seems to insta vote yes on most kicks i see come up without any type of complaint or reason at all a lot of the times
wow,not_removed,username checks out
wow,not_removed,yes there is the dungeon deserter debuff this will only trigger if youre inside the dungeon for less than ten minutes and no boss has fallen so far
wow,not_removed,ok tough guy
wow,not_removed,they could have just said hey were in a premade group and hell be right back we were still pulling with dps and a healer and we werent being very successful so i took initiative
wow,not_removed,and clearly they didnt convey this information and just kicked op instead
wow,not_removed,good obviously i dont know the exact reason why wanted to vote kick someone other than saying they were afk for how long but people who just decide to vote kick people without trying to solve the issue first should be kicked so someone who uses the kick function to kick an afk player before asking about the afk player should be kicked before trying to solve the issue i dont get your logic a normal person would vote no on the kick and explain that hes coming back something came up and he has to do something real quick etc abuse of the kick function is not justified by someone trying to vote kick an afk player without vetting the vote by the rest of his group
wow,not_removed,tank has more or less insta qeue if hes gonna go afk he should not qeue or at least mention it to the group
wow,not_removed,not at all if a player in a pug goes afk without announcing it or telling anyone they should expect a kick after min let alone mins it doesnt take much to say afk a few mins guys brb and i would be happy to wait
wow,not_removed,its like a one third of the instance its rude to the other people
wow,not_removed,a mere min i dont think you understand how long minutes actually is in a dungeon thats moving along if you have to afk the considerate thing to do in that situation would be to just leave i feel horrible when i have to afk for seconds its incredibly inconsiderate for someone to keep other people waiting around for them just because they picked a bad time to queue for a dungeon
wow,not_removed,theyre low level dungeons all you can do is gogogogo even in heroics people just plow through now no one wants to wait minutes and they shouldnt have to if youre afk for more than even a minute you deserve to be kicked
wow,not_removed,yeah i actually cant stand it when players are silent the whole time you could be trying to communicate fight mechanics or trying to ask them a question only for them to remain silent but theyll be the first one to initiate a vote kick very annoying
wow,not_removed,a month or so ago similar situation happened to me as did op was in a timewalking dungeon one of the dps kept pulling and getting himself killed then would release instead of waiting for a rez about two pulls before last boss he goes afk we wait minutes for him and i ask in chat if we should kick him no response and i initiate a vote kick that fails and a few minutes later he finally comes back and we continue pulling it was at that moment i notice theyre all on azralon and from the same guild i play with titles and guild tags hidden we pull last boss and they must have voted to kick me before we pulled because i got kicked halfway through the boss i have yet to have a single positive experience with players on the br servers
wow,not_removed,pretty much i run with friends and we always tell the group if one has to step away for an emergency bio or something
wow,not_removed,nothing sucks more than joining a lfd into a premade and having either the tank or healer go afk for the first minutes of the dungeon its not a huge issue with regular daily heroics but when timewalking events come around this has become more and more common
wow,not_removed,it might be that its enabled in the bnet client think it resets anytime you message someone over bnet or something it kept happening to me and stopped after i disabled it there
wow,not_removed,thats why i leave mine on i could pretend im a big tough dude but really seeing all the stars just gives me the giggles
wow,not_removed,i was doing the level quest for the solium band even if i cant get the legendary before legion drops i can still get some decent stats
wow,not_removed,that way i can discover people who shouldnt be playing lol wut
wow,not_removed,so just because someone curses instantly means you dont wanna play with them
wow,not_removed,its hard to tank mobs when they run ahead and pull and expect you to be able to tank it when youre in lvl dungeons either way youre going to get blown up
wow,not_removed,if youre a tank with heirlooms in a low level dungeon its really easy to have top dps throughout the whole thing
wow,not_removed,the vote kick system does more good than bad in my opinion in blade and soul the vote kick system only works when the player has disconnected so you get people who join the dungeon just to afk expecting the group to do it with less person back when bots were more prevalent it wasnt uncommon to join a dungeon and only have people actually playing and people afk at the start of the dungeon the only recourse was to leave the group and find another as you couldnt kick them
wow,not_removed,most people will vote yes regardless of what the reason is usually i barely have the time to read it before whoever it was is already kicked and more than once someone goes why did we kick them
wow,not_removed,personally ill pull trash on my low level rogue simply because i can survive pulling it it speeds up the run so why not
wow,not_removed,so people can boot you at the start and you get a dungeon finder cooldown that seems a pretty crappy system
wow,not_removed,tough guy because i spoke my opinion
wow,not_removed,and you could have taken the initiative to ask instead of trying to kick
wow,not_removed,because op didnt say shit and just tried to kick the tank
wow,not_removed,it was to emphasize that people jump to vote kick anyone for the smallest thing without asking or saying anything a normal person would vote no on the kick and explain hes coming back andif this person whos afk for a second is solo queing or duo queing and doesnt have time to type anything before everyone votes yes that person is still going to get kicked like i said people hit yes all the time on vote kicks without even having a reason it happens in lfr all the time a vote kick goes up for a random player and they get kicked almost instantly
wow,not_removed,well if there are people from the same guild you could at least ask why the tank is afk instead of flat out kick him
wow,not_removed,if you dont have the time to play and need to rush dont fucking play
wow,not_removed,lo and behold the setting you pointed me to was indeed enabled ill see later if it worked thanks so much
wow,not_removed,my bad
wow,not_removed,curse words are naughty
wow,not_removed,who i shouldnt be playing with p
wow,not_removed,not really but if they do it often i say damn a lot but that isnt filtered
wow,not_removed,sometimes the tank is geared and confident and starts pulling a lot of mobs moving on to aggro the next pack to collect them all this will cause a dozen or so mobs walking a parade behind the tank for meters now if the dps attacks the last mob in the parade he will steal aggro and the mob and the dps fall behind now imagine youre the heal usually you will stick to the tank but if you keep up with him the dps might die whose fault is that well according to lfg logic yours
wow,not_removed,i think the vote kick system is good to have but they constantly are changing the required votes from to i think it should stay at it should be if one person is causing a problem everyone agrees they should be kicked out besides said problem person also bots actually did better than human players in my experience yeah it was weird but they always knew their rotations and did good dps people afking botting
wow,not_removed,exactly people just like to be dicks and kick each other some people say ive never had that happen well you must live in a land of imaaaaaginaaaaaaaaation
wow,not_removed,this so much while leveling i always try and twink all my characters in every brackets because i find it fun to pvp for a break and it helps make dungeons a breeze i understand from a tank perspective it can be annoying but as a tank if someone pulls something i let them deal with it if they kill it the faster the better imo
wow,not_removed,yes i know were all op with heirlooms but you pick a roll play your roll dont go off tanking low content when some newer players might be trying to learn
wow,not_removed,there are some additional limitations to the kickvote system that are not publicly explained you cant just chainkick every new player that enters your party neither can you be kicked again instantly after the debuff runs out even if youre someone whod actually justify that action the system isnt perfect but maybe it is you cant expect blizzard paying a busload full of gms helicoptering lfg kick attempts and most people wouldnt want this kind of intrusive government either
wow,not_removed,which is not good etiquette but no reason to kick him either both parties are at fault here
wow,not_removed,personally ive never experienced people randomly getting kicked from lfr just because someone wanted to kick someone all the kicks ive seen were because they were afk or had pack on and refused to turn it off
wow,not_removed,or get a guild group together
wow,not_removed,i play a lot more than the average person and i can certainly say that im not leveling through instances to stare at the fine detail i want to level and i want to level fast
wow,not_removed,also if you play another game that has it enabled it will change it for other games i noticed it happeneing when id play hots and come back to wow
wow,not_removed,in lfg isnt this where the hunter decides to hit barrage
wow,not_removed,i think a majority vote is sufficient to kick someone that way two idiots cant join a dungeon and make it impossible to complete by trolling their group also with bs bots generally dont have the upgradeable weapon which is far superior to anything else you can get so even if they did actually do perfect rotations their damage is far lower than the average player ignoring the fact that most of the bots just joined and did nothing they had default outfit the same weapon etc it wasnt hard to pick out the bots from the afkers
wow,not_removed,im talking about the late vanilla dungeons where everything isnt linear so the tank can learn just fine about how to tank with me speeding it up by getting rid of some mobs well have to fight at some point
wow,not_removed,the moment you try to kick my friend ill kick you love with love is repaid
wow,not_removed,must be nice to live in your perfect world
wow,not_removed,i dont think is better than because theres been many times where two new players are leveling together and both get kicked for not having heirlooms or some other stupid reason its not right another example of being worse than my friend and i were leveling and we wiped i said gimmie a sec just gonna get min exp buff for firefestival and it was at the beginning of the dungeon so its not like i had to run super far or anything and i got kicked as if getting kicked wasnt bad enough since it was at the beginning of the dungeon we both got a min dungeon deserter debuff heirloom weapons arent mandatory to run a dungeon and is not a kickable reason even though plenty of people get kicked for it all the time also you highly underestimate the average player in almost every group i join im almost always of the groups dps ive never been in a group where a bot joined and did nothing it sounds like you were just dealing with afk players or someone failing at multiboxing
wow,not_removed,id probably just say the tank will be back in a sec and hed probably reply ah ok and wed go do the dungeon
wow,not_removed,i know id say the same however if someone without any previous input tries to kick a friend of mine i wont like it and will probably kick him instead both sides could have done it differently but i think the op had what he deserved
wow,not_removed,fair enough
wow,not_removed,just when i thought closing lfg was enough to get me away from the spam
wow,not_removed,its actually also against the subreddit rules free or paid
wow,not_removed,ok didnt know this count as spam well removed then
wow,not_removed,same with priest no teleport im assuming the druid hall is harder to get to at least palapriest just have to run into a house in dalaran
wow,not_removed,us warriors have got to put our legs to the test and do a giant leap you guys got it easy
wow,not_removed,red vs blue its as simple as that you might zoom through the quests and never get into the lore but red vs blue has caused a lot of problems throughout azeroths history and will continue to do so
wow,not_removed,to suit with lore and pvp fans cant make a game about war from the warcraft series withoutwar from the warcraft series
wow,not_removed,when world of warcraft first came out the game was all about the opposing faction there was a literal divide and pvp servers were amazing these days the two separate factions doesnt make much sense but thats how the game has always been
wow,not_removed,pvp
wow,not_removed,sure but is red vs blue worth completely separating one half of the player base from the rest
wow,not_removed,yeah thats true i never really got huge into pvp but i know a lot of people are into it why not just have pvp and allowed questing and pve with people from different factions
wow,not_removed,i see i guess it makes sense for a pvp perspective but why not just keep pvp the same but still let me play pve with my alliance friends are they ever planning on doing something like that
wow,not_removed,considering that half of wows population is still higher than that of the vast majority of mmos id have to say youre not really missing out red vs blue isnt going anywhere it started in with warcraft orcs and humans and is going to keep on going until people stop playing wow
wow,not_removed,because it doesnt make sense we are at war and have always been at war but lets be friends and kill deer together just make a horde or alliance character to level with your friends it doesnt take too long
wow,not_removed,are they ever planning on doing something like that no
wow,not_removed,makes sense still doesnt excuse the fact that blizz hasnt rectified any of it
wow,not_removed,whoever came up with the hunter artifact skins and hidden stuff needs to be taken out behind the barn and shot bm weapon is lame af then i just go th a vendor and buy the hidden appearance which looks like its made from foam wtf
wow,not_removed,because it is cosmetic people complain when they have to work for things
wow,not_removed,hey man i had to check a macro everyday to know if my artefact would be availlable without that maccro i would have to go to a shitty cave just to ckeck it my other appearance is kept by world boss that change every weeks and the first time i saw that boss i didnt have the ak needed and my last one is a quest that wasnt availlable since yesterday and has absolutely nothing needed to do some have taken it at
wow,not_removed,i think warriors have a bit of a right to complain in this case rng for a drop from a boss that maybe shows up once a month or more is bs
wow,not_removed,amen the fact that arms warriors get a almost brain dead quest that takes mins and me a fury warrior could potentially have to wait months or years is absolutely unfair thank nzoth i was able to get the haft of god king on my first kill im just praying that they make those damn dragon skulls drop rate i can also tell you i already have a little bit of rage saved up if sharthos is the next world boss and it doesnt drop the skull tldr arms hidden appearance is to easy while furys is ridiculous
wow,not_removed,so either they are too easy or too hard
wow,not_removed,bm and mm hunters say hello i would much rather have my artifact weapons hidden appearences be from something else other than buying from vendors
wow,not_removed,neither i dont think anyone minds a challenge and too easy is just annoying to other specs see hunters buying theirs but rng factor on a boss that maybe shows up isnt exactly hard just annoying and out of your control its not like a raid boss where you get to retry every week
wow,not_removed,so u cant have it just right
wow,not_removed,i forgot about that my best friend is a mm and we had the convo of how lame it is we had that talk such a long time ago that i forgot how easy bmmm hunters have it as well at least survival is a boss drop
wow,not_removed,lol yeah hunters are pretty shafted earning shit is satisfying earning shit against rng isnt
wow,not_removed,or it means no matter what people will just complain
wow,not_removed,so were not allowed to have valid criticisms
wow,not_removed,still waiting to see a valid one
wow,not_removed,how is it that you equate rngtoo hard people have a right to complain on that one its a joke
wow,not_removed,blizzard said that all of the appearances were in the game and then the arms one was added today so either they lied about it or they literally just dont keep track of their own game even after people reported to them that the quest wasnt properly flagged to be activated
wow,not_removed,i never said that rngtoo hard
wow,not_removed,then you have the fact that frost dks havent even had so much of a hint as to where to even start looking for theirs
wow,not_removed,eiher too easy or too hard in response to my criticism of an rng drop for warriors thats what most people are complaining about is rng that is out of their hands i think many would be fine with a challenging questline even if it took long im saying that certain specs have it too easy and it makes it a joke that classes that just have to rely on getting lucky are screwed
wow,not_removed,after the arms thing happened id just wait for nighthold or something its probably not in at all yet
wow,not_removed,oooooh
wow,not_removed,lfr gear damn that seems high
wow,not_removed,prot warriors still on suicide watch
wow,not_removed,so now lfr gets gear comparable to heroic nighthold
wow,not_removed,bonus death coil causes one of your army of the dead ghouls to explode dealing damage to up to nearby enemies well thats just silly its not like i can get those zombies very oft bonus each rune you spend reduces the cooldown of army of the dead by seconds ah could probably use more bonus though seems a bit inadequate especially since the cd for aotd is minutes
wow,not_removed,holy shit thats literally a ilevel jump up from nh on the same difficulties legendaries will most likely be bumped up to i think theyre doing this because they dont want guilds who have h nh on farm titanforged lel to streamroll through n and h tos also no wonder they tried to implement mob scaling with ilevel people flying around in tos gear will just be murdering mobs by looking at them and blizzard are trying to keep wqs relevant to ongoing content
wow,not_removed,new warrior bonuses look horrible compared to the current tier bonuses
wow,not_removed,looks like ill be sticking to as disc and just pick up the for raiding that looks pretty nice for m though now i have to hope i dont get any tierslot legendaries holy on the other hand has a solid looking it looks way more impactful than the additional chance to overheal more than it already does as for shadow didnt most shadow priests complain about the set bonuses making them into essentially a pet class this looks like a repeat of that but with more minmax potential which might rub people the wrong way
wow,not_removed,vengeance demon hunter tier is fucking awful
wow,not_removed,vengeance dh blood dk get shafted with old lfresque secondary stat increases after using insert ability here where gdruid gets reduction on frenzied regen based on ironfur and mark of ursol usage dont get me wrong the and versatility on each is nice but seems underwhelming compared to other tanks bonus
wow,not_removed,it kinda sucks that bm got the mechanically best possible set bonuses so early now were going to be stuck with all these spiky damage increases until the end of the expansion
wow,not_removed,am i the only one feeling deja vu about a lot of the recent movements on blizzards side of thingsthe resulting commentary in the community
wow,not_removed,the enhancement bonus looks odd as heck but i guess i can see what theyre trying to do it makes crit a much more valuable stat instead of trash plus it makes our aoe not ass plus this piece synergizes with the nh piece if there is room for all pieces i dunno its a weird set and perhaps enhancement will get changes by the time tos hits that make this make more sense
wow,not_removed,pretty lack luster affli lock bonus for channeling a full drain soul as a piece and demo locks get to basically make their actually feel smooth for once come on this cant be what were sticking with
wow,not_removed,we decided that convergence of fates and the breath of sindragosa playstyle for frostdk is so engaging that were baking the effect into tombs for when we inevitably nerf the ability for convergence to work beyond nighthold
wow,not_removed,affliction warlocks still on suicide watch looking at their set
wow,not_removed,im not sure if im reading something wrong but the assassin rogue set looks like utter garbage
wow,not_removed,that ww monk bonus is so lame
wow,not_removed,what in gods name are they thinking with the assassination set
wow,not_removed,im glad to see this lfr increase now people who join late can get lfr gear and attempt mythic nh right away if they want this is good for people trying to have fun for all you angry elites out there these people wont be bringing you down because these are the people who dont raid hard anyway you will still be better than them so calm down elitists there is a week period of lrf unlocks anyway
wow,not_removed,titanforging and the level of the gear the players has is ruining our vision of world quests make the enemies stronger the strength of the players weapons isnt enough we have to boost the level makes gear stronger titanforging and the level this is the bed you made blizzard with this stupid titanforging and legendary system like did you seriously step back and thinkya this wont create power creep ffs a year old with basic math skills could have figured it out i dont know who your math guys are but you pay them too much
wow,not_removed,damn moonkin and set looks like a damn good set asp mean we can drop starfalls at once with a saved oi proc and then another starfall quickly
wow,not_removed,survival
wow,not_removed,survival bonuses seemhm the feels like a nice enough boost and not having to spend focus and a cd on refreshing is pretty good but the comes across as lackluster especially in comparison to the nh do the damage you were going to do over seconds in one second or increase all damage you do for seconds including subsequent mongoose bites at six stacks itll probably be a net dps gain but imo its a bit more fun seeing my damage go nuts once i hit six stacks
wow,not_removed,uh dk pieces is so bad
wow,not_removed,finally some love for holy priests really hoping that doesnt get nerfed cuz thats a huge throughput increase the pc seems decent essentially less serendipity trigger per hw on a piety build
wow,not_removed,this is odd so the item level say for normal nh is above mythic nh lets say normal tos is made for players in normal nh gear so its designed around players in ilvl thats a huge jump item levels what happens to those who have full tos normal gear move on to heroic i guess thats okay its just weird legion and its gearing is probably he most absurd of every expansion i played so far
wow,not_removed,havoc this makes me wonder if i can unequip anger with the fury gen id get from
wow,not_removed,can anyone repost this for those of us at work
wow,not_removed,as a havoc dh main im seriously not stoked to be tethered to first blood for yet another tier what a lazy set bonus
wow,not_removed,welp ele sham set sucks horsecock hey look your dot deals a bit more damage while a major cooldown that doesnt add that much damage is active and it reduces the cooldown on that major cooldown the set bonus is waaaaay better
wow,not_removed,could workbros get a copypaste
wow,not_removed,ilvls per tier is a but much isnt it
wow,not_removed,shit with those demo set bonuses im sure recurrent ritual will be nerfed
wow,not_removed,rip thisll put vengeance even further behind
wow,not_removed,most of the bonuses look like shit is blizz running out of good ideas for set bonuses
wow,not_removed,destro piece is deceptively strong im not sure why no ones mentioned it yet
wow,not_removed,if you need to actually have friend players targeted for the holy paladin bonus to work im probably not gonna use it what a shitty set bonus
wow,not_removed,i know i will be sticking to my on my guardian hopefully nh can tf up to tos gear so i can keep equipping is boring as hell
wow,not_removed,i am a simple man i see busted af demonology set bonuses not getting nerfed i upvote
wow,not_removed,i dont really want raid finder for to give gear the same level as heroic it feels pointless to do the harder modes if im going to be able to just mindless raid finder my way to that same level as soon as the raid is out
wow,not_removed,omfg lfr welfare lol wtf bbq reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
wow,not_removed,the trend continues ret paladins are the worst of all dps classes good thing i switched mains or i would be pissed sorry rets out there blizzard hates you now
wow,not_removed,does seem kind of high im guessing they assume by the time tos hits servers everyone will be around since lfr nighthold is
wow,not_removed,back to back mediocre tier set bonuses for the the expansions raid tier having a majority of magic damage at least is good with any multiple add tanking situation and also our golden trait isnt half bad somehow devs let that go through
wow,not_removed,lfr should be at least lower then heroic of the previous tier i hope this gets changed
wow,not_removed,so the same as lfr nighthold being comparable with heroic en thinking
wow,not_removed,do we have an idea on what ilvl is required to run lfr in tos because this is going to be insane to equip alts
wow,not_removed,lfr should never give higher ilvl then hc don lfr is so the newbs can se the raid not get tier amor ore high ilvl gear
wow,not_removed,pure guesstimation i tried my uh yesterday and seemed i was using cs very often like of gcds which would mean that you are looking at sec cd reduction every seconds you would get even more reduction during sr and bl with sephuz etc since haste through gcd is the limiting factor that would give us cd on aotd of something around minutes that seems decent also i am not sure but arent the ghouls from apoc also explodable by this
wow,not_removed,still on suicide watch
wow,not_removed,now i dont know how much the cd is gonna get reduced but the fact is that the bonus will do nothing on farm content and short fights edit now that i think about it the ghouls will be less likely to be able to apply the death debuff that gives us extra damage and they lose their own melee damage as well are we supposed to wait for their duration to almost run out without pressing death coil also what happens if you accidentally blow them up while they are away from the boss this set bonus makes no sense also you lose out on the portal to the underworld damage that the ghouls normally do when they reach the end of their duration so much damage trading going on this set bonus is just way too counter intuitive right now a good change would be to simply empower the ghouls with death coil so that they do the damage when they expire
wow,not_removed,i dont play dk but is that what gets reduced by cof for yall if so sounds pretty good
wow,not_removed,kind of unavoidable really otherwise youre just going to have the same problem every raid tier where people have got warforge gear from a higher difficulty which already outgears lower difficulty on the next tier so they roflstomp normal and heroic maybe get a few lucky upgrades and theyre already at an appropriate gear level for mythic before it even opens not such a huge issue as most of the mechanics arent the kinds of things you can outgears but it makes getting new drops which arent upgrades feel bad so setting the ilvl increment between tiers at more than you can reasonably expect the previous tier to titanforge at is the only sensible approach theyve​ painted themselves into a corner with the titanforging system and the only way to accommodate it now is with huge ilvl bumps between tiers
wow,not_removed,its more about letting players have someting to do most already outgear h tos and some already mythic tos before this ilvl bump reclearing would have been pointless
wow,not_removed,normal drops so it will probably be steamrolled by titanforged heroic gear
wow,not_removed,the fury piece looks good to me but getting will mean not using your bis legendaries
wow,not_removed,honestly i think the arms one is pretty cool bladestorm on a short cd and part of the single target rotation makes me happy
wow,not_removed,its alright you get increased ragegen with artifact traits anyway which means increased enrage uptime too
wow,not_removed,yeah a lot of people are up in arms about the shadow piece and for good reason current consensus is that well continue to farm nighthold for titanforged tier pieces since the tier four piece is sooooooo much better
wow,not_removed,yeah i wish shadowfiend was just removed honestly most boring ability in our kit
wow,not_removed,what why would u not want as disc
wow,not_removed,it looks like the pc bonus may be an attempt to help our ever growing mana problem
wow,not_removed,it really just pigeon holes us into taking talents only or not bothering with tier
wow,not_removed,fingrrs crossed the vers is placeholder also fucking guardian man which dev is playing them
wow,not_removed,beast master or brew master i actually really like the brewmaster depending on how often the procs it removes the brew gen of the but gives you a pseudo purifying plus large upfront heal the tier set will be amazingly better for corner tanking and will work with lower haste builds that use tiger palm less frequently
wow,not_removed,good news is the new tier will help bm be a lot more self sufficient at least it kinda sucks seeing all the other tanks do stuff without a healer where i just get to watch my health slowly go down until i die
wow,not_removed,as someone with legendary headchest i sincerely hope i dont have to choose between a and two legendaries two of the three good ones
wow,not_removed,i wonder if theyre planning to bring back the build at least im hoping so
wow,not_removed,a shame the fury nh bonus is trash
wow,not_removed,they wont nerf it until next expansion
wow,not_removed,were so juicy this patch with our reap uptime i dont even really mind it besides at least its not rng the seems really crap tho
wow,not_removed,visually or bonuses
wow,not_removed,its way better than it was garrote is now a sec cd get bonus dmg and generates two cp it looks like theyre moving toward esanguinate due to the removal of ap in honestly with the gutting of sin sub it could go anywhere from here
wow,not_removed,two piece is strong four piece is much weaker
wow,not_removed,it certainly synergises more with ed than the other legendaries it also doesnt particularly synergise with the new traits that basically encourage moonfire spam ed is currently the only boomie specificleggy i dont have guess i still have to grind for it
wow,not_removed,funny how that happens
wow,not_removed,esanguinate
wow,not_removed,absurd power creep has existed ever since they started doubling tripling and quadrupling up on difficulties you need at leas levels of gear per patch that alone causes a massive power creep over the base world the whole tf system just adds to it
wow,not_removed,i dont know who your math guys are but you pay them too much or maybe not enough
wow,not_removed,its more an issue of the intrinsic exponential scaling of ilvl and being so many xpacs in
wow,not_removed,yeah im willing to bet with high haste too that the best set will be nh with tos which sucks
wow,not_removed,simple answer probably not
wow,not_removed,im curious what else on that tier you find more interesting first blood adds blade dance to your rotation without it havoc is basically a single button spec and once in a while throw a glaive if you dont have fury for the gcd
wow,not_removed,yeah thats a weird set bonus i use vuhdo so i usually dont have friendly players targeted
wow,not_removed,i agree i use clique so i never target allies to heal in fact i usually have the boss targeted the whole fight for quick judges the would probably stack pretty well with the martyr cloak tho
wow,not_removed,nah its fine new tier comes out and your old gear is instantly obsolete anyway who gives a shit if the average player gets said obsolete level of gear like two full months later with the way they stagger lfr lfr plebs in heroic nh level gear are still going to be super far behind everyone else
wow,not_removed,lol ret rapes sorry you suck at it but they are far from worst
wow,not_removed,dont forget that lfr is severely timegated itll be weeks before lfr even becomes available by which time normalheroic raiders will already have several pieces of gear
wow,not_removed,all of the lfr heroes will at least have all off pieces a weapon and two legendaries if you strictly do lfr i doubt you will get to not without a lot of tfs but they should easily get to by the time tos comes out which is right on the money for lfr
wow,not_removed,everyone i see in pugs is these days even people without heroic guldan or any mythics its not terribly hard to do when you do your daily and weekly stuff titanforging and what not in mythic plus especially now with the ilvl buff will make it very easy to get to if you play every day even if you dont step foot into mythics
wow,not_removed,for the record the new tier set isnt bad numerically it generates a nice bit of rage it just feels extremely shitty
wow,not_removed,is insane but yes i agree
wow,not_removed,why does it matter
wow,not_removed,this is how its always been though current tier lfr is equal to last tier heroic worked like that with brf hfc lfr tot dropped higher item level than previous normal tier
wow,not_removed,no itd be like lfr tov being equal to heroic en or lfr nh equal to heroic tov
wow,not_removed,before evry body going to hate dislike my comment i will say more its seems like blizz trying to make evry one happy speciel those there dont have the time ore want to be social in the game and then reward them whit lfr gear first raid is raid they drop god gear for those there want to put in some effort for it dont have the time well fine you maybe have a job wife and kids agree high ind content take some time but dont blame it on blizz that you cant get better gear blame your self there are plenty of guild out there you can join and some times get in to an alt run whit them when the time is there for you dont like other people but why are you playing a game there are build on the concept of playing whit other people its not blizz mistake thats yours and only yours right now blizz rewarding peoble like and is that the right way to go no its not if peoble want better gear they have to put in some effort for it not just login do lfr and log out again
wow,not_removed,my philosophy is purely when asking for buffs expect an inch and ask for a mile
wow,not_removed,can confirm the ghouls from apocalypse would benefit from this as they also benefit from and
wow,not_removed,am already dead though
wow,not_removed,yeah but if i have chances are im so overgeared mobs would die if i glare their direction
wow,not_removed,never
wow,not_removed,i mean most top guilds were on mythic the second week its been their design all of legion so far
wow,not_removed,normal drops so it will probably be steamrolled by titanforged heroic gear anyway
wow,not_removed,im ok with the bump for higher difficulties but people who only do lfr shouldnt be getting base level gear imo
wow,not_removed,i heard youre only able to use set bonus at a time
wow,not_removed,good luck getting a tf of that gives you enough stats to offset not wearing nontier or tier i guess gear from tomb bosses
wow,not_removed,i cant wait to spin to win someone
wow,not_removed,it seems like a draught of souls to me mortal strikes on top of a bladestorm is going to be insane on a single target
wow,not_removed,thats not the point the fury piece is disgusting because you would have to drop inner rage else its pretty useless compared to the current tier set bonus and playing without inner rage having to spam button every time you enrage is not very fun edited the name since i messed the talents up
wow,not_removed,i suppose itll depend on the fight but with i can get atonements out in one rapture and one pwradiance before a burst the seems like it would be better for sustaining a medium amount of atonements well have to wait and see what tos brings in terms of damage patterns
wow,not_removed,a lot of the sets do that if you dont like playing breath of sindragosa for frost dk you may as well not get any tier pieces
wow,not_removed,the havoc bonuses are equally frustrating and force us to keep taking first blood edited for clarity
wow,not_removed,i hope so too i mean as i said the versatility is nice but is a real let down compared to the other bonuses also in answer every dev plays guardian explains why the other tanks are shafted so hard
wow,not_removed,beastmaster brewmaster is brm
wow,not_removed,i dont like what the means for the spec it will force us to chain bw because if we let it fall off the entire buff chain will just drop we are taking for granted the massive consistency that with the pack give without them we are completely at rngesus mercy it might even be worth dropping shoulders entirely and running and pieces with something like beltwrist legendariescof
wow,not_removed,aye luckily i just got sephuz las night and have been sitting on akainus for ages so no tier conflict for me
wow,not_removed,your chance of enraging gets twice as big how is that bad
wow,not_removed,you say that now but the trinket ilvl makes minimal difference so it will be just as strong in tos and later
wow,not_removed,bonus visually its just a reskin anyway
wow,not_removed,but surely shits all over the garrote buff from
wow,not_removed,sorry for the late response i think youre posing a fair question i am not of the mind that adding blade dance to the rotation really makes things that much more interesting my main contention with the set bonus is that it revolves around a talent that is as boring as the other two options on that tier i wouldve liked to see them focus on other aspects of the class maybe incentivize us to use different talent builds directly smooth out our resource generation in some way etc rather than essentially making blade dance function like a stronger and more resource efficient chaos strike thats just my personal preference though and in time i may find that i really enjoy the set bonus
wow,not_removed,that has nothing to do with his concern
wow,not_removed,most healers good ones anyway never target friendlies
wow,not_removed,going up about levels seems fine then its not like its gonna affect mythic or even heroic raiders
wow,not_removed,i dont like your tone bout lfr take it back s
wow,not_removed,i think we got it
wow,not_removed,wanna say that again
wow,not_removed,for the record the new tier set isnt bad numerically it generates a nice bit of rage it just feels extremely shitty for the record the new tier set isnt bad numerically it generates a nice bit of rage it just feels extremely shitty
wow,not_removed,im actually triggered by this what the hell did you do
wow,not_removed,yes for some fights its fantastic however does nothing for us on fights like krosusaugur thats honestly my only complaint this tier is being dicked by long periods of magic damage
wow,not_removed,people that do significantly more difficult content should be rewarded significantly more i guarantee tos lfr will be a joke compared to heroic nh with the same gear on you
wow,not_removed,tov is a boss filler raid
wow,not_removed,suffer well
wow,not_removed,when i mean farm content i mean easierold bosses that you already killed
wow,not_removed,its not an issue of speed of progression as much as it is the feeling of getting crap loot from new content going into a new raid tier and getting drops from progression content which are at best a marginal upgrade just feels bad and a lot of people wont even be able to equip new stuff until they get four pieces because they cant manage to juggle their existing legendaries and tier slots without breaking their existing which is even more unfun
wow,not_removed,yes but if mythic tos stayed they would outgear it on day some players are right now before legendary bump i would not be surprised if guilds which are splitfarming mythic ended pretty close to when tos opens
wow,not_removed,you would have to drop fronthing berserker huh why and playing without fronthing berserker having to spam button every time you enrage is not very fun youre mixing up frothing with inner rage right inner rage is just getting stronger with just so you know rbs with it are worth as much as rbs without it and there is no way you can fit rbs into window with frenzy which is somewhat competetive compared to bloodbath
wow,not_removed,is quite strong especially on specific fights but is more generally strong and synergizes with the unlike smite belt you cant loose time on the proc is more penance damage is extra penance per minute which is bonus penance damage excluding potds procs together with you get more damage to penance on most bosses penance is of your total healing making a hps buff its huge effect on its own is more healing of course blizzard has suggested they want to change disc somehow which could make all this theory crafting moot
wow,not_removed,but first blood is the best talent on that row anyways
wow,not_removed,its not only that one of our new artifact traits increases the critical strike damage of blade dance by the new playstyle is fun and all but i miss the old momentumbloodlet build and cant see any reason to ever do it just for funsies anymore i really dislike being forced into a certain spec i get that there will always be a spec that is cemented as but the fact that theyre forcing us into this is really frustrating
wow,not_removed,good point
wow,not_removed,the first iteration of was way worse has better bonuses thats for sure but ilvl should make up for it
wow,not_removed,i think we got it
wow,not_removed,sorry mobile apparently bugged out ill go and delete a few
wow,not_removed,the trinkets look awesome this time tho
wow,not_removed,i typically agree outside of major tier changes from entovnh lfr should never surpass heroic nh and that was done with a new tier comes catchup mechanics all over the place is by all technical means the new prepaid baseline so lfr needs to beat the new baseline
wow,not_removed,but people who did the difficult content before the next tier come out have the cutting edge and aotc achievements thats the main different between all the skills i dont care where the ilvl of lfr is compared to previous tiers its job is to act as a decent catch up mechanic to get into the current content its way better than having to progress through nighthold when tomb is out because thats the only place to get gear high enough to make tos possible
wow,not_removed,what im fairly sure its to make you use tos items instead of titanforged nh items no matter what
wow,not_removed,they want people to use the current tier of gear world quests are comparatively much easier than heroic en yet they now reward the same ilevel gear same with normalheroic nighthold being easier than mythic en i think the change is good it means that tos gear will be an upgrade for people over titanforged nighthold items items
wow,not_removed,for being such a toxic and selfish community that wow is most people are surprisingly considerate about whatever gear other players has why does it matter to you if some lfr hero got a titanforged draught of souls hes not in your guild most likely not killing your bosses he is way under your itemlevel so what really is the problem here you do get better gear than he does youre probably way more skilled than he is hes taking the scenery route and you get the adrenaline action of killing mythic bosses and can brag about it i really fail to see the problem its just that special snowflake syndrome that i should be best and have the best toys because i put in most effort into it and yes yes you should and you are i dont get this fucking subreddit sometimes
wow,not_removed,nh heroic is a joke for me right now so why would i care
wow,not_removed,lfr is gearing for normal of the current tier not the old raids
wow,not_removed,its still the previous raid and the appropriate one to compare to
wow,not_removed,it still has relics and a full set of gear in drops
wow,not_removed,yeah i messed up the names my bad but even so you wont really stack it up high enough with only rbs compared to the you can use during enrage and there would be quite the difference from only more bt damage compared to in my opinion taking piece just for more damage on bt is not worth considering the nh piece allows you to stay enraged almost permanently
wow,not_removed,im not disagreeing with that i was just hoping that wed get a set bonus that would give us another option on that tier thats just my personal preference though
wow,not_removed,exactly and the fact that there are two legendaries for fel rush and bloodlet that were obviously meant for the momentum build its just sad
wow,not_removed,i like that one from the first boss the str w the or so armor proc
wow,not_removed,if the last tier is still higher than next lfr then you have greater incentives to play the expansion instead of just the patch and progress tos on difficulties titanforging still exists though and does alliviate this a bit
wow,not_removed,meh so at least settle on
wow,not_removed,world quests are base level tops heroic nh is
wow,not_removed,people keep missing the point none care about lfr dropping what we care is the slow character progression on high end raiding we are on mythic and in order to get upgrades we are running mythic entov and heroic nh every week just to increase the chances of tf items while the loot from the latest bosses we killed goes to shards if its not warforged bosses are tuned around the ilvl they normally drop and you barely see improvements on your character from week to week every boss on mythic is a gear check and you dont have a way to improve your gear
wow,not_removed,this isnt about titanforging i dont like that either but whatever let them have occasionally boosted items this is about a ridiculous base level for lfr i dont raid mythic btw and think mythic nh gear should be boosted at least levels considering how hard it is
wow,not_removed,i agree i am a heroicmythic progression raider and i honestly do not care about people getting easy gear the gear for me isnt necessarily a reward its the experience that comes with beating a boss especially on progression if gear comes with it it feels extra great but people get too up in arms over lfr content
wow,not_removed,its reward for effort what do you say to someone in your countty having a similar job but doing almost nothing and shorter hoursand getting a higher salary
wow,not_removed,taaaaaaawwxick
wow,not_removed,because i dont want to clear that shit to stay competetive and if you dont get this subreddit please leave best for the both parties
wow,not_removed,its because of the special snowflake factor
wow,not_removed,lol what tov is insignificant and if the gear you get form the broken shore is why would you make lfr it would make it not even worth it for casual players its also time gated so its not like everyone will be doing lfr to get into first week heroics its also a tier change which means there will be caught up mechanics so that way more people can experience the content
wow,not_removed,as i said rb with inner rage is worth rbs without the only other talent in this row you can take is frenzy but frenzy wont allow you to cast rbs in window since you will have to refresh enrage by rampaging and refresh frenzy by wild slashing so ir is still miles ahead sometimes you can even fit ir rbs into window and thats just nuts is bad yes
wow,not_removed,yeah that one is sick like armor im just happy overall the tank trinkets in nh sucked especially for a prot warrior and im just happy theres fun procs
wow,not_removed,whats the difference its not going to affect anything relevant
wow,not_removed,right i said en not nh my point is that they dont really have an issue making older tiers of content irrelevant in order to push people into newer stuff
wow,not_removed,as somebody that is for the most part guildless and pugs every thing fuck off let people get gear you want those people that need lfr to end up in your pugs underskilled and undergeared hell they need it more than the rest of us get the stick out of your ass and your head out of the sand having those that cant get that extra damage out through smart play and rotation get gear to supplement that fact is a good thing for us
wow,not_removed,and you are free to accept the same job if you want that line needed to be added for you comparison to be true
wow,not_removed,yeah our rewards may be similar in the gear department remember lfr base is significantly lower than mythic but youre also progression raiding which means youre pushing for the achievement if we got exactly the same rewards nobody would be doing mythic youre in it for the world firsts and the aotc not to mention the ability to pull your mythic epeen out to prove how good you are when applying for m groups
wow,not_removed,tov isnt insignificant and it wouldnt matter if it was broken shore shouldnt be anyways so that doesnt help the argument im all for catchup mechanics but not catchup mechanics that ignore what should be still relevant content
wow,not_removed,yeah but think about it en heroic only now became irrelevant due to world quests and nh lfr perhaps too but now this makes nh heroic irrelevant totally skipping tov tiers i guess it could be a while before lfr is out after normal is but who knows
wow,not_removed,this is what people who dont do mythic raiding say people want a reward both in terms of achievement and in terms of gear if mythic dropped the same gear as heroic even less people would do it
wow,not_removed,the thing is with the stupid titanforged system i dont need to do mythic to get better gear than mythic its all rng based it isnt fun nor rewarding
wow,not_removed,thats my entire point its already scaled the way you say mythic is better than heroic is better than norm is better than lfr just because i get a tf lfr piece and you get an mythic piece doesnt mean im magically better than you somehow it means i had good rng your reward is a better shot at higher tier gear pieces and achievement lfr is just rng for scaling gear and no achievement why are you even trying to compare the two to begin with
wow,not_removed,its not scaled enough so no youre missing the point the mere fact you can get lfr gear comparable to heroicmythic is a joke in itself and shouldnt occur mythic nighthold is insanely difficult and not rewarding enough and lfr queens who say that its all about the achievement dont actually have the perspective of worn out mythic raiders who have less and less reasons to torment on mythic when they can easily clear heroic and hope for nice forges
wow,not_removed,so they why bitch about it and just scale back to heroic if nobody clears mythic wont that send a better message than putting someone down because they cant play as much as you should i not also get to feel powerful and have gear acceptable enough from lfr to run mythic why the war on the lfr groups who are just casual and obviously not gaining anything other than slowly enjoying the content at their pace why is it the elitist that always stomp on the little guys for getting decent rewards for the time they put in my time is just as important than yours i just dont have days to spend wiping times on a single boss why should i be rewarded any differently if the boss is unkillable thats a balance issue not s fearing problem otherwise take your ass to heroicnormallfr and gear to then go walk into mythic
wow,not_removed,my point is if thats clearly the best way to gear why not do that why not abuse the system while you can until it gets nerfed you dont see whole guilds spamming lfr on repeat to gear its a non issue and clearly blizzard agrees
wow,not_removed,imagine each of those fellas later coming to rwow to complain and make stupid joke groups like need ilvl for deadmines normal w guldan mythic
wow,not_removed,yea i got a maw key too ran like guildies through it for the weekly chest whenever i had to pug a spot the queue would instantly fill with people
wow,not_removed,can we save that so an autobot is posting it each time someones complains about i got declined d
wow,not_removed,fellas could some one list me of the most wanted hated mythic dungeons cant find it anywhere
wow,not_removed,just sell it you can get upwards for it
wow,not_removed,why dont pick all wait
wow,not_removed,hey im in this im the mage at the top their fatherthomas
wow,not_removed,hard to see but did you set the limit to well yeah is the new p
wow,not_removed,what addon do you use for the whispers
wow,not_removed,im honestly surprised that depleted keys count towards the weekly chest not that i dislike everyone getting free gear with a little bit of a time investment but it does seem like a high reward for such little effort considering the same level gear would require a m helya or guldan kill
wow,not_removed,not even joking i remember this grp i was one of the people that posted lmao
wow,not_removed,pretty much any thats not brh or hov right now everyone wants that weekly
wow,not_removed,i had the same problem vv
wow,not_removed,sort by ilvl and then take the lowest
wow,not_removed,as a player doing of his time mythic i am really sad how item inflation is killing all the challenge every noob can now do and get the achievement and loot chest
wow,not_removed,meanwhile we are clearing hov and brh just for items 😃
wow,not_removed,how would you just run a failed timer run each timev
wow,not_removed,hi jurble i was one of those people and i greatly appreciate you running me through anubis and rampunch though i dont appreciate them
wow,not_removed,that is amazing yeah i wasnt so lucky i got a dht with teeming skittish and fortified guildies and i decided to pug a depleted run and we were able to beat it with a death counter
wow,not_removed,they added a new message that says this group is no longer searching for players so it doesnt look like you are getting declined by every group now
wow,not_removed,most wanted mos most hated hov everything else is in the middle
wow,not_removed,moscosdhtntleoaarcwayvotwbrhhov from my experience
wow,not_removed,maw is by far the most wanted darkheart nelths lair and court of stars are the other preferred dungeons arcway is either loved or hated depending on persongroup nobody really actively looks for brh or vault but they arent really hated by most people either in my experience eoa is very difficult to find people for especially once it gets the affix to it hov is generally hated
wow,not_removed,fuck brh with a hot tire iron
wow,not_removed,mos is the most wanted short straightforward easily multichestable cosdht are also high in the list because they are short but somehow harder than mos arcway is long but not hard to multichest and has nice loots chronoshard pieces from the dungeon set so youll always find people who want to run it nl strongly depends on affixes wow eoa have some people looking for them brh and hov are the most hated hov is not that hard imo but its a run
wow,not_removed,wim
wow,not_removed,its not free gear when its just as likely youll get a mediocre sidegrade or even a high ilvl downgrade an item with the same slot as a legendary and it can only happen once a week
wow,not_removed,you know better while its something id do to one of the guys maybe i wouldnt grab all the lowest in fact id probably grab a bunch of plate wearers so i can get their loot if they dont need
wow,not_removed,am noob cant do
wow,not_removed,weird that would be like asking for rando boss mythic ach instead of cutting edge
wow,not_removed,yep weekly chest is based on an individuals highest completed not your highest timed so you can run a failed keystone repeatedly to get people the weekly chest
wow,not_removed,because when its depleted and you complete it anyway no timer anymore you get a high ilvl gear from your highest completed key in this case would be something like with probability of being forged and since maw of souls its the easiest one everyone wants it for the weekly loot
wow,not_removed,y tank u mr snag
wow,not_removed,you are getting declined theyre just doing it indirectly if they wanted you they wouldnt have taken the other guy
wow,not_removed,dhtcos are towards the maw end of that spectrum vowarcway are towards the hov end edit half of the replies agree with me the other half disagree wow thats so weird
wow,not_removed,hov is a lot easier than a lot of people think its just the margin for error is pretty small and the time sink if there are many errors is too great of a risk arcway is the same way but with less of a compact space here you can royally fuck up so it is easier
wow,not_removed,and ironically the easiest dungeons eoa with fortified nl with tyrannical except teeming arent that wanted at allalways easy to get into groups for them
wow,not_removed,may i ask why mos is the most wanted is it because its short or because of the quality of the loot
wow,not_removed,i actually prefer other keys besides mos for the times for chest in maw are incredible hard to achieve for lower keys maw is easy and possibly the best mythic to farm ap
wow,not_removed,brh did and its so insane
wow,not_removed,ive noticed that dungeons that are easy in the start are the most desirable in the end hov is pretty hated since the beginning but we did it at in time this week mos was like the hardest dungeon on release and is a cakewalk now nl was a wipefest in the start but now one of the easier keys to do at a high level
wow,not_removed,im at traits and i will take all your hov and arcway keys the timers are super easy drop my bis relics plus some other good shit and people overrate the difficulty when everything is so overheated anyway
wow,not_removed,thank you for the quick response why hov is hated so much vs others
wow,not_removed,its kinda funny i was on the hov hatetrain for a while too but while we were pushing for this week bolstering overflowing tyrannical we just happened to end up with so we decided to hell with it were gonna run it anyways turns out we completed it in time for all of our first achis with a magnificent seconds to spare we basically went in halfblind never done a keystone even close as high there before our tank hadnt even run it before on m he got from the run as well lmao i gotta admit theres a little bit of luck involved with hyrja on tyrannical and im not sure if id ever run it on fortified but honestly i actually kinda enjoyed the experience will definitely be more inclined to run hov in the future
wow,not_removed,dhtnlcos are also good ones
wow,not_removed,eoa may be the easiest to complete on high level keys though in my opinion the only thing that really hurts is the double giant pack before the boss and the last boss on tyrannical the rest is pretty manageable if your group does well
wow,not_removed,mos depleted per spot must be x server and ilvl difference in looking for a boost its a you cant really be boosted through those without a lot of blood sweat tears and lack of loot finding geared people with money that were too lazy to get their done for the week isnt as rare as youd think
wow,not_removed,what is a boost i dont actually know the terminology
wow,not_removed,right similar to a raid prior to nh release there was nothing in the game that would give you a base ilvl item the only place that offers a base ilvl item is mythic nh not many guilds have cleared any of that yet item level is extremely high for the vast majority of players right now
wow,not_removed,i was saying to take them for the luls get your pick of ilvl and then ignore all the p
wow,not_removed,then you dont have high ilvl or are doing sth really wrong
wow,not_removed,never though of that before if i get a maw i know what im doing
wow,not_removed,so you are doing the dungeon and wait for the timer to run out before finishing the final boss
wow,not_removed,just wait until raging necrotic fortified week and none will touch maw d only week that dungeon is hard
wow,not_removed,the loot doesnt come from the completed key the loot pool is shared across all dungeons i believe
wow,not_removed,in case youre talking about the weekly chest completing a translates to a ilvl piece from it already got one last week was so lucky to get a freaking artifact relic d
wow,not_removed,now lets get to some mythic nighthold already
wow,not_removed,not always sometimes people join as the last person is invited
wow,not_removed,when did we start talking about my dating life
wow,not_removed,i would say brh is also towards the hov end too especially on weeks with teeming or raging as affixes
wow,not_removed,arcway is only hated when its fortify week in my experience ran a with tyrannical the other week super easy chest with a couple wipes on the spider boss
wow,not_removed,but i love arcway and my private haste damage buff pet
wow,not_removed,vault isnt bad at all most weeks the rest is pretty accurate
wow,not_removed,arcway is totaly fine bro
wow,not_removed,if i see vault on any week im excited it is so easy to chest vault the only difficult part of the instance is the beginning and you can invis pot through a large portion of it
wow,not_removed,unless you have a tyrannical or higher cos
wow,not_removed,as someone who runs almost exclusively arc as its the only place left with a correctly statted upgrade fuck arc
wow,not_removed,arcway isnt that bad it has a lot of leeway on timer too
wow,not_removed,beeing the gigant right whats the backroad
wow,not_removed,hold on now what is this back road that you speak of sir
wow,not_removed,people like eoa its my most hated dungeon of all time or well second most hated the first being violet hold but thats not a mythic dungeon soo
wow,not_removed,i dont think hov is all that hard its just long with like you said low margin of error all for similar rewards as quicker higher margin dungeons
wow,not_removed,hov suffers from dhtnelth syndrome but on a much higher level and that is that there are no checkpoints you spawn at the start of the instance no matter where you die so runbacks are massive if you mess up and its never efficient to respawn after a random death
wow,not_removed,arcway also has an extremely forgiving timer you can wipe several times and still beat the timer on higher keys
wow,not_removed,vault is pretty easy for both affixes imo if your group doesnt panic on the boss
wow,not_removed,pugged my keymaster on tyrannical took one try with around to go last boss is a total joke the only parts where you need to pay attention is and third boss as well as the scorpions even if not fortified those things hit like trucks already on tyrannical but are even more of a nightmare on fortified where they hand your ass over to you if you do one mistake
wow,not_removed,shortest
wow,not_removed,short and for all the people trying to get to traits itll never go down in popularity either because the amount to get traits in all your specs and alts would take longer than this xpac i think unless they change how it works
wow,not_removed,well to be fair he didnt ask which one a few people prefer at a given level he asked most wantedhated since ap farm will be the most common thing this expansion until they change something about it mos is the most wanted
wow,not_removed,brh teeming skittish fortified is glorious
wow,not_removed,yeah my guildies recommend hov as the best to complete with the timer
wow,not_removed,at that point youre looking at gear again it still doesnt change that most the ap farmers would rather mos im sure thats what you were spamming to traits and since they make up a vast majority it still makes it the most wanted
wow,not_removed,its longer for basically the same rewards
wow,not_removed,long relies on damage dealers using interrupts hard in both tyrannical bosses are harder than average and fortified large and quite strong packs but horn of valor drops
wow,not_removed,personally i have no problem with hov other than its length its not a bad dungeon and if youre looking for gear its okay but if youre running m like most nowadays youre doing it for ap not gear thus length matters
wow,not_removed,theyre good on non teeming weeks teeming nelth and cos are a pita
wow,not_removed,is really cheap we have no problems finding buyers for around eu
wow,not_removed,i take it you post this in the group finder
wow,not_removed,okay this is a bit fucked surely blizzard arent going to let this continue for too long mos farming was already getting ridiculous
wow,not_removed,boosting a isnt that difficult if the guy receiving the boost does okish dmg dps overall you can even chest it especially if it is mos even if he goes afk you can man it in time easily
wow,not_removed,people in the group grab a undergeared rando and carry him through a high level key so he gets gear
wow,not_removed,the vast majority of players arent clearing this week or any week in the future
wow,not_removed,i mean id probably bring like a healer or tank if available with that i wouldnt really have to care about everyone elses ilvl
wow,not_removed,or maybe your perception is massively out of whack
wow,not_removed,probably because they have a of the easiest dungeon lets say each dungeon is a board game would you rather play a game of chess or a game of candy land if the prize on the line is the exact same value the answer is you take the path of least resistance its not like they cant also run the other stuff this is just an easy way to get that class hall chest
wow,not_removed,most of my guild is casual they dont play enough to push a key to i push a bunch of keys to and higher this week personally but it was generally with a smaller group of players players in my guild
wow,not_removed,next week
wow,not_removed,ill take it over votw or arcway nothing like a raging prophecy of doom to ruin your day
wow,not_removed,yeah ive had people apply that i would have preferred over the person i just invited but it doesnt delist the group until they actually accept and canceling the invite would be kinda shitty
wow,not_removed,teeming yes raging not really i find brh shitty on volcanic weeks really lots of tiny spaces also invis pots really trivialize brh use it to run to first boss then use it to skip bat gauntlet
wow,not_removed,brh is shit on sanguine too especially without a dkdruid all the archers and the fire breathing dudes rolling stones down the stairs stand in the pools and need to be displaced or focus dpsed to compensate for the healing
wow,not_removed,strange brh is one of those long dungeons which nobody likes that much but i put it close to one of the best at high levels as there isnt any mobboss except for last on tyranical that is annoying
wow,not_removed,and hate for arcway increases if you have to go right
wow,not_removed,what mob gives you that
wow,not_removed,yeh but so many people just cant get the mechanics on the last boss
wow,not_removed,vault is my most hated dungeon and i love to go hov vault just makes my eyes and ears bleed with all the bullshit cordana and that demon hunter are throwing at me while you delete their miserable existance from this timeline
wow,not_removed,yeah votw is very doable also this week in eu arcway is definitely doable with decent playes i finally got my overall ilvl to and keystone conquerer and got invited as healer im shammy and we chested it easily
wow,not_removed,vault would be ezpz if it didnt have the most annoying dungeon boss in the game inquisitor
wow,not_removed,do you play on na arcway is great edit downvote because of this jeez ive never seen anyone from my realm dislike arcway atleast not have it up to hov
wow,not_removed,cos can be awful with the right affixes i did a teemingskittishfortified some weeks ago and ill never do that again everything is fine until you get to the actual court area the double inquisitor packs will make your life hell
wow,not_removed,i think hes referring to having a dh jump up the cliff next to the cave and having everyone use swapblaster type effects to get up there this way you skip the cave
wow,not_removed,instead of killing mobs inside the tunnel which takes a rather long time since you need to be unmounted the idea is that you kill a bunch of crabs in order to increase your kill count check this video for a pretty decent explanation however you dont need to be an engineer to accomplish this iirc you can sit on the back of a druid who jumps rogues can shadowstep dhs double jump and priests who get over can use lifegrip to pull people up perhaps not very easy to accomplish in a pug but if you have a group of guildesfriends who you usually do ms with you should go and practice as it easily shaves a minute or two from the timer
wow,not_removed,eoa is my favorite i tank in dungeons and it feels very open and not super linear bosses are also rather simple and there isnt too much trash
wow,not_removed,imo its the easiest dungeon to get multiple chests on fortified the timer is long and theres only three even vaguely difficult trash pulls the two arcanists and the double giants pull whole different story on tyrannical
wow,not_removed,my major problem with hov is the unskippable stupidass roleplay dialogues
wow,not_removed,did a votw this week boss was easier than i thought
wow,not_removed,nl is a healers worst nightmare damage is so high and unavoidable mostly ive healed a and i never want to do it again id imagine fortified scorpions are terrors
wow,not_removed,oh okay is the case the same for cos and dht i see boosting groups often offering boosts for all of those
wow,not_removed,if you have dps with over hp high artifact level so they dont get one shot and have a healer that can almost instantly top them up we did it with druid so take that one with a grain of salt then it should be no issue we had dps die in the first of odyn and finished it with minutes to spare so now problem there
wow,not_removed,mos is my or dungeon i think i have a lot of arcways and cos probably like times more than maw and a few dhtnl runs efficiency is overrated i can do more farming if i actually enjoy it and dont get burnt out by doing dungeons i hate
wow,not_removed,also has trash with unavoidable damage crammed spaces and the second boss left one is particularly hard with tyrannical both tyrannical and fortified suck for the instance
wow,not_removed,i think its mainly the trash with unavoidable damage instead of the length
wow,not_removed,aye thats fair i mostly run m just for the weekly chest so efficiency is much less of a concern to me personally but of course those grinding hardcore towards will have very different priorities
wow,not_removed,more and more people will be hitting that trait cap soon im nearly there away from it or later at that point ap will become irrelevant till and since now you can loot gear every dungeon has become interesting to run again for gear i feel like in a couple of weeks we might see more completion of the odddisliked dungeons
wow,not_removed,teeming hov shudder
wow,not_removed,so an easy € a bit more than gold per token some people seem to have a lot of gold on their characters
wow,not_removed,blizzard doesnt care what you do for gold they only care when you charge actual real world currency and even then they only pretend to care
wow,not_removed,what stands out to me is that in when there was an overpowered route for farming paragon levels blizz would usually nerf it to get it in line with other common farm routesthis was prerifts i am surprised that mos hasnt been changed yet also hov but for the opposite reason
wow,not_removed,yea idd sold quite few this week bolstering overflowing tyrannical had to wait around or go mass die because we would always get two chest running same depleted key many times almost got chest on eoa when one we boosted actually had some dps
wow,not_removed,or so they get ap
wow,not_removed,or maybe all are hurt here and downvotejust speaking the truth game is more and more casual
wow,not_removed,but if you are able to finish it in time while depleted the key is upgradeable again and you can move on to or whatever if you fulfill the time req on the next run
wow,not_removed,yes i know but so you can run a failed keystone repeatedly to and ran like guildies through it for the weekly chest this implies you run the same key more than once since it gets upgraded if you make it in time you cant run the same key again after so again do you do the dungeon normally and wait for the timer to run out before finishing the final boss to keep your maw key
wow,not_removed,he just said that maw is one of the easiest dungeons also shortest
wow,not_removed,then use it to skip bat gauntlet you cant do that if you already skipped the trash up until the first boss youd be lacking killcount if you skipped the bat gauntlet too
wow,not_removed,you generally just go on to pull the next group when the wyrmtongue dudes are standing in the puddle the archers are more of an issue since they actually do damage but also are more preventable just dont tank mobs on top of them
wow,not_removed,the crescent hallway if you dont have aoe stuns is pretty bad
wow,not_removed,thats why you take a druid with you and with guardians and resto being rather common this patch that isnt a tough requirement then you can do a reverse skip of that bridge area just before the boss or would be if you have to go right you go down the ramp right after spider boss the druid starts stealthing all the way around to the boss where you normally can jump down after killing him once he is clear the rest of the group pulls some trash and just dies nearby for a rez the druid either does a mass rez if resto or rezzes the healer so they can mass rez note though you should only do this if you are reasonably confident that you can kill the one trash pack in front of the boss which is one of the more annoying ones mind you and the boss itself without a wipe but if you can this saves you minutes
wow,not_removed,eredar casters before felguard boss the other i had mine randomly disappear after i dismissed it and enslave it again feelsbadman
wow,not_removed,the eredar chaosbringer
wow,not_removed,yeah i dont see why everyone has such a hard time with that you can see when she casts the spell where the space is dont even need the light
wow,not_removed,play with people higher than ilvl
wow,not_removed,cos yesterday those inquisitor eyes are awful any pull then the imps frequently turn as one and one shot a party member i think this is a skittish problem because it definitely happened to me last time we had skittish as well
wow,not_removed,they fixed this apparently when we tried to do it a few days ago our warrior was getting no path available
wow,not_removed,i see we usually do m with guildies so i ll have a look and explain thanks man
wow,not_removed,yeah i tank usually too but i hated eoa even more when i rerolled a healer god that third boss mayhem randoms cant seem to understand that the red and blue worms needs to die
wow,not_removed,i never do though
wow,not_removed,im with you here the entire top platform shouldnt be a thing imo you go up there and should fight odyn for those of us that have run something myth holy fuck do i care about your rp
wow,not_removed,maybe i didnt formulate this correctly but i wanted to say that even though its tyrannical and theyre not fortified they already hit like a truck even on tyrannical these scorpions are no joke
wow,not_removed,remember avalanches can be completely negated if you move while he is casting since the place where you are at the start of the cast determines where the rocks will fall down its just that people like to ignore mechanics and not move causing you to see people losing of their health at once even funnier if those brilliant minds stack on top of each others and get one shot
wow,not_removed,i mean those groups are popular too just saying mos will be the top depending on affixes and potential gear they might be looking for or even team setup those might be easier for them at that moment
wow,not_removed,its your or it doesnt change that most wanted overall is mos
wow,not_removed,i dont do very many mythic and i dont care much for the speed run aspect so the highest ive done is a few times whats tyrannical do
wow,not_removed,that as well but length is a big deal for grinders
wow,not_removed,while i agree that there might be a rise i still think mos will be most wanted thing is youll always have alts and youll always have specs to get ap for ap farming might decline slightly but itll still be a mos spamfest
wow,not_removed,some have easily millions cuz of all that wod garrison bullshittery someone offered us million gold for a intime followed up by a not in time crazy stuff
wow,not_removed,teemingskittishfortified for us and we were chestng eoa no problem
wow,not_removed,people that are boosting since expansion start dont care about ap anymore all of us are at for a couple of weeks and mid to maybe even for some more hardcore folks in second weapon boosting now is either for gold items or for alts
wow,not_removed,the reason why they are intentionally depleting it is because hes doing it to get guildies their loot not to push the key if the key gets pushed theres a high likelihood of it being a much more painful dungeon which kills the key
wow,not_removed,you absolutely can infact i did it just after i had finished posting that
wow,not_removed,did you test this you can pull other mobs
wow,not_removed,our warlock had trouble getting the mob to cast the spell on him it seemed to randomly target itselfthe group do you have a workaround
wow,not_removed,rng can fuck you hard tho
wow,not_removed,yes because ilv skill
wow,not_removed,if you look at the video the warrior is jumping while using heroic leap idk maybe thats whats different
wow,not_removed,you probably know this but you can kill the worm boss and as a result will not have to clear seagulls there makes it easier to do than all the fire mageshunters being chased by birds around
wow,not_removed,i love eoa on my tank but hate it on my healer depending on your roll it can be fun and easy or a painful nightmare
wow,not_removed,this week i did and started a nelth before the tank quit on the group peltersscorpionsshard thrower dudes as a mage if theres not enough stuns or we dont burn them fast and they look at me the wrong way i die iceblock can only save me once on a min cd and the fire shieldice barrierprismatic shield wont do shit against one of them
wow,not_removed,tyrannical is a and up affix that gives bosses extra health and deal extra damage fortified is the other possibility for which is the same but for trash
wow,not_removed,i do them but i think they would be much more enjoyable if you got the loot as long as you finished on time reguardless if there was second or min left the loot would be the same
wow,not_removed,it increases boss health and damage dealt by bosses which is easy in some instances but hard in others thats why otherwise easy dungeons like cosdht become much harder on or higher because the final bosses of those dungeons have some mechanics that deal high damage cos is basically a dpsrace and at i think you need like dps to down the boss before his slicing maelstrom or whatever its called just flat out kills your group
wow,not_removed,oh definitely mos will stay king i was merely suggesting that queuing your higer hov key might now actually result in a run instead of waiting for and see maybe one person apply even though youre a healer
wow,not_removed,what server are u on
wow,not_removed,jesus how do you even do that shit with those affixes i can imagine doing a good chest with nice affixes but chest with teemingskittish unbelievable
wow,not_removed,eoa is the easiest fortified dungeon p
wow,not_removed,but if he upgraded to a he wouldnt keep rushing guildies and pugs to do it
wow,not_removed,turm off autocast and manually cast it on yourself
wow,not_removed,not really you can always make it in that instance and you can always see where the empty spot is without the light just gotta watch when she casts it once its moving you cant see without the light anymore
wow,not_removed,most of the time yes players with higher ilvl are more likely to have played more and done the dungeon more thats not to say you cant meet fucking idiots even in
wow,not_removed,yeah i already knew but thanks anyway
wow,not_removed,typically people hate fortified more than tyrannical id guess eh
wow,not_removed,doesnt even have to be second you just dont get the keystone if youre late still get the chest and the weekly chest if its your best
wow,not_removed,gotcha and yeah i can understand that with cos
wow,not_removed,server doesnt really matter we take buyers from whole of eu anyways
wow,not_removed,none of these are slowing the groups progression teeming is more mobs but youll ae everything down anyway so it doesnt change much in the time per pack you spend skittish is about tank holding aggro dps using stuns again it doesnt slow the group compare this to necrotic tank has to kite tank deals no damage dps damage is reduced if they are affected by target movement tank has to destack or bolstering no masspull youll see these affixes are very favorable
wow,not_removed,depends on the group setup having ranged dps helps and so does misdirection tricks of the trade threat dumps not going full ham second after the pull but waiting a little bit for tank to establish threat people actually using their utility to survive stuns disorients disengages etc pala tank or bm ww with ox statue etc plenty of ways to avoid the worst effects of skittish after that its really just up to how fast you kill stuff high ilevel makes everything easier bossfights will be a cakewalk so its just up to how well you manage the trash in between
wow,not_removed,basically what usundaeservice said our comp was guardian druid resto druid fdk ww monk spriest our tank had the increased thrash damage bracers so as a monk i let him thrash twice before using any hard hitting abilities if anyone picks up aggro you immediately stun or pop a defensive cd you then have two options kite and wait for tank to pick it up switch to another mob you probably have less threat on and let tank pick up the one on you people mistake skittish for meaning my deeps is too big so i die and its not that at all you have to let the tank establish a threat level before you use big dps cooldowns i pick up aggro on almost every mob instantly if i open with my aoe abilites in terms of damage everyone is equipped so damage isnt an issue
wow,not_removed,brewmasters have aoe taunt
wow,not_removed,the hardest part in eoa with those affixes is the last boss who isnt even tyrannical by far the best dungeon to do on fortified weeks imo
wow,not_removed,not pointless as of recently ive learned you can only get like item level once a week not sure if thats correct so running or minute maw would be a lot quicker than pushing a bunch of loot for progression is huge so every raider should have been doing it since start of expansion
wow,not_removed,if she puts in a row right near the edges rng definitely fucks you over
wow,not_removed,most of the time you spend in m is on trash and bosses are pretty much a joke to tank without tyrannical while you can always get more trash if you can handle it to make the run quicker tyrannical is easier in my opinion except for some bosses that really suck the best example is the flying angel boss in hov the one on the left she hurts like fuck with tyrannical
wow,not_removed,it depends on the dungeon some bosses are incredibly hard on tyrannical
wow,not_removed,exactly they could have came up with a million different ideas than having a keystone that essentially nobody wants to run with unless they are guildies or desperate for a last minute mythic
wow,not_removed,are you intentionally misunderstanding him or something they are failing the timer intentionally the statement you said was false a few comments up to keep the stone depleted so they can rerun the dungeon over and over again if they dont the key will eventually be upgraded
wow,not_removed,made over the weekend doing maw
wow,not_removed,thats why you dont immediately walk through the first hole you can hang out near the middle of the platform and wait for the gap to come to you
wow,not_removed,volcanic tyranical is also very anoying since bosses tend to get very long
wow,not_removed,short overview of what i see as problematic bosses on tyrannical votw boss is a pain on tyrannical and on higher keys will almost one shot you if you dont move out of the laser beam he shoots preemptively for cordana if one of the melees forgets about the orb coming back youre in for a world of pain and usually a wipe cos last boss only but he has to be one of the hardest of them all soft enrage so you need a good chunk of dps to kill him before it becomes unhealable were talking is possible echoes depending on the level of your key dht two bullshit abilities the grip from oakheart hits insanely hard and the shadowbolt volley from xavius too instakill before it got nerfed in if not mitigated properly by everyone arcway nothing stands out general is the hardest boss though need lust on that mos first boss using dark slash is instakill if not mitigatedtank is not topped off beforehand helyas brine swipe on half the ship too has the same result instagib hov not familiar with higher tyrannical but i struggle with heimdall a bit lack of mobility for hpriest is really hurting me hyrja is an absolute pain for the rest its alright i personally think the fortified kings are worse at the end nl joke all around push higher keys here when tyrannical week second boss is just a drag since it lasts so long and you waste a fuckton of time playing an improved game of barrels o fun trying to find the correct rock eoa hatecoil if dps is a bit low since everybody starts getting curses and blow each other away otherwise last boss is a real struggle if half your group decides clockwise is the way to go and the other half rotates in the opposite direction even if you call it some people wont listen praise leap of faith to get one back to you feel free to share your experience below people would like to hear if some are personal opinions or if everybody else struggles with it
wow,not_removed,what makes her harder her melees or the abilities id figure start her on right then while shes casting move left and wait while dps hits her
wow,not_removed,you just find another player that wants gold on that server and has gold on your server we also sometimes do friends or guildies a favor by selling cheaper wow tokens to get gold from other servers especially when its on low pop servers
wow,not_removed,you guys are arguing for the same thing now kiss
wow,not_removed,i have a couple of rare vanilla shirts thankfully someone posted a psa here day before prepatch to unequip old shirts on alts so i was able to unequip the day before prepatch i still kind of want to equip it though to add to my collection since im a completionist waiting for legion to see how high the price goes
wow,not_removed,i have it too so fucking heartbroken
wow,not_removed,ah still learning all of tsms terminology i guess wowhead says either way im stuck with it lol
wow,not_removed,thank you for your submission it has been removed from rwow because off topic comments and posts may be removed read the full httpswwwredditcomrwowwikirules if you feel this post was removed in error please
wow,not_removed,the rogue in my group and myself got that as well on our first run suffice to say our guild was pissed as it announces it to the entire guild once you get it xd
wow,not_removed,thank you for your submission jerakal it has been removed from rwow because loot achievement mount posts belong in the please post it there and dont forget your screenshot read the full httpswwwredditcomrwowwikirules if you feel this post was removed in error please
wow,not_removed,wailing caverns will always hold a place in my heart it was the first dungeon i ever ran i got lost repeatedly that place felt fucking massive ran it so many times while questing in the barrens got yelled at for being shit learned to be better
wow,not_removed,brd is definitely my favorite i remember running it countless times and rarely if ever finishing it old scarlet monastery is a close
wow,not_removed,ive gotta go with culling of stratholme i think theres two main reasons why its my favorite i absolutely love arthas and as a whole and i have a lot of good memories of going for the mount had to complete the dungeon in a certain amount of time back when wotlk first came out and it was still pretty challenging for me anyway
wow,not_removed,old strat scholo and brd are all tied in my book
wow,not_removed,i miss the original sunken temple a fair bit i really liked it of stuff thats still around i really like auchindoun the draenic architecture in wod is pretty awesome looking
wow,not_removed,original upper blackrock spire
wow,not_removed,i love violet hold and i have a soft spot for gundrak but my handsdown favorite will always be h halls of reflection the atmosphere is just perfect its so goddamned creepy and reminds you youre in a secluded throne room atop an icy citadel in the middle of a frozen wasteland menwomenand children none were spared the masters wrath
wow,not_removed,trial of the champion and original sunken temple honorable mention to blackrock depths i like my dungeons vast and sprawling you know dungeonlike
wow,not_removed,hunters have unique specs and sv is a very unique spec overall monks are in a good place too
wow,not_removed,i play a warrior on live however i cant stop playing shaman on beta the class hall is pretty fitting the artifacts and follower stories have a good mix of new lore and revisiting the old worldlore i think they really nailed the fantasy with enhancement the mix of short duration weapon enhancements and customization from talents give you a good mix of monitoring self buffs and standard hit when available abilities the rotation has a good flow to it baseline thats only improved by good rng and a lot of procs windfury feels satisfying when it goes off and being able to buff your group is great the dmgself sustain tradeoff feels good and really makes you feel like a strong hybrid again instead of a boilerplate dps that happens to have a heal first time in about years that im considering a reroll
wow,not_removed,id say death knights are achieving it quite well too just from the videos ive watched
wow,not_removed,frost feels about the same got some really cool new abilities though but its still about the same overall tons of damage is from diseases unholy is about the same with a wonky extra pet that a lot of people may not even take super easy to kill and as of right now you cant just summon it back assuming that gets fixed without dropping your other pet then resummoning both of them at the same time its wonky but again still disease oriented and instead of howling blast youre popping blisters to me they feel too much alike and it feels like blizz is scared to make uh a petmaster class blood is made from the same mold to me they really feel similar but not bad
wow,not_removed,thats kinda what you get when other traits are super fucking strong its the same for every single class
wow,not_removed,but something something demon hunter something something special snowflakes
wow,not_removed,exept for afliction warlock who have realy underwhelming golden traits
wow,not_removed,they didnt make the hitbox have a bottom part and didnt think it would be used for the toy twilight totem in areas you can see below the horizon its a real shame yes
wow,not_removed,go back to ur order hall and dalaran
wow,not_removed,as you progress in your class campaign you have to send them on lots of mission to progress in your campaign i cant say for all the classes but for dks it starts when you recruit champions and i am lvl so i guess youre not that far
wow,not_removed,go back to dalaran and you should have an npc pop up and send you back to your order hall did it at
wow,not_removed,if you havent been back to dal since head there first you should get a quest thatll send you back to your class hall just continue with that
wow,not_removed,we need a sidebar item like x days since last accident but x hours since last onyxia on aq map post
wow,not_removed,was not aware it was made yet deleting now
wow,not_removed,this post should be a movieits a very cool story imo
wow,not_removed,hit i go to premade groups click custom start a group make your own group you lazy fuck
wow,not_removed,there are groups that will use someone with a lockout so people can all spam use rolls on it u fucking dickhead
wow,not_removed,makes a thread asking about how to find a group gets told how to find a group and calls person who told him a fucking dickhead i think you just showed who the fucking dickhead is you fucking dickhead
wow,not_removed,typical greasy ass reddit nerds
wow,not_removed,typical greasy ass reddit nerds youre using reddit
wow,not_removed,no one forces you to use the guilds money for repairs
wow,not_removed,kinda an odd question since the answer depends on the person and guild many guilds dont offer repairs and many do i prefer when guilds do because id rather minutes a week on a farm boss than farming gold for repairs then try to farm it myself with garrison chores its just more fun for me
wow,not_removed,sell runs etc is not for repairs mainly they are for gear etc when a new raidexpansion hits my guild only use guild repair on progress raids

wow,not_removed,yes and no mythic boes were selling for for the more desireable slots and you might see a couple every nightbut i personally havent gotten a single boe is all of hfc across any difficulty so some people have made many hundreds of thousands of gold while people like me have made none all because of rng if the guild takes them all sells them all and then offers guild repairsgemsflaskspotsfood etc its basically just socialism its a way of mitigating the rng so that it benefits everyone in the raid and not just the person who got lucky
wow,not_removed,i clearly said i was spending minutes to farm the gold for repairs when my guild sells a heroic archi kill its just my preferred way to farm gold but since you seem in a contentious mood ill offer some actual reasons in favor of guild repairs besides it being my preferred method of gold farming guild repairs removes any excuse not to keep your gear repaired regularly repair costs are unfairly distributed in a raid tanks average more deaths than any role it allows people to miss days without harm if you miss a farm day and dont get a cut then you get nothing for your lack of attendance with guild repairs you can miss and still gain something not everyone can be selfsufficient saving money on repairs may allow people to buy pots or flasks or runes or enchants or gear etc they wouldnt be able to if they were throwing gold down the repair hole no concern people will blow their gold on something useless to the guild like a mount or something guild repairs allows a noncontentious and equitable approach to disbursement you could divine a system and do it manually but why not take advantage of the tools in game guild repairs are often a perk of being in a guild its one of the things which makes a guild attractive over running solo and is often used to entice new members i could go on but like i said in my original post its just a matter of preference some people like guild repairs and theres certainly a case for it and some dont if youre not a fan then dont use it hell even if your guild offers repairs youre not forced to use it still think this is a weird question

wow,not_removed,first you have to complete part of the suramar questline in order to be attuned for it then you have to go through the premade dungeon part of the lfg tool
wow,not_removed,since its a mythic only you have to form a group through the premade groups section of the group finder
wow,not_removed,sorry for the confusion thats what i meant when you start a group using the group finder you cant find the arcway court of stars works just fine though
wow,not_removed,its there just have to select more dungeons as it only shows so many when you first select the dropdown menu
wow,not_removed,lol barrage has destroyed any goodwill we ever had
wow,not_removed,sidewinders is a second barrage and its the top talent for single target and aoe so expect the stigma to get even worse of course the class changes also made hunters hate hunters
wow,not_removed,no two weeks of legion prepatch did not reverse years of hunter stigma
wow,not_removed,wait for demon hunters theyll be the new idiots for a little bit everyone will have one as an alt and most wont know how to play it theres gonna be some bad vengeance tanks dks had a bit of a negative stigma in wrath but it dwindled and hunters have reclaimed the spot through legion demon huntards will be a thing but i bet hunters wont give up the title easily theyll still have pets that can growl and barrage to ninjapull entire rooms
wow,not_removed,the only thing you can do is stop running world quests and run more dungeons and raids world quests ignore your loot spec boss loot follows it
wow,not_removed,world quests ignore loot spec they are classbased only
wow,not_removed,what about legendaryies and the loot spec leveled my shaman to as enh but lootspec is healbecause i will play heal thanks in advance
wow,not_removed,legendaries go by the loot specialization you selected if you open the loot tab shift j by default you can see all legendaries your class can get you can further sort for only the legendaries your spec can get to see which legendaries you can get when in which loot spec
wow,not_removed,good real good
wow,not_removed,those things were great for ae tanking before ae tanking used em in deadmines
wow,not_removed,you never stop playing you just stop subbing
wow,not_removed,yeeeep going through some major health stuff so im broke and cant play but i check rwow at least once every other day
wow,not_removed,i always checked this sub when i stopped playing but the real thing is why i always stopped playing this time with legion thats different i played almost years on vanilla year on tbc months on wotlk months on cata month on mop months on wod and ive been playing legion since mid septembre months and a half and i dont plan to stop even though i only play character druid there is so much to do that i feel like i dont have enough game time even though i play hours a week i guess blizzard did a good job with legion for the first time in years i dont get bored when i log in but im still waiting for a reroll your shitty leg system
wow,not_removed,at the moment i tend to go between periods of playing and not playing i just like to idly keep up on neat stuff too
wow,not_removed,yeah i left it had gotten to the point in which i was just logging on to raid lead get frustrated at the turn up and log off after wiping a hundred times i could feel my mood deteriorating so i decided to stop
wow,not_removed,for me it is the same with league of legends i stopped playing but i still check the subreddit you may grow tired but you dont stop caring
wow,not_removed,yep although im considering to resub just because i didnt give warlocks a fair shot in legion i quit again a few months after legions launch but i think that if i find the enjoyment i used to have with locks in icc i might stay a little longer
wow,not_removed,not very often but yes i do they have me genuinely interested in the storyline for the first time since ulduar ill probably resub in
wow,not_removed,yup ive been unsubbed since early october but still check out whats going on with wow im a relatively casual player and legion burned me out after a couple of weeks it doesnt look liks theres any reason to come back right now so im just waiting to see if they add anything worth while
wow,not_removed,yep im pretty much done until
wow,not_removed,lol i definitely agree id bet that at some point i wind up going back regardless of its for just a day or a year
wow,not_removed,wow thats actually so true stopped mid wotlk and came back beginning of legion all those years i never really stopped even after years i often thought about all those memories everyone moved on and for me wow time stood still coming back was a strange feeling
wow,not_removed,hope it all goes well for you unknown wow friend get well soon
wow,not_removed,hang in there
wow,not_removed,hope you get well soon
wow,not_removed,but once you got all the legs you want why would you continue playing
wow,not_removed,just cause
wow,not_removed,youre a sick dude
wow,not_removed,have this reddit bronze champ
wow,not_removed,because its not about getting the legs its about using them in pve content such as raids and myth the thing with legion is you can always improve no matter what content you do this is why it feels like theres so much to do even when playing a lot
wow,not_removed,started playing a little after launch until cata then left until mid wod had great fun but burnt out on daytoday everyday grind maxed out artifact reps legendaries really looking forward to updates including flying and content
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,can confirm as evidenced by
wow,not_removed,get your shit together those arent even pandas you might be wanting to look into druid if thats your style
wow,not_removed,is that bear being a badass with the stick real does any one know the source if it is
wow,not_removed,reality is drunken panda bear class fantasy checks out
wow,not_removed,i expect a badass pandaren like the one in the trailer fighting against the human and the orc but browsing this sub ill never create one i was thinking about it
wow,not_removed,httpiimgurcomgyvjndigifv
wow,not_removed,am i the only one who actually likes playing brewmaster
wow,not_removed,should do one of these about warlocks
wow,not_removed,dude if you want to play a bear role a guardian druid not a monk
wow,not_removed,okay going to be a dissenter here i dont get the hate on brewmasters for the old bm players that dislike the new playstyle i get that we lots of classes have that feeling but theyre not weak far from it in fact they are super survivable their stagger is op as fuck and theyre generally just really solid all around
wow,not_removed,i honestly dont see the problem with bm i main mw and gave bm a try for a little while even with a barely upgraded weapon i didnt feel particularly squishy i miss dizzying haze more than i miss guard although fortifying brew being on a cd is a big steaming dump
wow,not_removed,how is a bear falling around the representation of what youre trying to say doesnt make any sense
wow,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvghggfukbvu years ago some guy in japan made a bear kung fu video
wow,not_removed,answer this man please
wow,not_removed,considering russians can train bears abusively mind you to ride unicycles its not really surprising that they can be trained to twirl sticks
wow,not_removed,excuse me could everyone stop assuming all brewmasters are pandas i feel like there is some serious racial pigeonholing going on here im a drunken cow thank you very much
wow,not_removed,look to be totally honest i love my brewmaster you should make one they are great fun dont let any of the negativity put you off playing what is one of the most enjoyable tanks the only reason a lot of us brewmaster are crying for a buff is so that we can actually on equal footing in the competitive scene if you arent playing at a very high level brew is perfectly fine
wow,not_removed,owch
wow,not_removed,what do you like about them im on the fence about making one
wow,not_removed,or just git gut they are not that bad anymore i main destro lock
wow,not_removed,brewmaster tank gets hit for damage with isb up he takes and converts to stagger assuming it was a melee whitehit if it was an empowered hit or did any type of nonphysical damage he instead takes right away almost outright killing him and converts to stagger he can then remove of the stagger damage by using double purifying brew which means you are using all brew charges but still takes damage and dies must use all available brew mitigation and still receive healing in order to not die prot warrior tank gets hit for damage with ip up he takes damage no matter what the source was and thats just from the one ability with no charge system like brews do
wow,not_removed,yeah this is just a shitpost i thought we got most of these out of our system during launchweek
wow,not_removed,there is a difference between being able to do a job and doing it well its why the vast majority of mages play fire because given the choice most will tend to the one that is most efficient picking a warrior tank for your raid is for players who look at the dps charts and decide to play a specclass that is in the top people who play bm are those that are happy enough to limp along and play a classspec in the bottom they really need a buff and its crazy blizz havent bothered yet
wow,not_removed,bearly upgraded ftfy
wow,not_removed,fortifying brew cd is more like to minutes since its cooldown gets reduced by keg smash and tiger palm like all other brews
wow,not_removed,man what an awesome bear i can only imagine how many times i would whack myself in the face if i tried that
wow,not_removed,eh it fit with the shit post so i went with it
wow,not_removed,oh ok ty i thought it was terrible at any lvl for what i was reading
wow,not_removed,by far the most rewarding tank to play for players who always tanked imho other than that tanks now feel dull
wow,not_removed,theres so many ways to screw it up but when you get it right and its not by accidentfeels amazing i got this woo meanwhile my wife just keeps saying its hilarious to watch my drunk monk tanking kegs flying everywhere flame breath weapon chugging brews like no mortal should be able to from a flavor standpointits a lot of fun
wow,not_removed,i really like the style of them like you just drink beer to negate damage etc and that they deal very much damage in comparison to other tanks and well i also love pandaria and if you do a brewmaster make it a pandaren best race for monks imo
wow,not_removed,true but as a pure dps class we should push out more then being in the midcompartment of dps since we pretty much have nothing else these days but it doesnt help that our mechanics are so insanely clunky that it isnt exactly fun to play them since we need to really perform well to do ok hell id be happy if they just changed de in demonology to be less of a spamfest tool
wow,not_removed,i saw some theorycrafting on wlocks and apparently the demonology will outperform all ehat are your thoughts and feelings on this do you spec demon for harder fights or do you find that destro works just as well in practice
wow,not_removed,first brewmaster reduces damage of enemies by breath of fire blackout strike thus taking only damage from attack and also brewmaster can dodge and does that pretty frequently taking damage instead of damage also stagger cant kill you you always stay at hp even with heavy stagger of million damage with base dodge and mastery you have chance to dodge every attack chance to dodge every attack chance to dodge every attack thus making the total resulting damage very low not counting parry at all also brewmaster with common crit chance takes aproximately more incoming heals thus making healers life easier chance for more healing also explosive keg makes enemy miss all attacks for this works against bosses and even against aoe attacks like the giant in eye of azshara does thus mitigating of damage finally gift of the ox as a brewmaster im basically immortal unless stunned at hp soloed mythic helya and last brh boss without any problems with few orbs you can heal yourself instantly for nearly millions health if celestial fortune triggers or millions without it my record is million heal without celestial fortune have i forgot about mobility not a single aoe can hit brewmaster with little to no effort you can just just press rollchi torpedotranscendence and you are out of the danger also the brewmaster artifact is absolutely great looking i really do not understand all those hate posts brewmaster is great absolutely great
wow,not_removed,this one scenario while mathematically true doesnt look at the broad picture of the entire package for brews though nb before anyone hateposts or downvotes i do think brews need some buffschanges however the above scenario doesnt take into account any of the other mitigation elements that brews have they are not suppose to be warriors they are supposed to have a more nuanced style id hate if they gave us ignore pain guard back however the problem i feel is that brews have a more complicated nuanced playstyle that requires the player to time certain buffs and effects as perfectly as reasonably possible just to achieve what other tanks can without the same level of complexity the problem with this is blizz cant make perfectly played brews too good otherwise it forces every hardcore mt to reroll brewmaster at the same time they cannot leave it as it is where the class is entirely unrewarding to play effectively and downright punishing if you are not the best
wow,not_removed,brews are still imo rightfully salty about the state of the classes performance compared to other classes
wow,not_removed,but brewmasters arent even the worst tanks middle of the pack id say
wow,not_removed,its mt first tank p
wow,not_removed,i completely agree with you its quite sad situation that a lot of fire mages outperform you with worse gear and smile at their face a lot of sources say that warlock is tankier version of mage but i cannot say that we have some kind of advantage in terms of survability in compare to them we will see what are they planning to do about this balanc of fire mage versus arcanefrost and mage versus warlock personally i somehow liked lvling with demo but how you said casting of de after each demon is just so boring design decision that even stat balance have no chance to make it more interesting for me once again i cannot consider shards as boost for demo at all
wow,not_removed,i played demo as main before class fixes when i once just for fun changed to destro i was able to perform same dmg with even basic weapon which was quite sad moment for me so i stayed with destro since then i am not very lucky at drop so i currently have critmastery gear which is not much viable for demo spec low level on weapon but from what i saw on raids where was another lock as demo with same ilvl on single target boss fight he was able to make like more damage than me any other boss where was more targets i was above him without much problems maybe with perfect items and build will be situation different
wow,not_removed,i dont think this or any of the others over the last few days should be considered hate posts they come from a place of love for the spec not hate its just that since legion launch brewmasters have been quietly sitting at the back of the bus waiting for blizzard to make some small qol changes and a few minor balance tweaks to make the brewmaster competitively viable a lot of us were quite shocked that brewmasters didnt get a pass in the recent balance hotfixor at the very least acknowledged all we have really had since launch was a damage nerf that wasnt even really targeted at brewmaster tanks at the moment im running an prot paladin and a brewmaster there is a very noticeable difference in toughness between these two classes when you play them back to back as it stands now my paladin has cleared mythic hov with no real problems i expect him to be before the reset brewmaster struggles to survive and brings none of the utility of the paladin this is running with the exact same team only rotating out the tank
wow,not_removed,warriors are supposed to have a magical shield right
wow,not_removed,which would be the worst then in your opinion actual data current top on wowprogress for men is pointing at demon hunters death knights and brewmasters and even then brewmaster is the only one of those with absolutely appearances in any of the top mythic kills out of the tank logs on warcraftlogs are for brewmasters with the next lowest being for demon hunters and for death knights something is very wrong with brewmasters
wow,not_removed,all right on what level do you play raids heroic mythic what is your average ilvl and average dps our guild is lacking a wlock and im thinking of rolling one if they can be viable for some of the heavier fights
wow,not_removed,hey if you want discuss semantics and theme realism how the hell does staggering reduce the damage of a spear straight to the stomach besides i dont think of it as a magic shield its just the warrior shrugging it off he aint got no time for these pathetic weakling hits
wow,not_removed,this i get people feel they want to defend their choice in class because of confirmation bias but not admitting there is an issue at this point is just insanity if the top players are largely avoiding a class then there is something wrong
wow,not_removed,i dont seeget it
wow,not_removed,the small panda cub on the left is also nomi as he appeared during mop he was involved with cooking quests and was sort of a noncombat pet you could summon the adult nomi appears in legion the first time you get a new recipe to give you a quest explaining that hes grown up and is a proper chef now
wow,not_removed,think of the internet as a series of tubes clogging up some of those tubes will hinder your access to blizzards servers
wow,not_removed,the short version is because your computer isnt plugged directly into blizzards servers assuming that is that you dont work at blizzard it has to travel through a number of other servers to get to blizzard and those other servers can also be slowed down by ddos
wow,not_removed,you live in ottawa you want to take a trip to toronto its rush hour and theres gridlock on the highway traffic is fine in toronto but it doesnt matter because you cant get there while the highway is gridlocked
wow,not_removed,blizzard is one end of the train line youre at the other end and the ddos organized flash mobs at the stations in between holding open the doors and jumping on the tracks so the train cant move
wow,not_removed,because if the isp is disrupted internet traffic can not pass between blizzards servers and us imagine blizzard as an island and the way to and from that island is a bridgeif you take the bridge out no one is getting to that island
wow,not_removed,imagine that the server is a toilet which can handle normal amounts of shit being flushed now a ddos is when a bunch of people take dump at the same time and over flow the toilets capacity at flushing shit
wow,not_removed,to my knowledge the attack on the isps is whats causing the lagg as they are where the worldsservers are hosted that would then go back to blizzard for the other info
wow,not_removed,short answer isps cant do much because the internet is made with shit tech
wow,not_removed,contractually it is the isps job to sort it out since its a service failure on their end sometimes there are clauses about having content that incites a large amount of traffic to the point of disruption but i doubt blizzard would sign to that problem is theres not much isps can do about it either its a fundamental problem with how the internet works
wow,not_removed,because blizzard needs internet in order to serve things with their servers kinda obvious
wow,not_removed,blizzard added pretty heavy ddos protection sometime ago however any ddos attempt on them has to go through the isps that they serve traffic out of they dont have the same level of protection as blizzard has on their own servers so they experience problems in the end theres little blizzard themselves can do other than wait it out or attempt to route through another isp but even most of thats out of their hands
wow,not_removed,remember al gore and the internet remember the internet is a bunch of tubes right now people are plugging the tubes that lead to blizzards servers choking us out of them
wow,not_removed,if it is actually targeting their service provider there is nothing blizzard can do the problem however seems to not impact low population servers at all if it was truly a ddos the problems would be indiscriminate at this point i think blizzard just throws that abbreviation out there anytime something happens because this is very clearly not a ddos
wow,not_removed,imagine your neighborhood comes over to your house to use the bathroom not a single one of them flushes they take the most epic shit followed by a full roll of toilet paper someone decides to flush the toilet shit soggy toilet paper and yellow water goes everywhere thats basicallly a ddos
wow,not_removed,with the series of tubes intro i was already cringing but its a fairly apt description in this case although in general its not the bandwidth the tube itself thats getting clogged rather the traffic controllers
wow,not_removed,replace servers with routers and thats close
wow,not_removed,ted stevens not al gore
wow,not_removed,i play main sin and alt havoc the havoc is far easier to both level and do pve and pvp on gearing a havoc is easier and doing competitive levels of damage in both st and cleave is easier
wow,not_removed,honestly as a dh leveling mine is as well im having a lot of fun pulling everything almost dieing then just whiping them all out but at the same time i have a assassin rogue and ive been playing it hardcore its quite fun it just comes down to preference really do you prefer mobility of the dh or the stealth aspects of rogue
wow,not_removed,ahhh my bad but id still suggest dh due to being hybrid incase of he ever wants to tank
wow,not_removed,dh by far
wow,not_removed,probably demon hunter due to starting at and easier mobility with the gliding
wow,not_removed,i think you missed the point he already has both suggestions at lvl
wow,not_removed,it would seem likely that frost and fury recieve some love but its more of a question of when not if blizzard wont leave fury in this state forever but now we get to see if they intend to fix it quickly or save it for a major patch which would suck despite how it may seem sometimes blizzard does attempt to balance well but for some reason or another they dont like making major changes outside of major content patches as such while fury might have its damage buffed or its healing increased i honestly dont think it will mechanically change until at least right now im just hoping they do some small few buffs to make us competitive buffing our execute phase both the damage and the timer on juggernaut buffing furious slash so its not worthless some extra selfhealing on bloodthirst or a shorter cd on enraged regen we have a solid toolkit for dps it just simply doesnt do enough just have faith that we wont be trashtier forever and that when our dps is buffed we will be a great fun spec that will be able to do good in most situations
wow,not_removed,at least i can feel good bursting for a few million dps on trashsigh
wow,not_removed,not going to ever say i liked the wod arms play style but i did like the concept where arms did well on target and target aoe fights vs fury doing well on single target and meat cleaver and target fights now its more like arms is the best for single target and plummeting with each and every nerf and fury is the best for all types of aoe while not having single target viability this could be fine but fury should have something buffed at least give us the wild strike gcd for our garbage filler talent on furious slash which would make frenzy a better talent and would indirectly help us proc our enrage more
wow,not_removed,fury almost always starts weak then overshadows most other specs once gear happens
wow,not_removed,have we ever been this low
wow,not_removed,we were pretty damn bad at the launch of wod actually funny enough for a similiar reason we are bad now we were very very good prexpac so we got a nerf before the expansion even launched which caused us to be very bad at wod launch similiar to how we were excellent during legion beta but got nerfed to the point we are at now the good news there is that fury got some significant buffs pretty quickly after wod came out and iirc we are even worse off now than we were then so expect em
wow,not_removed,if you go through there on a horde character its a rare
wow,not_removed,i would put a gtx ti in there to get the most out of your cpu the integrated graphics can run wow but its not ideal gtx ti is really ideal here going much higher and youre looking at noticing the limitations of your cpu too often your is fine for its price but its not really in the same class with gtx and higher those are best paired with a haswell or skylake quad a balanced system will run consistently whereas an unbalanced system will run very well in some titles and comparatively not very well in others ssd would definitely be the second best upgrade check out crucials new for really good price per gig and a good solid product with acceptable speeds if you get a ti and a youre looking at like ish to make that thing scream
wow,not_removed,solid advice here op
wow,not_removed,thank you so much ill probably get them both appreciate your reply
wow,not_removed,zotac sold most of their stock on amazon for their ti mini gigabyte makes a similar one and theyre still in good stock so the price is lower zotacs one was the price of the gigabyte one last night when i posted check out this alternate if you want to save some moneys zotac and gigabyte make really similar quality items so just buy the better priced one i suggested two single fan ti cards because prebuilt cases have very spotty support for dual fan cards you could measure the space in your case and buy one that is the right length but going with a shorter one is the quick and easy way ti is a really cool running card that doesnt require a dual fan cooler so its not a big deal to just buy a highly compatible one
wow,not_removed,god damn it
wow,not_removed,the wheelchair
wow,not_removed,this joke is months old get out
wow,not_removed,the d
wow,not_removed,i dont get it
wow,not_removed,he is a bear that has a berserk phase bearserk sounds kinda like berserk so this is a pun
wow,not_removed,bad bad pun but a pun nonetheless it was almost too much to bear
wow,not_removed,they look damaged you should get those cracks in the blades looked at one good swing and theyll shatter
wow,not_removed,nice bug you used prot to get it
wow,not_removed,you can get yourself a permanent one in highmountain called
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,that is freaking amazing thanks
wow,not_removed,excellent the arcane one did get a new visual hate the old mana shield
wow,not_removed,the fire one is a little too bright i think it looks pretty distracting id love it if the made it just a bit transparent
wow,not_removed,do people log for m can probably just see if theres any hidden satyr damage
wow,not_removed,just tried it i do still have the effects of gemsenchants as a prot paladin and ive never seen any reduction in stats on me or had any party member talk about it either httpeubattlenetwowencharactersylvanasanucciaadvanced to show that i have gemsenchants
wow,not_removed,i hope this isnt the case
wow,not_removed,went to warcraft logs grabbed a random hidden satyr was doing damage
wow,not_removed,quite a few people do ill have to check it out soon ill see if i can log some later
wow,not_removed,was that inside link done in an m
wow,not_removed,thread
wow,not_removed,yes you can see the timer to the right
wow,not_removed,they removed pvp currency a bit ago you get little caches for doing pvp sometimes they have gear
wow,not_removed,wait you only get the mount if you reach prestige cap in that specific season shit gotta get my pvp on need another levels
wow,not_removed,where did you gather info that your prestige resets when a season ends
wow,not_removed,comment on the page you listed if you had bothered to read it is a part of a random daily just keep checking daily till it appears
wow,not_removed,there is no right answer or wrong answer if you are interested in advancing your characters strengths i suggest you do the shipyard quest line and then the tanaan jungle introduction and dailies if that interests you i personally recommend seeing the content you missed you can certainly solo all precata content likely most of that too
wow,not_removed,i think you should do whatever you find most interesting and just work your way from there if youre into pvp start farming honor on bgs or skirms if you like pve do men instances lfr slowly getting to normal raids but i dont do pve much so better wait for someone elses reply there is still a lot to do in the game but the amount of draenor content leaves much to be desired
wow,not_removed,i would recommend working towards flying because any future character you decide the level of play will then be able to fly through that content thats just my thoughts though
wow,not_removed,are you have you picked up the quest from the main tower in dalaran the one with all the archmages
wow,not_removed,that quest doesnt even show up until but youre correct the suramar breadcrumb quest starts with khadgar
wow,not_removed,you say this like its a bad thing
wow,not_removed,its natural that youll spend a lot of time maelstrom capped when sb procs happen backtoback or during cooldowns lustwolves means that youll pretty much generate more maelstrom than you can get rid of
wow,not_removed,and also since boulder fist cool down resets very quick and i have to use it again in order to keep the buff gets me capped in maelstrom always i have critical haste mastery
wow,not_removed,it kinda is cuz i panic on what to do nextcontonue the rotation of dump maelstrom kinda thoughts
wow,not_removed,how is your mastery so low im at are you not stacking mastery main stat
wow,not_removed,this makes zero sense then you should be having a hard time keeping malestorm with these stats no offense but you have to be playing the class wrong you getting so little procs i have no idea how you are even getting close to capped maelstrom a lot cl ss should always be used on cd idk sounds weird maybe since you have no button to push besides your buffs because you get no procs still makes no sense because you haste is so damn low also
wow,not_removed,priority is keeping frostbrand boulderfist and flametongue buffs active then if you have the crashing storms talent or will hit or more targets cast crash lightning then stormstrike then lava lash
wow,not_removed,keep your buffs up like what was said already you should really only be using lava lash when nothing else is available which isnt very often
wow,not_removed,im not really focusing on mastery even though i know its my strongest stat i just wanna get to a highe rilvl currently and most of the gear dropped for me is crithaste
wow,not_removed,doomwinds will cap you on maelstrom real quick enh sham here pull consistent dps peaking around single target i have times whre i am capped and then others where i am starved its highly depend on wf procs and stormbringer
wow,not_removed,when did i say i get no procs i get quite a bit of procs
wow,not_removed,i always thought cl was worth using even on opponent because its ticks can proc ss as well as giving your next ss a damage boostalbeit small because it only hits one enemy but a buff is a buff
wow,not_removed,you obviously get procs just much less to the average enh shamman most shammans have over mastery either way to answer your question just use lava lash until your around maelstrom and then wait for ss or cl to come back up by the time your done using lava lash of the should be off cd most of the time
wow,not_removed,yes cl ll
wow,not_removed,i believe it is only a dps increase edit against target if you are talented into crashing storms but i could be wrong about that additionally i have the wrist that buffs ll damage making it slightly more worthwhile although still bad
wow,not_removed,do i l use crash lightning as soon as its off cool down i have the talent specced
wow,not_removed,yeah yeah pretty much want to keep that aoe on the ground as much as possible it only lasts seconds weapon buffs always take priority though
wow,not_removed,yes the talent makes its damage per maelstrom spent higher so it is very much worth it also when your feral spirits are up using cl triggers their aoe skills
wow,not_removed,ticket a gm to see if they can help you check if any of the npcs in the quest chain has the quest for you or farm another hilt
wow,not_removed,in the hopes of getting some help as well i have a battered hilt but says alliance only im horde think this was handed to me by a guildie i was a noob at the time so i just kept it in my bank what can i do with it
wow,not_removed,sell it on the ah alliance players can buy it and they go for about so you can make some coin the only issue is that it will sit there for months because its so rare and expensive and only used for transmogs
wow,not_removed,oh didnt know alliance players can buy them will do
wow,not_removed,nowasnt tanked so no one was kickedthe pic is of of the same npc glitched it hadnt despawned from previous kill when new one spawned next to body
wow,not_removed,altz hides your hud for future screenshots ability bars text box and all that altz again to bring it back
wow,not_removed,ill need to remember that i recently came back to the game after not playing for a year thanks
wow,not_removed,does anyone know where i can find mankriks wife
wow,not_removed,those were fond times for me the chuck norris jokesanal memeswindseeker measuring contestsand cant forget about the crazy chat macros that leaked around the spam filters particularly right before a server was being shut down for maintenance it was so much fun
wow,not_removed,your mom op
wow,not_removed,httpwwwwowheadcomsearchqdarnassusquartermaster repeat this search replacing darnassus with the other cities and voila
wow,not_removed,thanks
wow,not_removed,whats kangs bindstone
wow,not_removed,awesome
wow,not_removed,really cool nice
wow,not_removed,fucking majestic
wow,not_removed,thats actually pretty sweet
wow,not_removed,dude
wow,not_removed,fun detected
wow,not_removed,a toy from the timeless island in pandaria gives a very small chance to turn a enemy to stone if you deal the killing blow it just changes how the corpse looks can be looted normaly and every thing
wow,not_removed,its actually an intended effect in this instance
wow,not_removed,dead horse beaten
wow,not_removed,its always worked on raid bosses i think the best one ive gotten was sha of fear that was pretty cool
wow,not_removed,i was gonna post this thanks for the taking the downvotes for me oo
wow,not_removed,maybe if its downvoted enough blizzard wont see it d
wow,not_removed,its not from the timeless isle its from a rare in the valley
wow,not_removed,this is vote manipulation well downvote him without listening to you
wow,not_removed,true but there is a toy that does exactly the same thing that drops on timeless isle
wow,not_removed,yes vale thats what i meant wowhead comment said valley so i just went with that because i didnt think about it
wow,not_removed,wwwgoogledksearchqwowvaleof wwwgoogledksearchqwowvalleyof
wow,not_removed,granny marl is one of the best npcs so far
wow,not_removed,well i fixed it by updating elvui kept all my settings literally download the new files from their website and drag into your addons folder it will keep all your settings
wow,not_removed,i done it that was and it was all messed up i am having to go through every option and fins out what everything actually does so i can get it back to what it once was
wow,not_removed,after i updated it everything was perfect try to load a profile
wow,not_removed,something like httpsmodscursecomaddonswowcanimogit
wow,not_removed,why do you need an addon if it is already in the ui
wow,not_removed,this is a great addon im using it
wow,not_removed,combine it with httpsmodscursecomaddonswowtiertokentooltip
wow,not_removed,it only tells you in the default ui if you havent collected it for that toonarmor type wont help if you come across a boe for another armor type if you have it or not
wow,not_removed,this is a life saver one of the best mods to have now with the new system
wow,not_removed,it does tell you for other types
wow,not_removed,you will get the loot in your mail dont worry about it
wow,not_removed,alright lol i played for like hours today so maybe it will come when things die down i put a ticket in just in case i was just curious if other people had the same issue it was like taking candy away from a baby lol
wow,not_removed,it doesnt appear any more frequently than other secondaries and its pretty damn strong for a lot of the tanking healing classes
wow,not_removed,i dont i have umm level i think i may have lost count
wow,not_removed,i dont know it seems like every xpac ill decided on a main then slowly switch to another class then somehow ended up on my hunter honestly i like my hunter alot he was my first to on ever so he idk seems like he has much more value than my other toons i think going to go straight into legion with him and see how that turns out
wow,not_removed,heck if i know i created mages in one weekend just because i liked different names and their all level now
wow,not_removed,how do you prioritize or stay true to one toon i dont play what you want
wow,not_removed,ive decided to use legion to force myself to pick a main havent decided what that will be yet but at least ive recognised that i have a problem and im doing something about it
wow,not_removed,i fulltime tank for that tank queue paladin has a ton of safety buttons they got all the glowyholy effects and i cant stand the other tanks dk monk kills me druid was meh i couldnt get into warrior basically i found one toon and spec that i liked and convinced myself the other ones made me miserable
wow,not_removed,i actually find it hard to understand how some people can put of their time on a single toon theres so much variety in this game i love to experience it all
wow,not_removed,you just dont embrace youll have one that will be your main because you play them the most and love the style of them at what not but youre always going to want to be another class at some point thats the joy of of alts
wow,not_removed,this there is no one toon there are only all of them
wow,not_removed,you arent alone fellow hunter
wow,not_removed,but then youll miss all the other storylines from opening artifacts
wow,not_removed,i never said i wouldnt do the intro quests or even that i wouldnt level my alts im going to try and restrict my raiding to one toon until i prove beyond all doubt that its not for me
wow,not_removed,if you dont plan on doing anything on your alt for several weeks until patch hits yes
wow,not_removed,you got a long time before patch so i would say start the chain and get just the first few chapters done
wow,not_removed,i am currently doing the same thing on my alt i am just going to keep gearing via low mythic and getting ap that way one thing i have done though is started suramar get the starting quests out the way so you can start doing the withered training you want to start grinding that rep then stop doing the quests when comes out you will be able to just go grab the ap
wow,not_removed,the druid discord is filled with knowledgeable people
wow,not_removed,here if your not already id suggest using cultivation as you get a ton of value on m ursoc even more so during progression
wow,not_removed,list of specs and items top performing druids are using in mythic also one thing to note on our guilds ursoc kills even the healers should be doing dps at least on the initial pull prepotting even and whatever you can throw during the little downtime you have during the fight
wow,not_removed,not a healer but you would get more responses if you link logs of your wipes also i believe there is a subreddit dedicated to this kinda stuff rcompetitivewow i think maybe someone else can input hope this steers you to an answer
wow,not_removed,mythic resto druid main here make sure you coordinate your teams healing cooldowns with every charge like for example first charge tranquility second chrage divine hymn and so on if someone gets shot by the charge some people werent soaking drop efflorence always after second roar and right after ursoc roars move to the direction youre supposed to go before miasma spawns
wow,not_removed,id personally stay away from the discord or at least view it very carefully lots of really trash advice gets thrown around in there
wow,not_removed,is there a good resource on learning how to use ghanir to its full potential
wow,not_removed,to add to this some groups pop hero right at the start with damage prepots on the healers as well if the healers can push out damage per healer that could make the difference between a wipe or a clear just make sure all the healers prepotstat potion works well as it also boosts your heals and have their hots on the tank thats pulling first and you can easily do a good before the first charge after first change its back to straight healing
wow,not_removed,thank you for your advice mate i will redirect my attention over there then cheers
wow,not_removed,depends on the discord the monk one is great
wow,not_removed,pop lust at start pray to elune you have enough dps when he enrages at then
wow,not_removed,yeah the priest one is amazing my experience with the druid discord is that you have to throw out like of what you see in there
wow,not_removed,oh too bad disregard my advice about the druid then
wow,not_removed,there are some good resources there though they have the pinned posts for bis trinkets and all that thats not that bad just be careful when you read stuff and check it against top logs and make sure what they are saying is matching up with the numbers
wow,not_removed,no they just had a huge qa they did and said it isnt and wasnt ever meant to be
wow,not_removed,it unlocks your appearances crossspec but not across all of your characters
wow,not_removed,when of the other skins you have unlocked have been account wide why did you think this one random one was bad troll is bad
wow,not_removed,did they mention anything about balance of power or at least being able to lfr it
wow,not_removed,just checking is it character wide at least ive done it on my warrior but dont have prot and fury hidden to check and im currently doing it on my boomie and just got the resto hidden but havent completed wq yet with my boomie hidden trying to do the achievements as resto would be a pita
wow,not_removed,according to topvoted comment i havent tested it though
wow,not_removed,yep they mentioned it you will not be able to lfr it it is also only percharacter not accountwide
wow,not_removed,i had outlaw and assassination hidden and i got both i had them both when i completed it but not when i started it percent sure it is cross spec
wow,not_removed,it is i got it on my fire mage which had the hidden appearance unlocked and it unlocked for my other specs even though i havent even gotten the hidden appearance for them
wow,not_removed,thats only accountwide because making people do archaeology on every toon is a waste of time compared to other the other tints having some sort of actual endgame content tied to it
wow,not_removed,it is thats a recent change as of i think
wow,not_removed,well ill be damned after there have been so many blue posts about not making things account wide as its a personal journey im not even mad im impressed
wow,not_removed,well shit add that to the list of how alt unfriendly this xpac is
wow,not_removed,well to be fair achievements are nothing holding back an alt quite the opposite its more to do on an alt if you wish to do so not having the achievement doesnt hinder you in any ways
wow,not_removed,i can attest leveling a prot war and pulling the world i had a grin after that part
wow,not_removed,took a similar pic was fun as disc
wow,not_removed,just so people know you can just pull them over to the nearby vindicator dudes who will fight with you basically trivializing the fight
wow,not_removed,i didnt kill him i also didnt do the last stand quest that was there i feel like ive skipped something
wow,not_removed,i just pulled him to the nearby camp and everyone rekt him
wow,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing on my vengeance dh she was literally in a pile of corpses it was a scene right out of illidan
wow,not_removed,sadly i didnt have a sea of bodies they were just piled up because i pulled everything and one shot them with my artifact spell
wow,not_removed,take nearby portal wait for draenei support to come in and start pulling doggies tag boss watch draenei wreck his face collect loot
wow,not_removed,why blackout your actionbars some super secret abilities you wanna keep from us
wow,not_removed,congratz
wow,not_removed,my ui is shit right now dont want hate about it lol
wow,not_removed,how do you see any of your ability cds through the black blobs s
wow,not_removed,im a hunter man i just gotta faceroll
wow,not_removed,the guild im raiding with has had the mount on farm since christmas i guess i didnt highlight it enough but the think im happy about is being promoted to core
wow,not_removed,of us are herbalists we spend hours each before raids to farm herbs and everyone has their own zone to farm for example i do stormheim another disaster highmountain another suramar etc then one person with the most rank is the crafter for procs we dont give them away to guildies but charge per flask and per pre pot this is so the herbalists alchemists are getting some return on their time investment and the guildies see still saving big money
wow,not_removed,my guild is about people with active players the way it went down is sorta like this people put herbs in the bank alchemists use their own herbs to get rank recipes and people dont duplicate so we have a person with some of the flasks another person with other flasks and of the potions covered by rank spirit cauldrons for the guild the mats to make it are flasks of each type and it can produce flasks so you make a cauldron everyone takes a flask and uses it then everyone takes another flask and keeps it in their inventory thats flasks for the price of more importantly youre effectively trading the cheap flasks stamina for the more espensive agility because you put stam flasks in to make it but only take out if that makes sense stam flasks are cheap because theyre made with cheaper herbs dreamleafaethril compared to agi flasks which are made with fjarn and foxflower have the people with rank recipes make the flasks for the cauldrons dont provide pots
wow,not_removed,our guild alchemist makes flaskspots for people and asks that they supply the roses
wow,not_removed,you shouldnt be expected to provide flasks and repairs for raiding imo
wow,not_removed,one thing you could do is get everyone to pick up the dreamweaver shoulder enchant and toss any herbs it generates into the gbank
wow,not_removed,in my guild everyone brings their own flask pots and food problem solved is either rich or has alt with herbalism
wow,not_removed,our guild doesnt supply flasks for early bosses and soon not on normal at all too expensive tanks and healers and the top dps get enough flasks to stay flasked for the raid night the rest get we raid for so the idea is to save them for actual hard bosses pots are too damn expensive so i just use wod ones
wow,not_removed,we buy wow token and sell in game for gold then put it gb seriously i dont ask how these guys make her money but they sure dont mind spending it on wow
wow,not_removed,if you are progressing heroic or normal you dont need pots because the content is easy as fk flasks can afford everyone on their own
wow,not_removed,only good guild provide flasks and pots what do you think they were doing all of wod they were selling carries to hfc and brf the only reason to do that is to buy stuff for the next tier of raiding if your guild didnt do sales then you cant be expected to provide those things the people in your guild should have an obscene amount of gold from wod i dont know anybody that didnt leave wod with at least gold theres a reason why some people continued to play wod even though it was shit the amount of gold you could make was obscene and wont be replicated in the near future
wow,not_removed,another disaster highmountain well not gonna disagree
wow,not_removed,same here all i ask for is the roses i supply the rest for us its around roses per raidmember as i can proc all but stamina flask i then make cauldrons i got rank last night not sure what it does however
wow,not_removed,this is what my guild does
wow,not_removed,i dont know anybody that didnt leave wod with at least gold i dont know who youre hanging out with but this is definitely not the norm
wow,not_removed,my phone autocorrected does to disaster but its apt so imma leave it
wow,not_removed,and yet im not allowed to use my yard gateway that i have to set up in advance with a second cast when im holding a flag
wow,not_removed,people seem to be confused this is vengence spec that with a talent and a pvp talent they can do yard leaps it makes them a very good flag runner they also get a spd increase for seconds and dispel all magic on them every they make really effective flag runners
wow,not_removed,i dont do much pvp but when i was in twin peaks about a week ago my gliding speed and fel rush distance were severely reduced once i picked up the flag did they revert that change
wow,not_removed,want blizzard to fix it theres one surefire method make your own dh for pvp to use as a flag runner to enjoy the opness it will be patched within a week
wow,not_removed,its not like they go any faster the flag slows you down
wow,not_removed,i dont pvp but i can see it being an issue just please dont take it away for the rest of the world i like my double jump
wow,not_removed,druids shouldnt be able to shapeshift while carrying the flag no one can even remotely keep up its even more ridiculous than the absolutely fucking stupid infinite sprint rogue fiasco
wow,not_removed,monks
wow,not_removed,id say right now monk with the double dragon talent is way more ridiculous you have transcendence that also heals you thanks to a trait two rolls and two serpent kick both spells dispell slows you have tigers lust to clear roots and paralysis on a second cooldown i am literally unstoppable when flag carrying though since monks are very underplayed compared to the other classes this is harder to notice
wow,not_removed,so were all just going to overlook the movement speed of travel form ghost wolf that have been in the game for years i wish players who didnt have the flag could mount up to chase the flag or maybe if other classes had speed boosts like aspect of the cheetah disengage blink displacer beast sprint heroic leap charge divine steed or another good idea would be if we gave other players some slows stuns and snares something like concussion shot hamstring poison hand of hinderence slow entangling roots hex hammer of justice binding shot shockwave pacify sweeping leg strike frost nova typhoon polymorph so i think youre right blizzard should give us more tools to counter things like this
wow,not_removed,except you can actually catch the dh cause shit has a cd
wow,not_removed,what is infinite sprint i only get to sprint for like seconds at a time
wow,not_removed,not sure about now but pvp after launch was ass you could always tell if you were going to win or not depending on how many demon huntersmonks you had
wow,not_removed,in this thread tales from unrated pvp
wow,not_removed,wait isnt the engineering glide thing already available to everyone in pvp
wow,not_removed,honestly i would love them to lose the glide in bgs fuck all of that
wow,not_removed,i am not even sure i get your complaining they are not even one of the best flag runners they are probably the most susceptible class to cc and snares i can see how they can do well against pugs and bad players though
wow,not_removed,imho people are still completely missing the point of why this is an issue in the mop cart map for example havoc dhs can use their abilities to be consistently faster than mounts as a warlock if i cant catch up mounted i literally cant catch them at all the glides and jumps do not have a cd and if you know how to game the terrain on that map gg furthermore a much bigger issue to me is that the glide provides obstacle free and target immune movement across a battlefield that is height dependent and therefore not equal for both sides due to the terrain in wsg or tp if a dh gets airborne with the flag from high enough up they are out of range of abilities and glide with impunity across a great length of the battlefield before people can even target them that is an issue sure monks rogues druids etc have tons of mobility but they can still be targeted cced slowed etc even more on maps like tp the horde demon hunters have a clear and very important advantage because the alliance keep is at the top of a giant hill that gives them that height advantage for pretty much of the traversable map there is absolutely nothing fair or balanced not being able to target the fc until they are well past the river if you play alliance as far as im concerned they need to rather make the goblin hangliders useable while holding the objective or they need to stop dhs from being able to glide in these situations they do the same exact fucking thing as a goblin hanglider but can inexplicably do it while holding objectives it literally makes zero sense and is giving bullshit advantages in bgs right now
wow,not_removed,its becoming pretty clear that they did little to no pvp testing this xpac and apparently they dont intend to correct the worst balance in wows history anytime soon
wow,not_removed,yeah its hard to keep up with them even when youre mounted
wow,not_removed,lol qq
wow,not_removed,demon hunters double jump and glide should be generally disabled in pvp that or make engineering usable in pvp again
wow,not_removed,im sorry but i really dont feel like your complaints are valid demon hunters cant triple jump clear across the map as a flag carrier when you are carrying the flag your speed for glide is significantly reduced and the distance of fel rush is also reduced does the demon hunter have additional speed utility when carrying a flag definitely but literally every other class out there has abilities which make them unique when carrying the flag and its up to you to learn how to counter them for the demon hunter it can be as simple as catching them in a stun and hitting them with a slow thats it without our ability to move we are very squishy and can easily be taken down
wow,not_removed,in the mop bg with the gold cart dhs can jump with it but no other class can sprint i think heroic leap works but with a dh i cant even catch them while mounted
wow,not_removed,goblin glider allows everyone to do thisin randoms druids are even more annoying with shapeshift displacer beast speed boost and the biggest amount of escape cc amongst all classes then there were prelegion rogues that could increase their running speed inifinitely and sprint over water and what not on the other hand you have dhs with fel rushes and a double jump glide with a total of cc escape honestly no big problem and to be fair your complaint is that they have too much mobility while pretty much every class has at least one or two mobility enhancing spells next time you see a dh efc make sure your team keeps him properly ccd and you wont have any problems at all unless ofc you are complaining only about randoms in which case theres a lot of other unfair stuffitems that are allowed in randoms and you really shouldnt be too concerned with it or let it get to you since randoms are meant for casual fun
wow,not_removed,no man you could like teleport in a really weird way once a minute
wow,not_removed,its unfair but the problem is that anyone can use your portal so these dh flagrunners would be a bit worse with that
wow,not_removed,this is the real culprit of ops complaints the spell is called infernal strike and its baseline is charges cd the pvp talent rain of chaos lv gives it additional charge and allows you to leap an additional yds this combined with a couple of other pvp talents that allow a tank dh to ignoredispel your snares and roots makes them extremely effective flag runners right now
wow,not_removed,i mean that doesnt make it any less broken
wow,not_removed,the only confusion on my part is how blizzard didnt see this coming hell i saw it coming as soon as i found out i could doublejump
wow,not_removed,wait dispell magic isnt it just a magic damage reduction or is that a pvp talent
wow,not_removed,i cant wait until they nerf my characters dungeon and raid performance to address this pvp issue
wow,not_removed,shhh x
wow,not_removed,maybe it is only if you pick it up with focused assault after a few stacks i think it caps movement speed bonuses
wow,not_removed,it is more that glide and fel rush are affected by anything that slows you if you get snared they move the appropriate distance less the get the little snare from the flag on the skills
wow,not_removed,on beta infernal strike worked while holding the flag which was the most broken no idea if it is still the case but tank spec with charge sec cd talented yard range heroic leap was pretty funny to see but my award for dumbest dh in bgs thing is how they can double jump straight to the relic chamber from the beach on strand and bomb the door
wow,not_removed,you can also jump and glide over damage sources like pools voidzones and rot patches in pve thats pretty lame tbh
wow,not_removed,i remember the first week of wsg in vanilla when warlocks could summon flag carriers for instant caps that hot fixed fast
wow,not_removed,not even close to the same thing
wow,not_removed,and im sitting here on my priest like yup shield gives me a second speed boost
wow,not_removed,anyone can keep up with druids when they shape shift
wow,not_removed,monks shouldnt be able to spam roll with the flag no one can even keep up its ridiculous
wow,not_removed,and how dare death knights even begin to think using their death grip to pull the flag carrier dont get me started on their other grips either
wow,not_removed,ghost wolf too bro omg what a broken game
wow,not_removed,trying to think of one class not spec that doesnt have a speed buffboost i guess dk but they have the speed boost still mounted so they can get to the flag faster and dg to pull the fc back to them
wow,not_removed,why would they let warriors charge with the flag who can follow that
wow,not_removed,id say right now monk with the double dragon talent is way more ridiculous after debuffs with the flag roll and fsk stop speeding you up just like other classes vengeance dhs can and ill keep doing it till they cant jump yards at will with the flagcarts regardless of debuffs
wow,not_removed,i think you are underestimating how crazy dh are mostly due to the terrain especially in twin peaks or whatever horde side advantage with a dh is insane
wow,not_removed,for a second there i fell into the omg this guy has no clue then the tongue and cheek hit me and i realized i was the fool for a minute there
wow,not_removed,you can actually catch the dh cause shit has a cd you apparently dont know what the op is talking about in twin peaks the alliance fortress is on the top of a hill a demon hunter carrying the flag can double jump off the cliff then glidefelrush spam across a bit more than half of the entire map while in the air he is out of spellcasting range even if you know its going to happen and manually target him you cannot touch him death knights cant deathgrip him casters cant do any damage to him because hes simply too far high up in the air to be hit with anything quick google search here you go heres a as you can see hes landing significantly past the river hes completely invincible and untouchable for over half the map there are other instances of genuine problems this merely happens to be one of the worst ones
wow,not_removed,we had burst of speed as a talent that pretty much everyone took it was like a or second sprint with no cooldown regenning the energy cost from it was just shorter than the duration so you could literally keep it up of the time and each time you cast it it broke all snares
wow,not_removed,prior to this expansion rogues could sprint non stop from the enemy flag room to their flag room
wow,not_removed,that moment when you think you are making fun of the plebs but dont realize rated pvp has never been balanced and anyone who tries it gets turned off by the amount of trailerdwelling year old potheads that mouthbreathe on skype
wow,not_removed,nah vengeance is pretty stupid in rbgs also and can do that stupid glide shit half way across the map on wsg and tp
wow,not_removed,no
wow,not_removed,maybe damage should interrupt the glide
wow,not_removed,and rogues should lose sprint mages should lose blinkshimmerwarlocks should lose demonology portals warriors should lose chargeintercept paladins should lose divine steed monks should lose roll etc they shouldnt lose it but simply have charges in pvp or have damage interrupt it theyll probably keep it for this xpac and have it nerfed in the future like rogues burst of speed
wow,not_removed,yeah and remove the stupid fel rushes and vengeful retreat aswell actually maybe they shouldnt have any abilities at all except for metamorphosis and chaos strike and remove the stun on metamorphosis and remove the leech talent on metamorphosis actually scratch that remove metamorphosis alltogether no abilities but chaos strike now youre balanced ya mouthbreathing weebs amirite
wow,not_removed,vengeance is the best flag carrier right now mainly because of their insane mobility every top rbg team is using them as fcs
wow,not_removed,soooo what youre saying is that as long as something isnt the best you cant have opinionscomplaints about it and if you do youre a noob
wow,not_removed,in pvp and just about everything else the cracks are starting to show
wow,not_removed,so they should lose one of their main abilities
wow,not_removed,what abilities do priests have as flag carriers
wow,not_removed,you cannot use the goblin glider while carrying the flag
wow,not_removed,the is also the abyssal strike pve talent reduces the recharge time to seconds and increase the max distance you can jump
wow,not_removed,rain of chaos is reportedly getting changed it will add a snare to infernal strike instead of the extra charge and range bonus
wow,not_removed,well shit to a battle ground i go then did not know this
wow,not_removed,they knew people in beta were reporting these problems over six months ago blizzard simply chose to do nothing about it
wow,not_removed,its a pvp talent immolation aura will dispel things on you its middle of the middle row iirc
wow,not_removed,its a pvp talent it allows you to dispel magic with immolation aura its ok but not amazing as the majority of things r not magic nowdays
wow,not_removed,i cant wait until they nerf my characters pvp and arena performance to address a raid issue
wow,not_removed,except the talents in question arent available outside of pvp and generally pvp changes have nothing to do with pve now
wow,not_removed,theyve been independently changing pvp characteristics separate from pve
wow,not_removed,they nerfed havoc carrying the flag fel rush goes a shorter distance and you glide ridiculously slow this is all the time and not just with stacks
wow,not_removed,its not little though as glide changes your speed by multiplying it if your speed is at a number less then then it is being multipled by less then when you glide and slowing you even more having the flag fully cripples glide and you cannot just triple jump end to end in bgs with it you drop like a rock with flag
wow,not_removed,for reference if you have an addon that still shows your movespeed on the character sheet every time you fel rush youll see your movespeed hit for the half second you move
wow,not_removed,i dont see how thats any different than a mages blink for example
wow,not_removed,hah apparently dh mains are salty that i called them out on exploiting strand of the ancients or something or people disagree that a tank spec jumping yards every sec with the flag is pretty powerful im almost impressed my comment got all the way to
wow,not_removed,we have one personal cd that is terrible and has to be used for dps we need to be able to jump over shit that you can just walk through
wow,not_removed,mages can blink through them hunters can disengage over them even druids can spec for a mini blinkdash warriors can leap over them not sure what other classes have but it seems like most have a way to get past dangerous areas hell even goblins have a racial ability to do it i dont play a dh the style isnt for me at all but complaining about getting a movement skill that allows them to avoid damage is kinda making me wonder what kind of player you are if you dont realize most classes have it just remembered rogues have the hook grapple thing
wow,not_removed,le reddit snowball has started just let it roll over i guarantee you that if up votes were hidden you wouldnt have gotten even half as many people jumping down your throat sorry to see it
wow,not_removed,double jump and glide is fun tough luck if you dont like it
wow,not_removed,still better than what is dks have
wow,not_removed,can they still teleport with the flag transcendence maybe
wow,not_removed,blizzard is going to see all these comments and think wow these people really hate movement buffs and just remove everything
wow,not_removed,death grip druid displacer beast 🤔
wow,not_removed,another warrior doing a heroic leap
wow,not_removed,as an alliance hunter i find no issue dealing with them they can still be hit while gliding and consequently slowed it is especially great to stun them run as they jump off
wow,not_removed,alliance get av
wow,not_removed,come on bro you know some tart would grab the boots running into the room even if he was the only one going for flag never understood that one
wow,not_removed,yes ive seen this i do this i main dh like i said you will still catch them they have cooldowns and cant really do shit compared to a rogue or druid who just out run you forever
wow,not_removed,and not a single person was like maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe this is a bit strong
wow,not_removed,yeah clearly theres no rated pvp scene the world championships are going on right now but yeah nobody tries it because skype mouthbreathers
wow,not_removed,man rated battle grounds are not balanced
wow,not_removed,that moment when rats come to reddit to voice their opinion thinking that it matters or anyone cares n the legitimacy of wow pvp when they are complete shit themselves xd
wow,not_removed,its not so much the glide your move as fast as walking with the nerf if you dont believe me roll a dh and snag the flag you move as slow as walking havoc does okay because double fel rush blur double fel rush again thats probably what youre seeing but thats still less op as ghostwol or travel form
wow,not_removed,wasnt aware i used to play with a hunter who abused the shit out of to gain better disengage distance in pvp for a long time
wow,not_removed,i remember someone using it just fine a while ago
wow,not_removed,im surprised it doesnt in general to be honest
wow,not_removed,warlocks should lose demonology portals that already happened years ago you cant use them with the flag
wow,not_removed,most warlocks wouldnt care if you took gate its the only movement ability tied to a cast over a gcd and it doesnt do much outside of which is still tied to the fact that you need to set it up and there are so many ranged imterupts its hell to do effectively just saying wed trade it out to have other classes lose some mibility in a heartbeat
wow,not_removed,thank god priests dont have anything cool enough to need nerfs
wow,not_removed,and have it nerfed in the future like rogues and burst of speed but that didnt happen it got removed
wow,not_removed,warlocks cant use portals when carrying the flag or at least they cannot in eots im also not a huge fan of pallys having that divine steed movement shit honestly theres too much movement too much off spec healing and too many bubbles that act as full immunities rather than absorb x amount of damage before breaking
wow,not_removed,dont talk out of your ass just because removing glide would make dh less aids when they are fc doesnt mean im advocating for the removal of all their mobility double dash is annoying but fine that glide should either just not work in pvp or be stopped instantly upon taking damage
wow,not_removed,what do they have for better mobility than havoc
wow,not_removed,there are top rbg teams
wow,not_removed,well if you complain about something thats only an issue for bad players you kind of are
wow,not_removed,while they are carrying the flag yes like many other classes
wow,not_removed,we dont dont let me run the flag god please
wow,not_removed,bubblesself heal
wow,not_removed,if they do something about it of the players will qq cuz they r all maining dhs like release dk´s lul
wow,not_removed,abyssal strike is a pve talent thanks for your input edit you need abyssal strike to get to yards idiots its not all coming from that one pvp talent
wow,not_removed,oh ok thanks for the info
wow,not_removed,i did a wsg days ago and that dh had no restrictions on his glidefel rush as a sub rogue i had issues sticking to him and my main damage ability has a fucking blink on it
wow,not_removed,httppastebincomrdnujimv weakaura string if anyone wants to see movement speed
wow,not_removed,dh jumps dont get caught on pebbles wasting the charge
wow,not_removed,its mostly different because one is a tank spec designed to take no damage and self heal a ton while the other is a squishy dps spec
wow,not_removed,has blink no cooldown dh jump has two charges
wow,not_removed,thats true we must use a cd some of the encounters in en are litteraly just avoid shit on the ground and you can just ignore it im not saying they should remove the awesome mobility you guys have because thats the good part of the class they should just design things making sure it doesnt trivialize mechanics
wow,not_removed,dks dont have anything as far as ive found we can pull most mobs over the obstacle to us i suppose with death grip but otherwise we have no way to avoid running through something wraith walk doesnt decrease damage and just makes us a bit faster for seconds
wow,not_removed,see thats exactly my point those are skills with cds you tend to use them with caution because once you use them you dont have them again for a certain amount of time sometimes most of the time you keep them out of cd just for a certain moment of the encounter double jump and glide is there every time you want or need it is kinda making me wonder what kind of player you are if you dont realize most classes have it oh thank you you are very kind sir im the kind of player wiping on mythic encounters that realizes that while im running around without any kind of immunity trying to avoid stuff the dhs are just flying over my head choosing where to land well at least its healing for me i guess
wow,not_removed,what their power in other areas being mobile wouldnt suit their class identity in the slightest theres a reason they have a pull and not a dash
wow,not_removed,thought you meant the one where they go to the monk temple wouldnt that suck
wow,not_removed,yeah ive seen monks do their roll thing with it
wow,not_removed,nop
wow,not_removed,lets make a class that can be a ranged dps melee dps tank and a healer oh and also give them blink
wow,not_removed,havoc isnt so bad to keep up with yeah they can be slowed while gliding and are very susceptible to roots the problem is tank dhs that have charges of a yard leap on a second recharge leap off the top glide to the bridge leap and they are on the cap point before you can finish mounting up luckily they die easily with coordination so its a non issue in rated its only really an issue in random and blizz shouldnt balance around random play so its moot
wow,not_removed,dh like i said you will still catch them how theyre in the air theyre out of casting range you cant hit them you cant stun them you cant slow them you cant deathgrip them theyre completely untouchable until theyre in range a rogue or druid who just out run you forever nonsense were talking about battlegrounds anybody can mount dont tell me you cant catch us you do realize that demon hunters can outrun druids right if you main demon hunter you should already know this even talented for blink and using travel form demon hunters can move faster than i can i have a three minute cooldown that allows me to outrun you briefly once thats gone theres nothing i can do to move faster than you do if you dont believe me grab a druid and ask to race tell him that dash is on cooldown but absolutely everything else he can do is fair game he cane change specs he can retalent for speed he can use travel form and make blink macrosanything he wants if you use your abilities correctly you will effortlessly keep pace and unlike a resto druid who has to give up his ability to heal while in travel form you can go right on doing damage while you zip and rush and glide around
wow,not_removed,world championships dont mean rated pvp is or balanced or a legitimate esport
wow,not_removed,correct
wow,not_removed,you looked up people on armory i didnt know reddit was linked like that crazy
wow,not_removed,its the charge they get as vengeance the glide because you can glide half way accross the map on either side of wsg if you go ramp and same for twin peaks if youre horde
wow,not_removed,they disabled it and all other engineering abilities in bgs with legion prepatch
wow,not_removed,lmao i played hunter last expansion and now i really wish i thought of that
wow,not_removed,hasnt been usable in bgs since prepatch
wow,not_removed,priests can no longer troll me with life grip
wow,not_removed,hey monks have been able to fly since they came out so i wouldnt get my hopes up
wow,not_removed,infernal strike scales cliffs really well and with talents it goes up to yards
wow,not_removed,even that i am getting downvoted i must agree that you do make a good point i just think that the argument shouldnt just be dismissed on such a subjective basis
wow,not_removed,you mean like rogue sprint spam or druid travel form oh wait
wow,not_removed,isnt the extra leap and extra range a pvp talent thats what the op is complaining about
wow,not_removed,im sorry but the real broken talent is the pvp one the pve one that youre incessantly whining about only serves to make the pvp one even more broken and probably wouldnt even be taken by a pvp vengeance dh if the extra charge talent didnt exist edit keep in mind this sec cd reduction and extra yards is absolute fuck all compared to piling up an extra leap charge feet range a defensiveoffensive dispel on a min cd a second selfdispel seconds of snare immunity with run speed all of these are pvp talents
wow,not_removed,which is not what were discussing
wow,not_removed,so does shimmer
wow,not_removed,welp technically we can do in a row if you count vengeful retreat
wow,not_removed,it doesnt trivialize the mechanic any more than blink does
wow,not_removed,idiot lol you dont think they were aware of what we would be able to avoid while in raids lmao if you actually played a dh youd know that half the time double jumping over bad stuff still hits us for tick of damage of the time it doesnt trivialize mechanics it helps us out sometimes
wow,not_removed,you still take damage when jumping over shit thats on the ground unless youre ridiculously high
wow,not_removed,ya i actually run with a couple dks regularly and they complain about mobility should be used as an argument to increase dk mobility though not nerf dh
wow,not_removed,i just googled first mythic cenarius kill because i heard that was the most difficult encounter and the video shows dh in their raid if the class was overpowered at mythic content which seems to be your gripe wouldnt they use more ive truthfully never understood players like you if you dont have something you dont want anyone to have it
wow,not_removed,from a pvp perspective death grip doesnt do shit against most classes who have blinks leaps and sprints
wow,not_removed,oh and also give them blink i admit that we can teleport doesnt make any sense ill happily give it up if we get rid of other class abilities that dont make sense for example it doesnt make any sense that rogues have a hot but they do for some reason or for example demon hunters can see invisible even though demons dont use invisibility and can double jump like theyre in a nintendo platformer and fly even though that completely doesnt make sense at all or for example paladins who are supposed to be chivalrous avatars of honor and virtue have a stun so they can render an opponent helpless and unable to defend themselves yet at the same time hunters who are supposedly about huntingno longer have traps why on earth would you give rogues a heal over time ability but take traps away from hunters theres a lot of stuff going on that doesnt make sense ill give up my weird stuff that doesnt make sense if we change the other stuff that doesnt make sense too
wow,not_removed,displacer beast is druids entering and exiting the dream very quickly or at least thats how it makes sense to me
wow,not_removed,not perfectly balanced or an esport in an mmo what are you attempting to tell people here something that no one ever said
wow,not_removed,i never said it was i said youre wrong in saying nobody is interested in it
wow,not_removed,how so
wow,not_removed,hes just projecting his own rating onto others
wow,not_removed,hmm thats strange the speed is supposed to be the same as flow fall and when you use charge as havoc the range is reduced if youre airborne do you mean the vengeance heroic leap thing that would make more sense but again its not much different than blinksnowfall combo or heroic leap i think a lot of the problem is that people arent used to countering dh yet yknow especially vengeance aim of dh are havoc
wow,not_removed,you cant glide half way across the map roll a dh grab the flag and try gliding you practically come to a complete stop
wow,not_removed,they disabled tinkers you can still use consumeable gliders source i watched my friend glide as i fell to my death i think it was a side effect of them disabling trinkets in bgs tbh
wow,not_removed,you pretty cant use any items at all in rated pvp
wow,not_removed,bad timing to release a class with glide then
wow,not_removed,thank fucking god
wow,not_removed,ive definitely used gliders multiple times on my demon hunter
wow,not_removed,like many other classes
wow,not_removed,half of the extra range is a pvp talent the other half is a pve talent
wow,not_removed,yes it is heres a relevant quote from the top comment in this chain this is vengence spec that with a talent and a pvp talent they can do yard leaps look at the parts that ive bolded now look at a see how the range is only yards ok now notice how it extends the range by yards ill help you out here does not equal in order to get to yards you need as well which extends the ability another yards see that part of the original quote that i italicized thats the original poster in this comment chain acknowledging that theres a pvp talent and a pve talent that are both required in order to get the effect theyre describing so yes this is what were discussing
wow,not_removed,good idea maybe we should all reroll to demon hunters and act edgy instead of playing to have fun ill start brainstorming more illi names in preparation
wow,not_removed,i dont know what shimmer is and how it relates to blink i was replying on comment not more
wow,not_removed,dh doesnt have to spend a talent point to get double jump though for you downvoters yes im not talking about the actual jump im talking about the move that has charges thought it would be kinda obvious
wow,not_removed,i guess my sac pact is bad design because it trivializes some mechanocs pack it up boys
wow,not_removed,allow me to cast my arcane blasts while moving and you can happily remove blink
wow,not_removed,that doesnt mean its a good design edit keep on downvoting im not saying you dhs are bad or your class is overpowered im just saying some of the main mechanics of some pve encounters are just gone for you because you can double jump and glide over things without worrying
wow,not_removed,i agree with that
wow,not_removed,oh boy can you even read i think the dh mobility is fine and its actually what makes the class fun im just saying they should stop designing encounters where half of the damage can be avoided by jumping
wow,not_removed,dhs are not overpowered at all they are fine and im pretty sure its an extremely fun class to play they lack dps if anything and thats probably why cutting edge guilds that can have hundreds of tries each boss are not bringing them killing the boss is what matters at the end but there is a difference between making a class extremely mobile and hoovering over damage sources that make half of the encounter damage and determine mythiconly mechanics in case you dont get it im talcking about nythendra rot stacks and puddles during that feels wrong i chose my class and i love playing it it lacks mobility and immunities but that has alway been the case im ok with it and i know that in order to down the boss my raid must learn to move and having dhs doesnt make any difference im just baffled that where everyone else is struggling they can just ignore things
wow,not_removed,i agree rogue stopped making sense when they got recuperate in cata just salty dk hasnt gotten anything so far
wow,not_removed,im replying to the implication that existence of a world championships is in any way more than a straw man reply to my original post which was completely serious let me tell you
wow,not_removed,its based on being an mmo and certain classes being inherently imba at certain activities the original comment here seems to imply its a casual pvp problem when you dont have death grips at your disposal to handle this exact situation
wow,not_removed,actually ive been glad every season ive played except my first but we floats your boat kid
wow,not_removed,its a mix of the leap dashes and glide doesnt really matter how fast or slow they are theyre still the best flag carriers in ranked
wow,not_removed,more like they did it on purpose to make the demon hunters feel special
wow,not_removed,which many ones
wow,not_removed,actually the pvp talent gives far more effective range because of the third charge with just the pve talent you can travel yards while with just the pvp talent you can travel having both simply adds an extra to that
wow,not_removed,i am really sad i can not see what he wrote that you so soundly destroyed him on nicely done
wow,not_removed,hey i rolled demon hunter and im not edgy at all im just sitting here in my lumberjack shirt with my axes and my mooses if you got my some tim hortons id be canadian
wow,not_removed,shimmer is a mage talent that gives you charges of blink
wow,not_removed,shimmer is blink with charges its a talent
wow,not_removed,downvotes just because someone doesnt know what a talent in this game is they really need to remove the downvote feature or at least from people who randomly downvote for no valid reason
wow,not_removed,when op was talking about jumping he was talking about infernal strike it has charges on a second cd i believe a pve talent that increases its range by and reduces its charge rate by seconds and a pvp talent that gives it another charge and an additional yards on its range giving a total of yards and charges with a second recharge
wow,not_removed,its so badly designed they renamed it dark pact
wow,not_removed,ok so let me get this straight ice block is bad design because its an immunity to bad stuff on the ground pally bubble is bad design because its an immunity to bad stuff on the ground spriest dispersion is bad because its an immunity to bad stuff on the ground ams is bad design because its an immunity to bad stuff on the ground and encourages the player to step it in it etc so now dh can jump over some things not all try it yourself it doesnt work on all pools and suddenly its op you cant jump over the damn bugs in nythendra i know from getting blown the fuck up and almost getting benched because of it
wow,not_removed,you also still take damage from them the damage boxes actually reach up off the floor
wow,not_removed,no this is what you said you can also jump and glide over damage sources like pools voidzones and rot patches in pve thats pretty lame tbh what youre doing now is backpedaling jump and gliding is two keystrokes blink is one lots of classes are avoiding the difficult mechanics of mythic raids sorry you seem to be having trouble with it though
wow,not_removed,if youre gliding around puddles the entire fight youre not doing damage
wow,not_removed,in case you dont get it im talcking about nythendra rot stacks and puddles during you mean the burn phase where if the dh is gliding theyre not doing dps to the boss
wow,not_removed,in case you werent aware dh can glide over rot but the only time it avoids damage is at maximum double jump distance if youre halfway to the ground but still gliding over say a second rot puddle you will take a tick of damage
wow,not_removed,classes being imba is not as important in a with objectives vs a
wow,not_removed,huh see i would have thought that after the buff where tanks dont take increased damage while holding the flag warriors would be destroying people with mil shield slams and ignore pain i mostly stick to threes and dip into rbgs each season just to farm more saddles im surprised high rank teams are letting vengeance dhs carry the flag with how squishy they are
wow,not_removed,vengeance has leap and glide havoc has dash and glide no spec has all
wow,not_removed,which they did poorly since its only the engineer specific tinker that is disabled
wow,not_removed,the glider tinker on the cloak doesnt work the goblin glider kit consumable does work shit makes no sense but what to expect from blizz
wow,not_removed,ive used well over goblin gliders in legion battlegrounds already you really need to be sure before you act so sure i also use the artifact fishing pole to swim in bgs i also mainly bg on my veng dh and can jump clearly half way across most bgs with leaps without hindrance with a flag or cart yards
wow,not_removed,in the prepatch paladins couldnt use steed charge when carrying the flag
wow,not_removed,maybe you should reroll then
wow,not_removed,maybe you should reroll then
wow,not_removed,its blink with charges but removes the ability for blink to break stuns or roots
wow,not_removed,yeah but i got an answer before it got buried so im satisfied
wow,not_removed,downvote u
wow,not_removed,i know that hence why i said it comes with charges base and blink needs a talent to get
wow,not_removed,i didnt even notice i liked the old name rolled off the tongue nicely
wow,not_removed,dispersion isnt quite as strong any more it is only a damage reduction however i am of the opposite opinion of upralinen i like that we have cooldowns like this they dont trivialise mechanics in my opinion they are part of the fight a player has to plan and use his defensive cooldown accordingly throughout the fight to smooth out the fight there is a skillgap between players who can use defensive cooldowns properly a player who cannot will be stuck in normalheroic relying on their healers to carry them to victory we use these cooldowns in an optimal manner to maximise our ability to continue dpsing the bosses its actually a very weird scenario for shadow priests it may also be the reason he appears somewhat salty we use dispersion as dps cooldown less so with the recent swing of the nerfbuff bat and that it has been nerfed from to essentially we have to decide if it is worth using dispersion to avoid mechanics or use it with surrender to madness if we use it early we risk getting caught out halfway through and dying with our dps ending up mediocre dispersion halts the void form drain
wow,not_removed,well those are all cds and some are pretty long ones you just have it on your spacebar whenever you want and read my edit im not saying its op its lame
wow,not_removed,this is also what i said in reply to that but thats fine and those are not difficult mechanics those are the only mechanics
wow,not_removed,they are moving to a safe area faster or without the trouble other classes have when needed enrage timer is not an issue we need people alive
wow,not_removed,i read an interview that the engineering abilities being disabled was not intended but never fixed possibly a side effect of them disabling the legendary effects in pvp its stupid regardless that it has remained broken
wow,not_removed,it was confusing that you said double jump instead of infernal strike because that is actually another dh ability my apologies
wow,not_removed,off topic though all dark pact does is trivialize some damage from some mechanics not negate them
wow,not_removed,im holy so i dont have any kind of immunity blink teleport dash sprint unless i use a weak talent for it and i dont have reliable istant heals again a talent for self healing but you cannot have a sprint then or inmovement casting the only way to avoid bad stuff on the ground and survive is to run to a safe spot while keeping everyone else alive because even with those helps people still manages to die a lot im aware of all the cd other classes have and in all honesty being able to just fly over things some things ok everytime i want because the glide is not a defensive cd seems a bit silly
wow,not_removed,surely needing people alive means the enrage timer is an issue
wow,not_removed,being able to take a hit for free trivializes some of the simpler dont stand in fire mechanics but yeah not as good as invuln abilities
wow,not_removed,mind controls are a bigger issue than enrage
wow,not_removed,ah only mythic to max out traits ill get there by the end of next week
wow,not_removed,credits to who made the old spreadsheet that go me going this ones revamped will all new values and cleaned abit
wow,not_removed,thats at this doesnt take into account the gain in knowledge there was another sheet couple weeks ago that did and was much more realistic edit found it
wow,not_removed,its still over a million runs at ak its not possible to finish it
wow,not_removed,a bit more reachable than tho
wow,not_removed,while true its still not actually possible to attain before the next expansion comes out million runs minutes per run just being as generous as possible here is million minutes which is about years
wow,not_removed,uh im not sure what youre asking but yes you do have to use the feral weapon when specced feral
wow,not_removed,all artifacts are spec specific so yes youd either need fangs or something else from wod which would be terrible
wow,not_removed,thicc

wow,not_removed,͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
wow,not_removed,me ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
wow,not_removed,or kneel
wow,not_removed,i focused on the same thing i even thought to myself is this some awesome quest line im not aware of then i read the comments
wow,not_removed,to be fair considering this games graphical style its more a stylized representation of what the artists interpret as a female behind
wow,not_removed,͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
wow,not_removed,backstory ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
wow,not_removed,i dunno i think the plot is full of holes
wow,not_removed,rngsus
wow,not_removed,͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
wow,not_removed,i didnt have my glasses on and was trying to read the message but then i zoomed in and all i saw was booty and the message became clear
wow,not_removed,͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
wow,not_removed,but he has forsaken me this expansion
wow,not_removed,gotta wear the glasses to see the asses
wow,not_removed,woah thats alotta butts
wow,not_removed,i see this complaint a lot rngsus isnt all rngsus does is apply rng to our lives so when he rngs us he has done all he meant to do
wow,not_removed,have you considered lootcifer
wow,not_removed,ye he sounds like a good alternative
wow,not_removed,you dont need them anymore
wow,not_removed,these are literally useless now
wow,not_removed,please post if you end up redeeming them so people arent wasting time trying thanks
wow,not_removed,sorry just cleaning up and found them thanks for the update
wow,not_removed,sorry just cleaning up and found them thanks for the update
wow,not_removed,lol the trade chat what an easter egg
wow,not_removed,bags are a really solid newbie gift i remember someone gave me some when i started and it really made a significant difference nice one op
wow,not_removed,i wish i could make people as happy irl as i do to wow newbies when i give them keep fighting the good fight hopefully itll soften all us jaded vets up enough that the carefree spirit of the newbies will bring us into a new community golden age haha
wow,not_removed,my friends and i made a guild when hfc started to progress in our timezone didnt go as planned recently i got the gm post in that guild this seems like a great idea to change it into a new players hub gonna start farming some cloth
wow,not_removed,i kinda wanna stand around the newbie areas and offer free stuff but i also feel like id get overwhelmed andor mess it up somehow
wow,not_removed,i just want to bring attention to the average everyday messages that you see in trade chat i got the bitch pregnant next time wear a condom now thats what i pay a month for
wow,not_removed,people like this are awesome some random guys gave me a few k gold in trade chat i wasnt that new i was just nice or as a start in the game my guildlead gave me gold its a great feeling if you see some nice ppl on wow excuse my english
wow,not_removed,i am dusting off my rogue for a ganktastic time
wow,not_removed,great work op tonight i will also do this what better gold sink could there be than making someones day even if its just a few bags a friendly wave and offering any help you might be able to offer let this new community be brought up on hapiness and generosity rather than toxicity and hate
wow,not_removed,just hoping on the bandwagon here i have bags on horde draenor and ally hellfire both eu feel free to leave your battle tag here and ill get items too you
wow,not_removed,lmao i just saw that gotta love trade chat
wow,not_removed,right such a quality of life difference especially when youre new and unsure what to sell and what to keep
wow,not_removed,when you give wow newbies some bags you are making some real people just as happy irl
wow,not_removed,thats the spirit
wow,not_removed,lfr makes me question this tho
wow,not_removed,it dropped off the optional boss in gundrak that the tank insisted we kill i basically owe that guy my life now
wow,not_removed,for screenshots say it in the title or circle wtf im supposed to look at
wow,not_removed,yeah and aerith is right next to him
wow,not_removed,i dont get the reference
wow,not_removed,i hope theres a sephiroth wandering around out there
wow,not_removed,final fantasy vii reference to the flower lady seller aerisaerith and her bodyguard cloud
wow,not_removed,huln highmountain was actually identical brothers the histories omit that part because an army of siblings laying waste to all of one dreadlord isnt super impressive
wow,not_removed,harooo that and the massive clump of yellow swinging blades
wow,not_removed,i always cry when i see how the warlock trainers were lynched in soo
wow,not_removed,man seeing those warlock trainers i knew back in classic hanging from the ceiling hit me with some heavy feels
wow,not_removed,man this game has some heavy shit in it sometimes loktar ogar
wow,not_removed,this may be a lil offtopic but it kinda made me chuckle to see that after the horde and the alliance raided the city the only change to it was a lil memorial while deathwing just step on stormwind in the cinematic and left a crater in there for over years this is not whinning or anything i play horde but just an observation that made me laugh a bit when i saw this
wow,not_removed,many failthful orgrimmar citizens which is why i spit on garrosh every week during his intro speech in soo when he talks shit about warlocks
wow,not_removed,apart we will fall together we are horde dem feels
wow,not_removed,god damn why is the alliance so boring i get it we are an alliance of convenience and everybody wins but hell i want some conflict we will never get something as epic and memorable
wow,not_removed,itd be kind of cool to go into an uninstanced ragefire chasm and explore the remains of garroshs bunker
wow,not_removed,is this a nod to that mob in the cleft in siege that shot you with mind spike or we the spell was
wow,not_removed,in other words sorry we nailed your relatives to trees set them on fire and hung them upside down notallkorkron
wow,not_removed,garrosh did nothing wrong alliance lovers like thrall are the real problem in the horde alliance dogs you all deserve to die
wow,not_removed,neeru fireblade he almost lived to see the legions return
wow,not_removed,the aggressiveness of the korkron completely infuriated me to the point it was partly responsible for my switch to the alliance in wod seeing them harass the warlock trainers and even the goblin bankers and not being able to do something about it right then and there made me so angry the attitude that the korkron gave was a direct challenge and insult to your characters honor after serving the horde so faithfully for a decade this is the shit that you have to put up with fuck that
wow,not_removed,that filled me with so much goddamned rage
wow,not_removed,its pretty hard to really mess up a bunch of stones with metal spikes on them
wow,not_removed,garrosh did nothing wrong they practiced their foul demonic magic and paid the price
wow,not_removed,garrosh the true warchief of the horde loktar ogar
wow,not_removed,check out the park in sw in legion
wow,not_removed,convinience or not the alliance has grown to the point of all the seperate factionsraces look at each other like brothers varian went out of his way to end the civil war between the dwarves and managed to accept the worgen and have greymane stand at his side in the throne room of stormwind despite his beef with gilneas bailing on the alliance during the second war
wow,not_removed,read more of the books if you want awesome stories about the alliance they exist
wow,not_removed,its a nod to the entire siege cleft section really
wow,not_removed,i think wows graphics are decent but theres no arguing that many newer mmos look better so when i get any kind of emotional reaction out of this game its not because of some fancy cutscene its because of little things like this i only recently started playing after about a two year break and i was able to instantly remember how pissed off i was reading the exchange between the goblin bankers and the korkron
wow,not_removed,i think the part that horrified me most on my horde panda was the humans who attack you while screaming they have my babies because i quickly realized garrosh is forcing them to fight us by holding their children hostage what the holy fuck garrosh
wow,not_removed,and then people question the art of spikes on everything
wow,not_removed,now imma use old gods insteadyeah
wow,not_removed,make orgrimmar great again
wow,not_removed,yeah the renovations are to die for
wow,not_removed,thats kind of the point hey you guys get awesome stuff too in the supplementary materials is kind of a hollow win they dont even add simple stuff ingame half the time for example do you know how you find out that the alliance won a naval battle on the twilight highlands shores shattering the horde expedition to there you play through the horde highlands intro series there is zero mention of it to alliance players
wow,not_removed,our spikes are the whole reason that deathwing did not stop by to sit on our towers
wow,not_removed,looks like those people need more
wow,not_removed,i still love the shipwright or whatever you break out of the iron docks who when you grapple up somewhere talks about how great spikes are truly an ingenious bit of lampshading blizz
wow,not_removed,never seen someone accidently summoning an faceless one or old god while using voidshadark energy
wow,not_removed,i think the best part of garroshs orcjingoist horde is that the dark shaman basically use the same quote for their control of the elements as guldan did in rise of the horde for warlocks control of demons
wow,not_removed,i know thats your point im an alliance player too im just saying were not boring we just dont get the spotlight as much at least not in my opinion
wow,not_removed,not enough triflin gnomes i guess
wow,not_removed,im not actually the op but his argument can support us both alliance isnt as boring as it seems but if you dont read the books or even play horde you have no evidence of it in the game
wow,not_removed,i agree i mean there are bits and pieces here and there but its hard to piece it all together without the books though id say thats probably true for horde players as well i dont know how many times i ran black morass in bc but it never meant anything to me until i read the last guardian recently
wow,not_removed,that i would actually rate a little bit differently having played through warcraft and and reading the instruction manualsthat used to be a sort of required thing for games that instance felt entirely right to me even the infinite flight stuff while being a little vague was fleshed out elsewhere like the dragonblight series dealing with them that was no marcus jonathan or benedictus suddenly being evil sort of thing
wow,not_removed,if youre open to having the whole ui overhauled elvui is a beautiful one imo that lets you move everything
wow,not_removed,prefer to keep things fairly basic when it comes to wow i might try it out but i used a ui package in mop and there were just too many addons that i found unnecessary just want to be able to move a few bars
wow,not_removed,not sure if its the same for elvui i use tukui but i believe there are only two actual addons you need to install on that note i would definitely recommend either although elvui seems to more customizable
wow,not_removed,elvui is only one addon
wow,not_removed,does anyone know if they plan on lowering the amount of time for class hall upgrades this is great news for alts apart from my alt shaman who now has legendaries more than my main monk who has but cant wear them both for another month or so
wow,not_removed,retribution shield of vengeance creates a barrier of holy light that absorbs damage for sec when the barrier is consumed all damage absorbed is dealt as holy damage divided across all enemies within yds can be cast in shadowform paladin retribution spec instant min cooldown can be cast in shadowform i for one am looking forward to getting shadowform quesion remains if we also get surrender to mandess and wether it stacks with crusade
wow,not_removed,anyone else cant wait to lvl an alt to and then do all of the suramar questline that is going to be amazing at ak off the bat
wow,not_removed,just checked on ptr with my character i can only buy volumes iii for order hall resources the volumes are in a bulk and can be purchased all togather and are boa
wow,not_removed,now all we need is class hall research catchup
wow,not_removed,sweet now i have one less reason not to ditch my warlock
wow,not_removed,another thing i would like is to be able to send the hundreds of extra champion armaments i have to alts i just let them accumulate in my bank also to stop getting champion armaments missions
wow,not_removed,awesome but this shouldve been in the game from the start punishing people for making alt characters or switching main is one of the dumbest features in legion
wow,not_removed,you mean i can actually spend my resource on something
wow,not_removed,can we take a moment to acknowledge the exobar
wow,not_removed,does no one know what these will cost yet
wow,not_removed,to the people saying current system dont punish alts blizzard is just saying the opposite with this change i get the point of doing the class hall quests waiting weeks for upgrade your class hall more weeks for ak levels countless hours for your ap farming but im against doing it all over again for a new toon they should implement this kind of systems early into the expansion
wow,not_removed,will that be need to be bought with the ressources on the main character or can you buy it directly with your alt
wow,not_removed,do you spend the resources on the main or the alt the alts resources need to go towards legendary upgrade stuff while the main only really needs them for bonus rolls so its pretty important to know
wow,not_removed,dang is pretty high im excited to play on my alts on
wow,not_removed,i can only get so erect
wow,not_removed,im really happy they are adding more catch up mechanics my first three have had a pretty good progression with the time reduction mechanics so far but i really want to do the order hall campaign for every class will make it really easy when i finally finish them all to get the new ones boosted up quick
wow,not_removed,i imagine this threshold would continue to increase the further back they push the patch right
wow,not_removed,to rain on this parade just a little bit notice that there are separate ak research items there i suspect theyll be made available in tiers since even the people who hit the first week arent even at ak right now and you know a fit would be thrown if people who are just hitting have the same ak bonus as people that started working on it from the beginning
wow,not_removed,use will allow you to reach artifact knowledge level when used in conjunction with all unused artifact research documents not usable if the pupil has already researched or more artifact research documents what is meant by when used in conjunction with all unused artifact research documents
wow,not_removed,of my alts i only play and the rest i only touch them to pick up artifact knowledge or when i need to farm resources again because i need them to make more artifact knowledge
wow,not_removed,per character or account
wow,not_removed,•shadow nova rank after using shadowstrike or cheap shot you have a chance to or using shuriken storm while shadow dance is active you explode dealing shadow damage to all nearby enemiesthis effect may occur once every sec um so about shadow nova having the chance to in red does that mean sub rogues will not have the rng and itll proc always off shadowstrike and shuriken storm every time after seconds cd cause thats fucking huge buuuuut second cd for it is a little bit long
wow,not_removed,looks like alts are back on the menu boys
wow,not_removed,that will be great for all the fire mages that have to roll another class
wow,not_removed,it baffles me that some people in this thread still have no idea how this is supposed to in terms of catchup with months into the expansion
wow,not_removed,i dont even have yet o
wow,not_removed,wait you mean i still have to level from to manually fuck you and your alt unfriendly expansion blizzard
wow,not_removed,will you be able to send it to alts on different servers or am i sol
wow,not_removed,but isnt it kind of meaningless if youre artifact knowledge level is low on your alt sure you get a nice boost but in the end if youre only getting like or ap at time at level its going to be really annoying
wow,not_removed,still takes ages to get all the ap to level up my weapon to lvl its admittedly better than before but still shit it took me since the release of legion to even get my weapon to lvl and ilvl with purely focussing on one spec i put all in resto spec i cant even tank or dps in higher m or heroic raids with my main character although playing just him for the entire lifespan of this addon
wow,not_removed,how is this awesome you need to hinder your main character to boost ur alts wtf also is this even crossfaction realm if not wtf again
wow,not_removed,too bad it will either be a time gated or b rng based god help us if its both
wow,not_removed,yep i have characters with fully upgraded class hall but my alt monk still needs days and im refusing to farm order resource for more than a month waiting
wow,not_removed,i just got legion do you care to explain why you cant
wow,not_removed,id like to see the relic gating shortened on alts as well
wow,not_removed,i havent seen anything announced sounds like a good idea though
wow,not_removed,deus vult intensifies
wow,not_removed,shadowretpala inc prepare your memes
wow,not_removed,i knew there was a reason our hidden artifact appearance was the corrupted ashbringer deus vult
wow,not_removed,oh oh my god i want a shadowpaladin so bad right now if only there was a plate class thats the opposite of a paladin that dealt really good damage in raids kappa
wow,not_removed,im kinda doing this i just leveled my alt mage and all im doing is some world quest and some dungeons im yet to accept suramar questline from khadgar just waiting for those juicy ap coming to me whenever comes out
wow,not_removed,im starting a pally when i get home
wow,not_removed,i started suramar on my monk who is getting new ak every days or so just to get shalaran up and running for the fp so that i can do wqs for the emissary not having the portals everywhere really sucks though
wow,not_removed,still havent done the surmar quests on my main lol i have been waiting to get my ak up i am at like ak lvl or so i didnt want to waste the quest line my artifact is already ilvl just from wq
wow,not_removed,i looked through the mmoc link and didnt see anything about suramar stuff im probably either dumb or bad at reading or both can you elaborate i havent really started suramar on my druid as in ive done one or two quests my hunter will soon be too should i be doing something specifically for my alts
wow,not_removed,i got a dh to last week havent been touching him outside of emissary quests im doing this as soon as i get the ak research
wow,not_removed,how many ohr
wow,not_removed,oh so its per volume not each rank the volume grants were you able to buy being at
wow,not_removed,i dont know about that the only real progressiongating thing is the legendaries and it feels like youd have to get super lucky to acquire legendaries in a month unless has a continuation for the order hall progression that i havent heard about
wow,not_removed,ha thats like giving water wings to a man tied to an anchor the way i hear it
wow,not_removed,in my experience im assuming the code behind looks like something if playerhasallmaxlvlmaxilvlfollowers lvmissiontableaddrandomarmamentmission lvmissiontableaddrandomgoldmission
wow,not_removed,playing alts isnt really punished in legion playing your alts as substitute mains is thus switching mains is and thats imho not really a bad thing at all since it encourages players to stick with their main or at least invest a meaningful amount of time into these main alts playing alts normally as characters to play if there is nothing interesting to do on the main or if one simply wants a change of pace perspective works out just as fine as it always has people were still playing the alt unfriendly card in wod even though wod had rather little content to offer which made it easy to spend time on alts and a feature that made having a lot of alts no matter their power level very profitable any meaningful character specific progression system that could not be easily circumvented by having friends in high places has been called alt unfriendly in the past
wow,not_removed,i have alts none of them are below level ak
wow,not_removed,ehhh im personally okay with it we had the grindy session for the first few months of the expansion and now we can easily play catchup
wow,not_removed,that i very much prefer how it was but introducing that now is fine
wow,not_removed,punishing people for making alts isnt even the worst part punishing people for starting late into the expansion is depending on when hits i might as well buy the thing
wow,not_removed,think of it as rewarding people for having a main which has been my favorite thing about legion honestly
wow,not_removed,they should make it so once a character reaches they gain some half the amount of ap your main has instantly this will really help with being so behind in ap that combined with these knowledge scrolls will make alts a big thing again
wow,not_removed,by the time the patch comes out you will have it unless you didnt stat your research on release
wow,not_removed,resources here
wow,not_removed,prophet velen barkeep of the exobar not all who drink are drunk
wow,not_removed,resources last build at least
wow,not_removed,to the people saying current system dont punish alts blizzard is just saying the opposite with this change not necessarily since this change will primarily help two groups of players to catch up players who started later into the expansion players who switched their main these two groups need this change much much more than alts do making it easier to keep alts at a higher ak level is merely a nice side effect nice to have but totally unnecessary for normal alts great for those who play alts as additional mains though but these may have bigger fish to fry legendaries orderhall research
wow,not_removed,i started playing again two or three weeks before legion in a new server and i had only characters at when it launched and i really felt forced to stick to either of them because of ak despite not enjoying them all that much even the first weeks felt punishing to having an offspec ap doesnt come fast enough to have two weapons at decent levels
wow,not_removed,yeah some of the other redditors are getting annoyed that alts can be given so much but by the time they get to they would probably already be at ak or bit below plus its not like you get ap from this and your weapons power hits a plataue at artifact rank and you still have to gear
wow,not_removed,if your only goal is to do the order hall campaigns why do you need artifact knowledge for that
wow,not_removed,i would imagine it means the server tracks how many times youve done artifact research and gotten documents if you havent used all of your documents you cant use the new item to bump you up to its a preventive measure to prevent stockpiling of ar notes before the patch goes live
wow,not_removed,so it looks like a consumable per character so you can use your main account which is probably flush with order resources buy up this consumable and send it to your newly birthed alt if you have a greater litter of alt babies you would have to buy for each
wow,not_removed,neither does anybody max is at the moment
wow,not_removed,boa means yes
wow,not_removed,still takes ages to get all the ap to level up my weapon to lvl its supposed to
wow,not_removed,it took me since the release of legion to even get my weapon to lvl and ilvl with purely focussing on one spec do you not play much granted weapon ilvl is more random im at but its just lucky titanforge drops but im at level holy artifact weapon with some in the other specs i dont think i play all that much and tend to mostly log in to finish emissary quest and for raids i dont grind mythic like my friends just finish my then relax
wow,not_removed,you should try leveling a fresh again sometime and take a look at what the artifact power items give you with research this is not still shit by any quantifiable metric aside from low iq
wow,not_removed,idiot
wow,not_removed,does this catch up mechanic really nullify the hard work you have done really does all that ak just go away please think before you post
wow,not_removed,no because you earn this by having reached artifact knowledge milestones on your main you dont just buy it on a new character it must be bought on an existing character thats already unlocked a minimum artifact knowledge level so if it went live right now you couldnt buy your way to ak immediately on your main youd have to unlock ak on your main the normal way then using your main you could buy tomes of ak to send to your alt up to level it nullifies nothing it doesnt negate the time you spent instead it rewards it people dont get this for free its intended a a catchup mechanic for alts of people with progressed mains
wow,not_removed,boa items are only limited by your account not faction or realm
wow,not_removed,you need to hinder your main character to boost ur alts wtf maybe if blizzard just played your character for you it would make you happy how do you suggest you catch your alts ak up to your main without affecting your main in any way
wow,not_removed,i cant believe that mailing gold to my alt makes me lose gold
wow,not_removed,you need to hinder your main character to boost ur alts how are you hindering your main character is the order hall resources to buy the books really that much of a hindrance to your main its a single world quest to unlock ak levels on an alt what were you doing with those resources anyway
wow,not_removed,isnt the entire point of it to skip the timegate involved for a fresh i think its safe to assume the only cost will be order resources per rank with no time restrictions or rng involved
wow,not_removed,blood of sargeras resources helps a lot on alts
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,now we need the next tier set to look like fucking horus
wow,not_removed,tier warrior is probably the closest thing
wow,not_removed,i always considered death knights the evil paladins but ive heard negative thing about unholy
wow,not_removed,ive got my pally with his corrupted ashbringer skin wearing some dk lookalike armor for mog matches the color pretty well though and kind of just gives him the dark paladin look
wow,not_removed,frost dk is about on par with ret pally in tov i personally view dk and pally as opposites
wow,not_removed,yea but at the same time once your mana cap goes up you can just hit cap and plow through the teleporter and let line activations doing that on my priest currently
wow,not_removed,good thing for you at launch you had to grind to at least friendly with nightfallen just to unlock world quests think it was friendly at least may have been honored
wow,not_removed,suramar questline give a crap ton of artifact power so if you hold off in them til your knowledge goes up youll be getting more bang for your buck i think one of the final ones gave me like at of i remember correctly
wow,not_removed,well the whole point of this upcoming artifact knowledge buying thing is to make legion more alt friendly right so you wouldnt get punished for using an alt my warrior i made about weeks ago is extremely behind compared to my main that i got to at the start of legion i have to wait another month before i can equip my second one it just seems like they should include class research catchup as well if they are trying to make it more alt friendly
wow,not_removed,punishing people for switching mains is a terrible game design people switch mains for lots of reasons other than im bored a few examples just from my guild we needed a better tank healer so someone switched to holy pally we had too many melee so someone was maining a warlock despite not liking them through new recruits and people dropping our balance switched to being too range heavy so they were able to switch to their dk who they had always previously mained someone couldnt adapt to the new disc priest a class they have mained for years so they switched to shaman people should not be punished because they make play choices to help their guild in a game where most of the end game is heavily group oriented
wow,not_removed,its the best thing for arena nothing keeps things balanced as much as people not being able to switch to fotm every time in just a day
wow,not_removed,the problem comes with major tuning patches like where they are completely breaking certain specs or doing nothing for the ones in dire need so people want to switch because it feels shitty doing the best you can and only being able to keep up with people that are average
wow,not_removed,any meaningful character specific progression system that could not be easily circumvented by having friends in high places has been called alt unfriendly in the past artifact knowledge is not meaningful though its literally just a timer your character must exist at level for x weeks before it is allowed to be on par it doesnt even involve playing the game save for clicking a couple of buttons in your class hall every third day im okay with it taking a while to catch up im not okay with the main source of that delay being an arbitrarily imposed timer that the player can do absolutely nothing to speed up
wow,not_removed,yeah but the problem is the class balance team fucked up horrendously this expac for many many specs and classes and is even worse as many currently viable specs are being kneecapped instead of simply buffing the other specs to be up to their level my guild is currently gearing out alts as future mains in for this reason including a mm hunter and a spriest
wow,not_removed,yeah every day you dont have a alt you are just falling further behind it makes it so if you even dream about wanting to play an alt you better level it to just in case to have it afk next to the artifact knowledge npc
wow,not_removed,not all of us had the time to level alts to that quickly and keep our main up as well
wow,not_removed,and i have an alt that is nearly ilvl but only level ak as a result my artifact progress is garbage compared to my gearing im liking this alt enough to consider making it my main but with being so far behind ak it doesnt seem worth the trouble
wow,not_removed,it might not mean anything beyond this point but if you decided that you wanted to play a different character a month in youd be very far behind for a long time my old main is at ak while my new one is at if you play competitively or in progress raids catching up to the meta will take time sure if you keep the character you made from the beginning as a main youre not gonna care too much about your alts but if you didnt you basically got put behind for no real reason you gotta remember that while you are catching up to everyone else theyre still getting more ap than you
wow,not_removed,that means all of your alts were leveled at least days ago this if is for alts leveled more recent and is a great change
wow,not_removed,congrats on nolifing alts up at the very beginning then
wow,not_removed,i have one alt he has level ak there should never have been a system put in place to punish latecomers or alts in the first place
wow,not_removed,c congratulations this is just cringey that youre getting upvotes about prioritizing your wow time to level characters and maintain resources every days to keep going theres so many other variables i want to ask about your raiding progression m progression and ap on each character please know that your concept of playing wow makes me want to vomit im glad blizzard doesnt even agree with you that everything is fine
wow,not_removed,see i dont agree with that sure mains are encouraged but to say alts arent punished right now is just plain untrue sure if you leveled your alts a day or after your mains well then yea theyre not punished but if youre like me and got bored of your main after about days played at and decided to roll something else its pretty rough i wont touch the alts ive leveled right now except for the occasional emissary quests because being so far behind on ak is so punishing the effort you put in now on new is not worth the reward
wow,not_removed,tomato tomato
wow,not_removed,so my wanting to try a healing class in legion but not having a healer at isnt being punished i cant even start my ak research yet i cant just level an off spec healing weapon because neither my warlock nor my dk my only two have a healing spec i am being punished because i chose to level two classes who both dont have a heal spec should i have leveled a pally or a monk instead of a dk at the start maybe i should have it would certainly help me now
wow,not_removed,people who want to play multiple characters already have to split their time between them why create more artificial differences based on when the character hit
wow,not_removed,rewarding one and not the other is effectively the same as punishing the other there is literally no difference other than wording
wow,not_removed,if your playtime is limited youre already being punished playing an alt by splitting your ap gains between characters player a who only plays his main is going to be ahead of player b playing a main and an alt in their time spent on the game
wow,not_removed,when does come out btw
wow,not_removed,do you do every single world quest everyday lol
wow,not_removed,pic please if legit thats insane
wow,not_removed,wow thats it no astronomical price for no reason blizzardyou need to slow down with your amazing changes this expansion
wow,not_removed,well shit i might as well start working on my char then
wow,not_removed,is it based off your highest ak and its per rank up or group of ak
wow,not_removed,players who switched their main as one of these people until your new main gets reasonably caught up to your former main the new main is still an alt maybe it isnt as bad for people who either switched mains early or leveled their altnew main early and got ak rolling early but i have limited play time i decided weeks ago i wanted to switch mains but it wasnt until our last raid night sunday that my dk was high enough in akap to actually raid until i could take my dk into raid it was my alt
wow,not_removed,honestly there will always be someone unhappy many people have been complaining about how hard it is to have alts while others think it should be hard to have alts i think it is great to allow players to have some options in the toons they play even with this ak boost main toons should still be a decent bit ahead of alts
wow,not_removed,i believe he is talking in terms of catch up mechanics not just ak essentially hes hopeful that they will reduce times for missionsupgrades so he can complete the stories in a shorter amount of time
wow,not_removed,ah of course ahem i knew that
wow,not_removed,on average hours a day i stopped doing emissary qeusts that second i got exalted on a faction from m a day and our weekly raid clears theres not much ap i can gather so its only atm going through that grind again for an off spec or an alt please kill me i stand to what i say wow got really really altunfriendly with legion as much as i enjoy the contentwith my main character on his main spec
wow,not_removed,please cite the whole context not just parts i clearly said right before its admittedly better than before
wow,not_removed,i can see them increasing the resource cost
wow,not_removed,doesnt make days goes faster though
wow,not_removed,where can i exchange them
wow,not_removed,that starlight rose opportunity cost tho i need my doomsdaystash of flaska and deadly grace i feel naked without it
wow,not_removed,i have to say i much prefer the way a wc looks in compared to just because of how united everything is
wow,not_removed,any armor set that is true to the look is insta transmog for me
wow,not_removed,woooosh
wow,not_removed,ill probably level as prot but in all likelyhood if i ever raid on it it would be as ret because my guild has exactly ret pally on our raid team
wow,not_removed,yeah that would have sucked the only thing i think i am missing out on is i heard there is a dungeon that gets unlocked the arcway i think i dont know i have never done or seen that one
wow,not_removed,oh okay i was already doing this lol i thought something else changed but the buying ak or whatever would make this a bit easier
wow,not_removed,i think its also a way for new players to not feel so helplessly underpowered
wow,not_removed,my point is how likely is it that you get legendaries on an alt before finishing the research
wow,not_removed,punishing people for switching mains is a terrible game design thats hugely debatable having a character specific progression system besides gear is something very good especially one that feels meaningful because of the required time investment and the reward it offers in general it is not bad game design to reward encourage that players stick to the classes they originally chose especially in such a long term oriented genre like mmorpgs where content usually last quite a while is it really that bad if catching up takes a month or two i think not others will surely disagree you list a few valid reasons for switching to another class or spec while a quick switch might be more urgent in some of these cases than in others is it really that bad if the switch takes time people should not be punished because they make play choices to help their guild in a game where most of the end game is heavily group oriented is trading a short term disadvantage for a long term gain really that bad it is not like the game makes the switch impossible it just takes a while and if such a meaningful change helps the group in the long term shouldnt it be up to the groip to support it and make the transition as smooth as possible its a group oriented game after all and isnt that what communities are all about supporting each other
wow,not_removed,the problem comes with major tuning patches like if we were talking major gameplay overhauls then this would be a problem if it is just minor gameplay adjustments and number tuning then no not at all at least not as long as most specs are as closely balanced as they have been this expansion most specs are within of the median specs with just outliers currently shadow affliction at the top survival at the bottom these are laughable differences while a patch like will hopefully shuffle the rankings a little it is very unlikely that things will look vastly unbalanced post so people want to switch because it feels shitty doing the best you can and only being able to keep up with people that are average thats a gross exaggeration yes doing average dps does not feel great i understand that but if someone needs to play one of the top specs to do better than people that are average then the skill difference might not be as huge as one might think
wow,not_removed,except other than nightfallen the other reps are functionally useless past honored for your alts with the exception of maybe one you can use the rank recipes for which arent required
wow,not_removed,why does rep matter i do think legion is the most alt unfriendly wow has ever been due to artifacts and legendaries but why rep i have two alts and have no clue where their rep is and dont care because i dont need to my main will get flying to share with alts and arcwaycos are unlocked accountwide now
wow,not_removed,legion reps are not important to alt gearing at all
wow,not_removed,i think they just got in over their heads with redesigning so many specs when some of them really didnt need a redesign combined with the fact that they now have to balance artifacts and their traits for each spec and class and its just a monumental amount of tuning and tweaking and number crunching they have to do on top of that they also need to make each spec feel cool and fun and all that class fantasy stuff its a monumental undertaking the likes of which their class balance team has probably never seen before
wow,not_removed,my main fire mage afk by the ak vendor right now rip lil buddy
wow,not_removed,no if you have an alt why do you need the same ak as peoples mains right now your an alt for a reason you arnt gonna be at the same level as your main right as you hit
wow,not_removed,can somebody explain me this if you are not levrling your weapon since day you will have to keep up with everyone else is that how it works with the artifact weapon im at without legion so i dont know how this works
wow,not_removed,not true at all the system is set up to catch you up my druid who i leveled weeks after launch is within of max ak and my mage who i leveled weeks after launch is within of max ak
wow,not_removed,meh i get to play probably hours a week i have two characters at ilvl with traits on their main specs and between and ak i think hunter is almost now just started leveling him a few days ago its really fast to level in legion i just do daily stuff on my two characters and if i have time ill do some quests on my hunter if you want to have alts its seriously not a big deal its no more difficult in legion than it was in wod or mop if anything its easier with the ak system since youre getting a bis weapon for basically doing world quests and daily dungeonspvp for ap as the expansion goes on longer than a few months more people will have more ak and ap levels will be even easier to get
wow,not_removed,yeah i leveled a character from weeks ago because my guild needed me to play a different class im at roughly the same item level as everyone theyre average ilvl is around while im at but with my artifact is laughably underleveled everyone is getting closer and closer to their trait and im still trying to get my golden trait
wow,not_removed,its impossible to be
wow,not_removed,they are still getting more ap but they also need more ap it doesnt scale linearly
wow,not_removed,well im not saying it is a bad change but people complaining that they cant suddenly change their mains after months of playing on their old main is just silly wow has always been gated behind a time mechanic
wow,not_removed,game has been out for three months it takes hours to reach lol
wow,not_removed,then playing a video game isnt for you
wow,not_removed,how are you being punished why do you think you deserve ak right as you hit
wow,not_removed,its not a punishment someone simply played more so heshe has higher ak and more total ap collected
wow,not_removed,people act like being time gated behind ak is a new thing remember when you were literally months behind for your legendary item something you could not speed upfarm for in pas expas
wow,not_removed,call me cringey yet you stutter when typing ccool if my concept of playing makes you vomit then you need to take a look around not everyone only plays hours a day before bed like you do my raiding progression and m are both high of my toon both have high artifact weapons because i know if i want to stop playing my main class then i can instantly jump to my alt and have no down time
wow,not_removed,not to mention having to do the entire suramar lineagain
wow,not_removed,cant please everyone
wow,not_removed,unknown but not soon as it seems over weeks
wow,not_removed,you should be fine i dont think well see for another weeks anyway a bunch of specs are doing really poor with the changes and i cant imagine theyd roll them out in that state im getting ak around midnight tonight so i think its realistic for most people that got in the first week should get it
wow,not_removed,i would imagine its per rank just like researching it the long way i dont think they have said anything about restrictions and if its based off your highest ak only thing i can remember blizzard actually saying was that youll be able to buy ak up to which apparently has now changed to
wow,not_removed,that system bites though when you already know youre switching mains time spent on your old main feels like time wasted i know im switching to dps but i dont want to feel like im wasting time by playing my holy pally
wow,not_removed,i dont raid with my guild really so its not a comparison i did the same thing though rolled with my rogue on release got him up to reasonable akapilvl and enjoyed the content for a bit then put him aside other than emissary chests and weekly quests to level my druid once the druid was i waited a while to get ak up to i think really arbitrarily picked a number and just did low m mythics and world quests for gear and daily bonusesweekly quests all in all probably took weeks or so of playing to catch up to my rogue other than ak of course i think weeks or so in now both characters are traits and ilvl theres certainly not the instant gratification of reaching and catching up it takes a time investment to do it even now if my rogue was more like my druid would have weeks to catch up i think the system works pretty well you can still reasonably gear an alt and maintain their artifact pretty decently having more than one alt unless youre playing probably hours a day would be a struggle to keep up with emissary chests weekly quests and lockouts the artifact system is a burden compared to not having it however farming a bis weapon for an alt is more difficult in previous expansions than farming ap at least with ap you can pretty much solo farm it and if youre willing to pug or have a good m group get a good bonus that way comparing to garrisons faction farming which overall wasnt really required in wod to legion with the artifact it feels like less of a chore to maintain multiple characters e and as dumb as it sounds the carrot on a stick of having a legendary show up in a chest or upgrades through forged or better itemization makes world quests not feel like youre only farming reputation garrisons just werent engaging enough for me to care doing world quests are basically dailies but theyre at least in different places once you do them for a while you see the same quests but at least they arent the same quests over and over again
wow,not_removed,lets take this to the extreme shall we whats the point of having charactes around if we abandon all long term character based progression anyways just let us change the class et al upon logging in yesterday a worgen warlock today a bloodelf paladin tomorrow a troll druid or a human warrior who knows the reputation system is fine as it is would it be nice if they had some more meaningful rewards sure woudl it be nice if there were additional ways to earn reputation of course it the reputation system so horrible it needs any changes nope not really
wow,not_removed,yeah thatd be nice
wow,not_removed,every day he doesnt start days grind is another day the days stays days even then its not even a grind you log on go up to an npc click a button and come back after its done
wow,not_removed,blood vendor in dalaran
wow,not_removed,its an amazing trade for people with alts they have no real interest in farming order resources on but a main that collects tons of blood of sargeras with no other use such as my alchemist main
wow,not_removed,jewelcrafters dont even get anything from trading bloods as you said felslate is easier to get than trading for bloods
wow,not_removed,i cant find any logic in this
wow,not_removed,i havent even been able to pull it off in and ive tried a few times in since and cant do it again i must have had a bit of luck on that run
wow,not_removed,towards the end of the questline youll get quests to go in there theyre mythic only currently but once youve attuned to them on one character it unlocks it for your whole account i do believe i heard a dev interview where they said there will be heroic versions of those soon edit court of stars and arcway
wow,not_removed,its going to be stupid in a good way with i am getting some decent amounts even though my next trait cost i can just imagine a fresh weapon at just getting done so quick that it would feel amazing
wow,not_removed,well i did and i have one sitting in my bags waiting im not impatient or anything but realistically you shouldnt have to wait an extra month to equip on your alt
wow,not_removed,days played at just completed it the wear last week still only here
wow,not_removed,is it really that bad if the switch takes time if the switch is actively making enjoy the game less yes it is i get that this is an mmo and requires long term investment but it is still a game that is played to have fun if a mechanic is making a sizable portion of the audience have less fun it is a bad mechanic in a game is trading a short term disadvantage for a long term gain really that bad it is not like the game makes the switch impossible it just takes a while and if such a meaningful change helps the group in the long term shouldnt it be up to the groip to support it and make the transition as smooth as possible its a group oriented game after all and isnt that what communities are all about supporting each other i guess it depends on your definition of short term i understand that in the grand scheme of wow and legion a month or two is short term for an individual doing something for fun it is a while though it took me a month to get my dk up to raid viability she is still way behind my warlock in ilvl weapon traits and ak so while i can finally main the dk im still behind after a month of playing catch up and yes a group should and mine did help me but a lot of this stuff is time gated ak and therefore weapon traits are a time gated mechanic my group can help me all they want but unlocking weapon traits at low ak levels becomes ridiculous at a certain disparity so yes they can funnel you gear i gained ilvl to doing one dungeon last night because all the plate wearers funneled me gear doesnt change that until i get more ak the ap tokens im earning are barely making a dent in my current weapon point
wow,not_removed,no but some specs are losing a shitload of damage and some specs that need more damage arent getting them affliction is an example survival another if you see an affliction or survival below a shadow priest that is a fucking miracle they are even within of a shadow priest
wow,not_removed,some of them were very cool redesigns but others like marksmanship hunter rip chimera shot and fun class mechanics were unwanted unneeded and actually detract from fun and class fantasy
wow,not_removed,same with my mage maybe someday i will play it
wow,not_removed,yes but the reasoning behind wanting to have high ak is so when they do a patch and break a class you could level an alt and get it to ak and you can quickly bring him up to a competative level you could be ilvl right when you hit if you want to spend the gold even with only spending a small amount you could be within a few hours with loot sharing but being at doesnt mean anything if you have a low level artifact weapon
wow,not_removed,okay but why shouldnt you be able to switch mains by just playing more on an alt if i have hours on my main and on my alt i should be able to play another hours on my alt and overtake my main this is only possible if my alt isnt a newly made character
wow,not_removed,for the average player it doesnt matter for someone whose interested in progression you fell behind period if someone in your guild only plays one toon they will always have more aptraits than you and more importantly the person levelingmaintaining multiple alts will be lagging behind everyone else when it comes to getting their oh golden trait this was never a catch up mechanic and you did indeed get punished for leveling multiple alts no matter how you look at it yes some people didnt care because it wasnt an extreme punishment but you were punished non the less for someone like me i wasnt able to start leveling an alt until later in the expansion just because of that feeling of being punished and i still only have alt at right now with ak i actually have a career raid hours a week and a social life i wasnt an altaholic in the past but there was never any mechanic in past expansions that made me feel like i was losing out by spending time on an alts on top of it that feeling grows exponentially the longer you wait to get that alt to the further you feel behind so you keep putting it off more and more its not some game breaking thing and at the end of the day i will live but to pretend that there was absolutely no negative aspects with this system is just absurd its ok to be critical of blizzard and obviously they understand they fucked up hence why they will be fixing it
wow,not_removed,you should be at the same level of ak youre punished enough by not having the same amount of time to farm ap
wow,not_removed,i dont want the same ak as another persons main i just want an ak level where it doesnt feel like getting an ap item is just useless
wow,not_removed,why not youre still going to be behind on artifact power since you havent been able to grind it for months why do alts need to be put even further behind its not like they dont have to pay the order resources either
wow,not_removed,i want a relatively close ap level to my now main stop tossing the word alt around like a character can never become a main you know like any second in perpetuity until you stop playing
wow,not_removed,i switched mains pretty far into the expansion and at lvl ak i am at traits and severely underpowered compared to everyone just because of my ap i play just as well but with no catch up mechanic theres seemingly no reason to keep climbing im in a state of limbo waiting to get more ak so content is actually worth doing
wow,not_removed,because it really makes you feel like youre wasting your time when youre on an alt and you do a wq for that would give your main
wow,not_removed,its not the weapon its the artifact knowledge once you hit level your class hall lets you place work orders for artifact knowledge at resources each it takes days to complete and it makes it so you gain more artifact power in every token you get from any source so basically you want high artifact knowledge to get the most artifact power
wow,not_removed,how is it untrue if you just stated that the alt you leveled later is behind the druid while the artifact knowledge catch up helps the longer you wait the longer its going to take to get to its full potential will fix that though i leveled a paladin who hit two weeks ago had i leveled it and just sat it next to the ak npc id be in much better shape with the weapon traits
wow,not_removed,cool and my hunter who i leveled last week is at ak while my main is at my guild desperately needs ranged dps but you cant level an alt and get him geared and do good dps its another massive hurdle but it comes with a massive time gate
wow,not_removed,this is true for now the further we get into legion the more difficult it will be to get caught up on ak without a system like what they are implementing in months into legion and decide you want a shaman that would suck without a system like this
wow,not_removed,its slightly longer than half if you were only or levels behind the difference between what it is an half would basically be irrelevant but if youre levels behind it adds up
wow,not_removed,its still days to catch up to where were are now currently and by that time your older character will be at ak for a few weeks it currently stinks to have your artifact level be the one bottleneck to alts you can shoot up ilevel with friends help but without a leveled weapon youre still gimped i get that alts are not supposed to be as good as mains but right now its not even close
wow,not_removed,sorry typo
wow,not_removed,its closer than you think after points is is is is while ak goes up exponentially
wow,not_removed,well im not saying it is a bad change but people complaining that they cant suddenly change their mains after months of playing on their old main is just silly wow has always been gated behind a time mechanic gotcha whats a good example of a catch up time gated besides the legendaries quest lines from the last expansions from what i remember its mostly been effort based in the last if i wanted to farm out gear get carried in raids for gear or buy myself boes until im the power level of current raiders i could if i had the time and resources edit not arguing with you im just curious
wow,not_removed,while his comment was dramatic he has somewhat of a point you used to hit and then gear for power enchant and gem just like anyone can now you hit and you are up against people with full artifact traits which is a huge gap you cant even farm artifact power without having artifact knowledge if i spent all day farming artifact power with my id get nowhere
wow,not_removed,i deserve it because there is no reason for there to be a hard timewall on being able to participate in end game content my main who i levelled as soon as legion started has my alt who i have now put an equal amount of effort into has ak no my bad the only difference between them is one was levelled earlier why does merely creating the character earlier not playing it more mean your alts deserve
wow,not_removed,yes it is its not about playing more if someone levelled an alt when legion started and logged in every ten days to upgrade ak theyd have right now while someone who has recently picked up wow got to level a week ago and has been playing hours a day since would have it punishes people for coming in late or making an alt if you levelled an alt months ago youll have far higher ak than if you levelled an alt now despite the two taking the same amount of time and effort
wow,not_removed,thank you for showing your playstyle isnt a representation of even a small fraction of the current player base maybe before you make comments to someone who is actually a representation of the majority you just delete the comment next time the meatloaf is ready by the way
wow,not_removed,why do you have to do the suramar questline again i have done the quests up to unlocking court and arcway on my first and havent done any other questing on my other
wow,not_removed,save that until the patch gives us the free ak you will get absolutely insane ap i recently did it on my dh which i have ak on compared to below when i did it on my main and it is crazy how fast you get ap
wow,not_removed,impossible i started research a week after release have had down time and am ak
wow,not_removed,at last my mains resources are good for something
wow,not_removed,oh i completely agree i was emphasizing that point by pointing out how long it actually takes to switch a main ive felt like i was wasting time playing my warlock for a month now but my dk didnt have enough points in their weapon to be raid viable at the level my guild is raiding at and i didnt have powerful enough relics by far the most difficult piece of gear to get in legion to get my weapon to a respectable ilvl i finally got my second gold dragon and rngeesus smiled upon me and bestowed unto me two titanforged wq relics and now finally i can main my dk and just use my warlock to unlock rep gated things since im still far from caught up on rep on my dk
wow,not_removed,even now if my rogue was more like my druid would have weeks to catch up this is mostly the issue im dealing with personally my warlock is at the max ak and ilvl i had to have gold traits and ilvl before i could bring my dk into our main raid im semiokay with it being difficult to keep multiple characters up on all your dailies ap etc what i dont like is how punishing switching your main is even at i was tied for the lowest ilvl dps in my guilds raid with the other being a mage of another guildie switching mains the ak is really the choke point though which is why i like the system they are implementing and dont understand why people are against it
wow,not_removed,didnt they already nerf the mission times
wow,not_removed,👌 👀 👌 good shit 💯 ✔
wow,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but if you grind them and dont use them just keep in your inventory could you buy the level item then use the ones youve collected to gain a bunch more immediately or are they unique
wow,not_removed,which is just outside the blacksmith and mining shop
wow,not_removed,bloods on alchemy are make the trinket with bloodsand if you have rank you can double or triple or more proc each trinket obliterums
wow,not_removed,i think hes saying that he doesnt want to spend blood on resources when he can spend them on herbs
wow,not_removed,musta just got lucky then i basically spammed mythics and mythic once i got still think if theyre going to do one type of catchup they should do the other as well
wow,not_removed,pve asidethe weapon traits in pvp when having just one gold trait worth of talents vs mains with practically full talents is pretty big for all the work blizzard did to equal pvp the weapon traits have become to divider
wow,not_removed,item level ak with two legendaries and i honestly cant be bothered playing it for the simple reason im still so so far behind in ak and im over a month off using my second legendary and there is not a damn thing i can do to speed up this ridiculous time gate theyve put in place
wow,not_removed,well you need a bit more than gold to get a full crafted gear it costs bloods of sargeras to use obliterums on a piece
wow,not_removed,right cough hunter cough
wow,not_removed,because they are you alt for a reason
wow,not_removed,and you will get a close one when the patch comes out the game has only been out for months and you want a catch up mechanic already
wow,not_removed,i did as well and while i got lucky on loot quickly in days of wqs and timewalking i didnt notice that much of a gap in akap if i can recommend one thing its bench the guy for weeks just logging in to hand in ap and then hit up suramar while pvping in randoms the rewards are pretty awesome for both and it goes fairly quickly and also levels your honor talents theres no beam me up scotty catchup but this has worked well for me thus far
wow,not_removed,if youre only at traits you really havent put much effort into that character at all even at just getting your disguise for suramar should get you nearly to that point
wow,not_removed,however all this ap missing translates into maybe missed traits in your weapon and reaching the last trait week later still behind but not really that big a deal
wow,not_removed,except youre not really that gimped getting all of your traits or for most classes the important traits that are beyond the super cheap traits is trivial youre making it sound like your alt isnt able to do pugs or nonprogression raidingpvp which is not the case at all
wow,not_removed,but it is not the same and at that level people are gain healingdamage not gaming changing
wow,not_removed,wait what was your question p your first sentence
wow,not_removed,youd actually level your weapon faster than us because we had to wait days for each ak unlike you you are also up against other who are gonna complain about gear too
wow,not_removed,so whats the difference between removing ak timewalls and just removing leveling in general the game is a monthly subscription mmo where people have spent the last years screaming for continual content and progression some catchup mechanics sure maybe something like ak heirlooms but to just get everything instantly is a terrible idea and not the purpose of the game
wow,not_removed,lol your alt that alt that you put in equal amoount of effort but only has ak
wow,not_removed,but in this case catch up mechanic is in motion alt will need days for ak research to complete and main days so in longer perspective an alt will catch up ak the only downside is that you will not have same ak level on alt as on your main day one you hit but is it bad that way i dont think so you still had to spend time to level at the begining of expansion spend time logging gathering order resources to keep researches going i know that some of you would like have everything instantly but ak is not a problem at all the bigger problem are legendaries and i but most people wont get their bis legendaries before they reach max ak level time gating mechanic was in wow from the start so because someone start late or is a new player should we allow himher let clear and be eligible for emerald nightmare raid loot more than once a week according to your logic timegating raid lockouts is also unfair because someone who plays from the begining of xpac could clear en raid more times and get more loots
wow,not_removed,and your attitude is the reason we have lfr
wow,not_removed,to unlock world quests in those zones or advance the story for pathfinder achievement
wow,not_removed,yep wont go to suramar until this happens
wow,not_removed,yeah but its just having to do it again and again is so annoying
wow,not_removed,hey its me your alt
wow,not_removed,i dont get it either your case is probably unfortunately the less numerically common casuals like myself its not as big of a deal and the new system is just a bonus i just wish that we could boa bank ap that would be amazing im assuming theres probably some technical details that limit this depending on how the artifact ap system was implemented but man wouldnt it be nice to be able to do that even if you were just running m on your main to bank that sweet ap for your new toon it would be nice to drop a fat stack of ap in the mail to catchup your freshly leveled alt or hell even farming ap across all your characters through wqs etc and funneling it all to one character
wow,not_removed,wish you good loot and stable connect
wow,not_removed,m e t a e t a
wow,not_removed,if you mean the new items on ptr that jump you from to ak then no when you use the new items they consume all ak scrolls you may have saved up somewhere and jump you to the level the new items say they take you too to prevent this
wow,not_removed,of what use is gold when i have alts that i want artifact power on
wow,not_removed,if you dont need it for game time gold is useless unless youre super into pets or we
wow,not_removed,the problem is thus i have prospected over times and only gotten about blue gems and about green gems
wow,not_removed,then he can start playing the game to either go farm herbs or farm resources
wow,not_removed,the disparity between the top and bottom dps specs on heroic en is roughly this is much larger than your allegedly nonexistent this holds true for mythic en as well with massive differences in dps between classes
wow,not_removed,you are basing this stuff on sims go look at xavius or ursoc and show me a survival hunter doing nearly as much as a priest or rogue how many survival hunters have you seen this expansion i have seen one that seriously mained it since launch and their damage was complete garbage logs right now which is realistic damage numbers by real people not perfect simulations has affliction dps behind shadow with bm and survival close behind
wow,not_removed,yeah no sims are way more than difference between top and bottom just like actual logs in every difficulty show
wow,not_removed,i dont think that matters pvp is ridiculously at its worst state it has ever been
wow,not_removed,what does that even mean
wow,not_removed,thats not an argument
wow,not_removed,im at revered with suramar the ak rollercoaster is really powerful at lvl im netting for an average quest for a big quest im still tanking heroic raid lvl and gearing to has been relatively easy but a real catch up for ak is absolutely needed for when everyone is starting to hit
wow,not_removed,i disagree the current form encourages people who want to have alts later to level and park them at for now rather than reward playing them in any meaningful way when it comes to ap blizzard obviously now sees it as a pointless time constraint because theyre changing it for the better alts are still behind in terms of gear and ap progression but those can be overcome if you put in enough effort inside the game i dont get why people are against this change at all
wow,not_removed,i was responding to someone who was talking about the time to research even if its faster being time gated over days to get to a point where youre still days behind isnt a good design which is why theyre changing it speaking from my ww monks perspective who hit max level weeks ago and got carried to ilevel the optimal path doesnt get the first golden trait until level and its a very noticeable drain on damage it feels terrible to put any effort into the the monks ap farm because i could spend half the time week later to get the same affect which will make player not pursue playing and enjoying alts at all i could farm every ap source with most of my free time and not make much progress on my weapon at all waiting is the optimal strategy id keep typing but i realize you probably wont change your opinion
wow,not_removed,uh the dmg boost is more game changing than half the artifact traits
wow,not_removed,its not about deserving anything or that it takes comparatively less time than it did months ago the problem is that theres now a hard timewall when playing an alt in any other iteration of wow you could hit max and begin gearing immediately nothing was stopping you from going from fresh max level to raidready in a single dayweekend given the effort in legion you hit and start your ak research and logout for a few weeks or you can just run heroics and world quests for awhile knowing all that progress will be wiped away with a single norm en raid and all the ap youre accruing is mostly pointless because a week from now youll be getting more which is still barely anything when everyone is already on tov ilvl at even if you hit max level and put in all the effort to gear out and catch up with someones main youre still useless compared to someone that hit max level a month ago its essentially created a gap where you can only compete with people if you hit at the same time so in the end you can have two players that have put in similar amounts of effort and have similar skill levels but the one that hit first will always be better how is that okay
wow,not_removed,the more you play the more experience you gain ak is gated entirely behind time it doesnt matter how many hours you play
wow,not_removed,ak is a useless mechanic that should never have existed the amount of ap you receive increasing is fine but it should not be time gated
wow,not_removed,my alt who i have now put an equal amount of effort into has ak no my bad reading comprehension isnt really your thing huh
wow,not_removed,but in this case catch up mechanic is in motion alt will need days for ak research to complete and main days so in longer perspective an alt will catch up ak not true and also not important theres no system in place that will ever allow you to truly catch up all you can do is get close and that will not only take a very long time no matter how much you play it also might not even be enough not being able to get your ak up to par means you also cant get your character strong enough to be viable for say mythic nighthold in time i know that some of you would like have everything instantly really weird strawman no one is saying they want anything instantly you dont seem to understand the point youre arguing against i want my alts to be able to be as advanced as my main provided i spend an equal amount of time playing on them i want to be able to play hours on my alt and not be far behind my main that i also played hours on this is how it is right now and there is no reason for it to be this way time gating mechanic was in wow from the start not really relevant because just because its been in the game for a while doesnt mean its a good thing its in the game and its unimportant because barely anyone even has time to clear raids on heroic and mythic multiple times a week more importantly youre ignoring how the ak time gating makes you fall behind in other areas too one of the reasons why its harder to get your alts geared up is exactly because no one wants someone with traits in their mythic raid according to your logic timegating raid lockouts is also unfair because someone who plays from the begining of xpac could clear en raid more times and get more loots thats like saying according to your logic fat people should just never eat and then they would die which is even worse than being fat no its okay to be against excessive timegating without being against any and all timegating its fine for there to be some timegating in the game but if theres additional timegating which sets you even further behind the already existing timegate of raid lockouts its perfectly legitimate to take issue with that beyond that if you clear en for the first time in november you still have enough time to get basically a full gear set by the time nighthold comes around you might not get there as fast as other people but at least youll get there on time for the next content patch
wow,not_removed,with days vs days it takes forever to get close i dont even play the character much and i was caught up on gear and still far far behind on ak
wow,not_removed,you should be behind because of skill and gear not some arbitrary time limit
wow,not_removed,please tell me why someone who is fresh to the game just hit would need ak or higher to get weapon traits
wow,not_removed,you use such extreme example for no reason nobody is asking for mythic loot and max ak level all people want is to start at reasonable ak level so that you can still grind ap yes you will still have to do it you will already be behind on legendaries and gear why introduce third point for no reason alt isnt going to perform as well as main for over a month or even more even with the new ak catch up thats more than reasonable waiting months just to start playing an alt at a reasonable rate is absurd i leveled my priest weeks ago and im only gonna do emissary quests and get boosted in lvl each week until i catch up in a couple of months its so demoralising to get shitty ap for the same quests that give my main over it might be fun to some masochists not fun for me
wow,not_removed,im confident i achieved aotc before you did are you really trolling through my posts
wow,not_removed,honestly if i can buy eventually ak i dont care about banks my it for alts at ak youll get your early traits so fast it will be ridiculous
wow,not_removed,what if you have a work order or two you havent picked up yet
wow,not_removed,buy a raw gem for sell a finished gem for spend the profit after ah cut on fel slate and turn felblood to felblood
wow,not_removed,what hes actually saying is he wants to have a backup supply of them stored in bloods just incase things go awry and he doesnt have time to farm any before he needs them
wow,not_removed,ive literally not figuratively read this precise phrase in every goddamn patch since tbc pvp is always the worst right now and blizzard always has the worst balance right now also you and everyone you know will unsubscribe because of it thatll teach em
wow,not_removed,only good pvp class is frost dk who one shot everyone
wow,not_removed,of all statistics are made up on the spot right but comparing raw ap numbers isnt very useful since acquisition is exponential yet costs are too you start out a month later you end up a week and a half behind the whole point about ap is that you never entirely catch up but that differences should be minor the final trait throws a wrench here though before the first character gets their final trait the difference is the worst couple of traits in the artifact after the second character gets their final trait the difference is a few ranks of the final trait again the problem here is the extreme relevance of the point ill concede this is a big problem albeit only for the peroid where one character has it and the other doesnt
wow,not_removed,nah i get what youre saying and you dont have to change my opinion to have a discussion about this to me i look at an alt as being different youre working on your main or a main and focusing most of your time and energy into that character having an alt makes sense too because once you do all of the things you can do on your main theres not much left to do for progression being gated by ak and i just did this too does feel bad i got my druid to level cap and geared up through wqs and mythics to and then kinda just let him sit to build up ak youre right not having ak after having ak on your main makes farming ap feel really stupid i honestly dont know how i feel about it on one hand it would be nice to be able to do something on your main to effectively bring up your ak to some level which is happening as i understand in the next patch since youve already played the waiting game on one character however i still stand by my point that not having your artifact maxed out or even completely optimal doesnt make your alt useless sure progression content isnt going to be competitive until you catch up you can still do a good amount of content while getting ap through pve and pvp while you wait for ak to build up im pretty confident that well see an overhaul of the ak system again later on in the expansion i think right now blizzard is purposefully slowing all of it down so people dont just blaze through character progression while that makes sense in some way it does kinda suck for alts
wow,not_removed,trust me if youre levels behind someone you wont notice the more samage they do thats like someone using an augment rune and the other person not
wow,not_removed,not sure why you feel the need to insult me
wow,not_removed,but ap is farmable we all did it since launch its not that bad and traits arent a crutch for all specs
wow,not_removed,it was designed to slow the process down deliberately just like having heroicmythic lockouts so you dont hit max levelilevel in weeks without sleeping and then complain that there is no content
wow,not_removed,and heshe will get it but not as soon as heshe hit catchup mechanic is in motion so the ak gap between someone who started earlier will be smaller every few days research time vs research time sorry but a fresh to the game does not have to jump instantly into mythic raid progression or dungeons traits that you got during leveling is more then enough to do normalheroic dungeons even normal en raid
wow,not_removed,exactly this for a lot of classes you really need of the golden traits at least to not be a complete drag on the group youre still not in great shape but every bit helps but youre geared before you can even get that far
wow,not_removed,so you brag about having aotc before me yet say my playstyle isnt the same as yours
wow,not_removed,just sayin there are wiser ways to spend em again if you have no use for gold and really there is no use for gold in this game at max level anymore being able to send resources to alts you dont feel like farming the resources with just so they can run missions from the app and queue ak is a great thing
wow,not_removed,prospecting is just so bad why is it so bad
wow,not_removed,dont you need to be revered with court of farondis in order to get the enchant i didnt think my main could buy them for my alts ie bop not boe i am slowly getting my alts rep up but it takes time when all you can do is wqs
wow,not_removed,thats because tbc and wotlk have been objectively the best and no patch has gotten close notice how no one is asking for cata or mop pvp back
wow,not_removed,ive never really had problem with pvp but legions newly introduced stat templates are top level bullshit and made me do zero pvp even though i love to but ill have to get prestige for artifact skin so feelsbadman
wow,not_removed,now that were down strength long gone are the days of one shotting anyone
wow,not_removed,feral is good frost dks affliction locks strong enhance is fine lots of other melee are still playable i think the only class that might be struggling is rogue they have sub in a few comps but than that they get outshined
wow,not_removed,them along with holy paladins and monks
wow,not_removed,monk is dominating right now tbh
wow,not_removed,of all statistics are made up on the spot right i never claimed to have any statistics what i provided were anecdotal sample numbers you should learn the difference before trying to berate others but comparing raw ap numbers isnt very useful since acquisition is exponential yet costs are too you start out a month later you end up a week and a half behind the whole point about ap is that you never entirely catch up but that differences should be minor youre completely ignoring that players spend a different amount of time if a mechanic requires you to play multiple times as much as another person to catch up to them completely in power thats the opposite of a catchup mechanic when in reality mmos need catchup mechanics if they want to sustain longterm mechanics like the current ak that make it impossible to entirely catch up are very common in eg chinese mmos where its standard to merge servers starting a week after release because the player base is shrinking so rapidly you cannot expect players to start playing your game when they know theyll never be able to catch up to other players even if they play significantly more the final trait throws a wrench here though before the first character gets their final trait the difference is the worst couple of traits in the artifact after the second character gets their final trait the difference is a few ranks of the final trait again the problem here is the extreme relevance of the point ill concede this is a big problem albeit only for the peroid where one character has it and the other doesnt which happens to be during the current progress race for players who started just after raid release players who played from beginning could reasonably get their trait just before or at the same time as tov mythic release whereas players who didnt are pretty much stuck with traits now unless they can spend enough time to progress raid and farm ap a few hours a day at the same time
wow,not_removed,whats your point here the point after is just as impactful as the points before if the two points before are game changing then the points after are also game changing
wow,not_removed,dont be a douchebag then
wow,not_removed,what is the point in saying this there are hours in a day past a certain point a new character will need more than hours to farm in day the amount of ap someone else can farm in less than say hours somethings got to give you cannot keep up with people who have higher ak especially if you dont have far more time than they do
wow,not_removed,uh why would you farm it at launch at low ak it was hundreds of ap difference for many many times more effort youd have to spam heroicsmythic for being maybe a trait ahead i swapped to my dk and hit months into the xpac and my artifacts are the people spending hours and hours farming ap at the beginning were treading water for no reason
wow,not_removed,except that exact same thing could have been achieved by making the gains from artifact power increased by a certain for all characters that increases week by week all artifact knowledge does is heavily penalise those who came late or levelled an alt recently
wow,not_removed,thats not really true you can catch up exponentially quicker in gear if you play a lot and then you just sit on your ass waiting for ak speaking from experience how long it takes to learn varies wildly between classes depending on their complexity
wow,not_removed,a few weeks i hit on my shaman days ago and my pickup is ready in days hours thats just shy of weeks for with the catchup my shaman is also already and its weapon is i had to check to make sure there was even a form of catchup in place this feels absurdly slow for an alt
wow,not_removed,you clearly have no idea im weeks into my alt and hes only while most people are sitting at
wow,not_removed,i hit on a druid got geared to through wqs heroics crafted gear and lfr in under a week that ilvl puts me ready for regular mythics but id be a drag on a group since im not even at my first gold trait yet that is what people are talking about ive basically caught up to baselevel mythics in gear but cant do anything to speed up my ap gain
wow,not_removed,traits that you got during leveling is more then enough to do normalheroic dungeons even normal en raid i agree but when everyones already moved on well past that content you strive to meet them you work hard in instancesworld questslfr and get your ilvl to a decent level you enchant that awesome new gear and gem it to push as much as you can you farm for artifact power all day and come out witha few bars my issue isnt so much that its a grind i can do that my issue is that artifact power requirements go up with the mind that you have artifact knowledge to counter it this was fine when the game was released almost months later its just a downer for alts for me and my alts cant come soon enough
wow,not_removed,no you just have no concept of what casual means anymore
wow,not_removed,objectively the best pvp was broken beyond repair reckbombs unkillable slsl warlocks etc take off your rosetinted glasses ive read about pvp is in its worst state now in tbc and wotlk a lot
wow,not_removed,does zero pvp complains about how bad pvp is
wow,not_removed,meanwhile ive enjoyed pvp more now and on more characters at once than ever before and i did a metric fuckton of it back in bc and wotlk
wow,not_removed,frost was one shotting at one point in legion how likewhat was the rotation and did they use abilitys that were moved or pruned i feel like they just run into a group and aoe shit
wow,not_removed,considering the point is a flat increase and generally the last traits taken are the less influential your statement is most likely incorrect
wow,not_removed,you must not know what the traits do lol
wow,not_removed,so with the new compendiums how do you feel
wow,not_removed,my main had ak when i started my alt my main has ak and my alt has ak the difference was lvl so its so my alt was days behind already it took me days to get to ak and it took my alt days to reach ak and its still behind it takes dayswork order for alt and dayswork order for main so if my math skills are right i need days to completely catch up with my main yep thats a lot of time ak catch up scrolls are more than welcome now fingers crossed for halved order hall upgrades time if youve got atleast fully upgraded order hall already
wow,not_removed,yep one of my alts has caught up to my main in gear and i did it the slow way at first and relied on wqs so i didnt gear as fast as i could and im still way behind on ak
wow,not_removed,i said a few weeks not less than a couple of weeks but like i said that is your alt you have no reason to need to have him just as good as your main only days later when your main has been playing for months
wow,not_removed,so what are you trying to insinuate by saying you have aotc before i did are you trying to say you are casual are you trying to call me bad you said my playstyle is not of that of the majority of players so i am just confused
wow,not_removed,since its bad why would i pvp lmao i know its difficult for some ppl to think before they talk
wow,not_removed,hes not wrong ive got over arenas played and i think that having to adhere to blizzards intended pvp stat distribution is garbage we need haste to get casts off and widen burst windows who would have thought it
wow,not_removed,new players if youre looking for people to play with feel free to post the same info or your desired factionrealm if you dont have one
wow,not_removed,wipes tear my little thrall server growing up i play there too im not really raiding or doing competitive pvp at the moment with the expansion so close but i would also be open to play with some new people or help new players my tag is
wow,not_removed,haha i love the fact that people are downvoting just because of the subject good work bro
wow,not_removed,was worth a shot p ill probably try again after the movie comes out
wow,not_removed,fury warrior or havoc dh for melee shadow priest for ranged melee have it made in the shade this xpac so if you like seeing your name on top stay melee
wow,not_removed,frost dk is king in nh
wow,not_removed,not completely accurate but good start
wow,not_removed,between fury warriors frost dk havoc dh ret pallies and windwalkers are your top picks right now as they excel in single target and aoe fights range can generally do better in fights where aoe is more spread out ie boomies but none of the range classes can beat an equally gearedskilled melee in st focused fights as evident on krosus and trilliax so youll be hard pressed to try and do so rogues are definitely top of their game for st focused fights but does fall slightly behind other melee if it involves aoe and since you prefer to be more rounded go with one of the above options as theyre very close to each other and will come down to your preferred playstyle skill level
wow,not_removed,frost dk is probably the strongest dps in this tier even more so with the right legendaries
wow,not_removed,that moment when a brewi make more dps in a dungeonraid than the rest kappa
wow,not_removed,yea melee seems way better than ranged this expansion thanks for the reply
wow,not_removed,my first thought was wow i cant believe shadow priest are on that seems low and windwalker monks are what the fuck then i changed it from to percentile and suddenly shadow priests are and windwalker monks drop to i personally think that a good way to figure out the good dps classes is to look at the world first kill videos and see whats doing the best youre going to see fury warrior frost dk ret pally shadow priest dh and rogues
wow,not_removed,yea logs give some idea but some bosses like skorpyron and aoe fights give some classes inflated dps for a general overview thats why im asking for a more personal opinion thanks for the help thought
wow,not_removed,and good across the different encounter types
wow,not_removed,melee does have it pretty good this xpac on top of there now being a few more melee specs than ranged but because of that keep in mind that ranged may be in greater demand i think that nerfing caster mobility also contributed to the decline in casters as well in addition to completely removing one hunter ranged spec messing with the mm spec pretty heavily really putting locks in a bad place at the start of the xpac
wow,not_removed,your not gonna see frost dks in the world first kills not that they arent good but they arent prevalent in the top guilds atm
wow,not_removed,dont believe skorpyron is included
wow,not_removed,go to each fight change the percentiles and the weeks included youll get a pretty good idea but to answer your question melee are dominating ranged does ok on some fights especially in heroic and early mythic progression but as your group tightens up adds die quicker and you start to fall rogues warriors frost dks and demon hunters are dominating shadow priests are doing pretty good for range as well as frost mages for single target hunters and fire mages are pretty solid too but not blowing anything out of the water
wow,not_removed,opinions wont trump data you can look at each boss individually and see what sort of op youre looking for be it mostly single target or aoe warriors seem to be doing pretty highly on all fights
wow,not_removed,i think thats the most important thing to note about frost its a really good spec overall in nighthold but usually not the best for any one fight you wont any of the top guilds stacking it in their kills due to the sheer number of geared specs they have access to but its probably the most worthwhile melee spec to play for someone that isnt planning on swapping classes around much
wow,not_removed,while at the same time streamlining melee its like a different game playing warrior and demon hunter it actually reminds me of blade and soul and in l that game ranged can move and cast and its fantastic
wow,not_removed,out of the top m guldan kills only method didnt have a frost dk in their comp not saying that guilds are stacking frost dks but they definitely have their uses in raid
wow,not_removed,exorsus had a frost dk on guldan world first only beat by their insane fury warriors its doing great dps at the minute
wow,not_removed,wrath barely beats out mop for me mostly because i didnt have a guild during mop i think the mop content is highly underrated but so far legion is giving me wrath vibes like you said
wow,not_removed,i think it is a little early to call it the best expansion however i will say it was one of the smoothest launches ive seen i read the illidan book and that got me excited something i havent been as excited about since the arthas book i am definitely enjoying the expansion so far and i havent had this much fun leveling and immersing myself in the various areas in a very long time
wow,not_removed,i am in wait and see right now i think there is little doubt for me that will be better than mists and warlords but ultimately warlords failed for me because there wasnt shit to do the first few hours of warlords i was like d d d from all of the old school name dropping and beyond the dark portal throwback stuff i do have a base under lights hope chapel and the ashbringer now thoughreally regretting doing all of the argent tournament grind on my dk
wow,not_removed,they even have wrath of the lich king the dungeon which is nice im pretty certain that the two years was spent on legion and they just didnt want to push anything back to wod because legion was turning out to be so epic already
wow,not_removed,it feels a little to me like they have pulled a little from every expansion previously or from what i have seen so far which i am all for offers more variety
wow,not_removed,stormheim especially reminds me of wrath feels a lot like northrend the expansion overall feels like a best of for a lot of wow content over the years
wow,not_removed,wrath was designed to kind of tie up the plot threads left from warcraft as a result they introduced a lot of lore intensive elements like the vrykul and a lot of the big lore figures with legion theyve realized that theyve gone off the rails a bit with the story but they have a perfectly fine story already available so theyre going back and sorting out the lore which means tying up old plot threads and referencing the same kind of figures as wotlk
wow,not_removed,for me i honestly believe it is the best expansion yes beating wrath borean tundra where i started in northrend wasnt particularly interesting to me though wrath picked up after that for legion its whambam awesome straight off the bat
wow,not_removed,nah its not a shitty recycled raid that made me unsub till cata world first mythic guldan would have happened already if it was wrath too
wow,not_removed,i am with you though i think that the antagonist role is now also more central similar to how the lich king was present in most quest lines in all zones and the entire expansion built towards his fall
wow,not_removed,i think he meant that blizz considered wrath to be the best expansion and theyre trying to recapture wrath because of it
wow,not_removed,yeah i was about to say the same thing its the only zone ive finished so far but it was giving my serious wrath flashbacks its a good thing ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
wow,not_removed,yes i started in stormheim hoping for howling fjord and was not disappointed
wow,not_removed,woh some people are still salty over naxxramas really closing in on years buddy
wow,not_removed,so you missed out on ulduar and icc because of a recycled raid your loss pretty much
wow,not_removed,which i never understood naxx was fun and i never got to see it in vanilla most people dodnt
wow,not_removed,of players didnt get past the abominations in the first room p
wow,not_removed,dude just wait till next xpac and you get
wow,not_removed,not worth it to wait is going to take months
wow,not_removed,i would do it now there are a lot of world quests that are unlocked by doing suramar quest chains and many of those give blue ak rewards i would bet it would be a net loss over the months you wait to get ak
wow,not_removed,ak suramar does true just ask yourself do you need traits right now do you have some heroicmythic raid tomorrow then do it you dont then hold on until you need it
wow,not_removed,meh ive already done suramar on my old main recently rerolled and havent done suramar on this toon so was just wondering if anyone has a source for exact numbers
wow,not_removed,good luck netflix and spotify are your friends its a long grind but well worth the effort imo
wow,not_removed,current lowest is like kills more and im done with pirates and onto my last boxes for ravenholdt
wow,not_removed,for future reference you should probably put faction and euus in thread titles for these sorts of things good luck i ground mine out a while ago now i just need to actually finish my lockbox grind
wow,not_removed,finally done this farm now onto boxes d need more d
wow,not_removed,anyone
wow,not_removed,definitely boyfriend has some netflix on and music d
wow,not_removed,crushridge pvp us we can serverinvite though if youre on my battletag
wow,not_removed,ah i meant to but forgot thanks for the reminder congrats how many more lockboxes
wow,not_removed,still doing it
wow,not_removed,according to wowjujus rep calc though i need to get exalted for my own peace of mind
wow,not_removed,sorry for not replying sooner i got really tired and fell asleep
wow,not_removed,agreed haha were one in the same
wow,not_removed,hahah no worries buddyro just let me know if you ever need help
wow,not_removed,it doesnt say anything you lived through all the other boss fights doesnt mean you were doing the fight correctly just mean that healers had enough mana to cover your mistakes or you could be doing terrible dps that were being carried most of the time i was the dps to die and had higher dps then of the other that died before me wut if you die later then obviously you would have more damage done than people who die earlier and again this doesnt mean anything some classes dont do much damage until the last phase some has crazy burst at the start
wow,not_removed,it is a little weird to sit people on heroic but my guild also sits trials on progression usually so that is not too unusual
wow,not_removed,if you died on botanist it doesnt sound like you know the mechanics for the fight no offense since youre new and theyre still progressing they probably just didnt want to carry you how early into the fight did you die also post up any logs if you have em
wow,not_removed,tbh any guild that is currently progressing on heroic bot is such a low tier casual guild that their leadership is bound to be at least a little moronic ie they benched someone after one wipe on heroic no it is not normal but being this far behind in progression isnt normal either
wow,not_removed,i am a little confused as to how the rate in which they progress makes any difference to this what so ever just because you may be past this point does not mean other guilds are keep in mind the op is new to raiding is she expected to get into a mythic server first guild as the first raid guild they get into or is everyone not at the same progression level as you a low tier casual shit like this is why this reddit gets a bad name
wow,not_removed,who says theyre behind maybe theyre just now starting their progression or maybe they dont raid very often
wow,not_removed,holy shit ive never seen the full art for cons i always thought it was just an owlkin burning in the holy fire
wow,not_removed,shitpost
wow,not_removed,stop with these

wow,not_removed,not just this sub they tend to be the cancer of the internet running until the joke is truly dead
wow,not_removed,i second asmongold he is funny an does alot of videos around patched and content he has the same mentality as most of the wow community and alot of the things he says you will see people say in game ie he always says never stop going big dick and alot of other one liners if your wanted to see some funny streamsvideos watch his or sodapopping funny guys

wow,not_removed,for what op is asking about i agree that preacher is a great choice lots of types of videos and thoughtful discussion
wow,not_removed,hello fellow ballers
wow,not_removed,preach gaming for sure he recently made two different series of videos one for aspiring tanks and one for healers he goes through picking which class what is expected of your role and exactly how to do it he pugs dungeons with fresh characters and walks you through the process from beginning to end hes fun to watch knows his stuff and knows how to share his knowledge with you in a way that should be easy to get a quick grasp
wow,not_removed,people new to his channel have to keep in mind though that his videos are centered around his audience and not for the general wow community a result from that is that preach rarely does controversial videos and the last ones beingas far as i can remember a short minute segment in a minute video about nostalrius and the legendary dilemma before that that is something i love about the videos though i know controversial subjects are important but some channelslike asmongold just go overboard with it and take any rumor etc to get views which will then spark idiotic ideas in the community just take a look at the mmochampion thread about the distilled titan essence weve got no confirmation whatsoever and people are losing their collective mind over a rumor so for op i recommend you watch preachs latest videothe one about patch so you can make yourself a picture of him
wow,not_removed,i have to agree with the nobbel recommendation he is very well versed in the lore of warcraft and makes great lore videos
wow,not_removed,i wholly disagree they take forever to explain the simplest of mechanics and the important bits of information are lost in their banter to each their own but i prefer to stay away from fatboss i dont know any other channels by name off the top of my head but almost anything else on youtube is better than fatboss in my opinion at least
wow,not_removed,he is great good relaxing voice to listen too when he is doing an hour video
wow,not_removed,i like proper birds stuff but shes hardly ahead of my progression most of the time
wow,not_removed,how to raid a warlock you can find an sl warlock outside if or orgrimmar this is the place where most sl warlocks hang out to initiate combat you should approach the warlock and talk to him he will say something about how nerfed warlocks were and how they could not kill anyone in previous patches and how they became godlike while mages are now water dispensers after you talk to him click duel to start the fight phase one you should position yourself as shown in this image the warlock will begin the fight without a pet because he will feel too overpowered to use a pet against you and should position the warlock so that his back will face the tank farther away from the if door it is advisable for them to have at least shadow resistance and one of them should also have fire resist minimum this is explained later greater shadow protection pots are also a good commodity as are whipper root tubers and stamina potions from the quest in blasted lands the melee dps group shown as yellow in the pic should stay behind the warlock near the tank farther away from the gate this is done because they will need to retreat behind the tank and bandage from time to time bandage spot is shown on the pic the rest of the raid should position as shown in the picture it is important for the raid to have about shadow resistance which will help sustain the damage keep in mind you will need at least dispellers for each debuff type otherwise you will wipe pretty soon during phase the warlock will perform a series of attacks shadow bolt a bolt of shadow is launched every seconds to the tank that has aggro causing to shadow damage depending on resistance a shadow bolt will crit between and damage again depending on the target resistance this is where should come into play if a shadowbolt crits he will have a debuff that will increase shadow damage by a zillion times this is when should taunt the warlock to prevent from dying will then do the same thing once another shadowbolt crits curse of doom every minute the warlock will cast cod on a random raid member this member should move outside the raid and unload full dps since he will die within the minute shadowburn the warlock will cast shadowburn every time he changes target if one of the raid members gets aggro he will suffer shadowburn and instantly die it is important not to over dps or members will die one after another fear the warlock will cast fear on a random raid member every few seconds you should provide everyone with fear ward if you have it and dispel fear asap especially on mts and healers phase is relatively easy and will last until the warlock has life this can take between and minutes depending on your equipment phase two when the warlock reaches life he will instacast a felhunter and soul link it this is when the fight becomes harder note you cannot kill the warlock while the felhunter is alive if you try to the warlock will say that its not his time yet and will use a healthstone which will probably render the fight impossible in phase three a few moments before phase two the raid should move as shown in the pic note and which are tanking the felhunter should stay at least yards away from the warlock phase two is all about killing the felhunter the felhunter cannot be damaged by magic as it has very high magic resistance also during phase two you should not magic debuff the pet or the warlock otherwise the felhunter will remove the debuff and heal himself should stay on the warlock with a few healers while the melee dps group will take down the felhunter while the magic dps group focuses on the warlock during this phase the warlock will receive next to no damage as he is soul linked to the pet during phase two the warlock will have a new attack at his disposal hellfire every seconds the warlock will cast hellfire and hit anyone within yards for an incredible amount of fire damage every dps class standing near the warlock should retreat as shown in the picture and bandage as soon as he casts hellfire only the mt with fire resistance should remain near the warlock this is done because if the warlock finds no one within melee range during hellfire he will summon an infernal and wipe the raid when the felhunter is dead phase three begins phase three phase three will begin as soon as the felhunter is dead notes the warlock should be at around health now if hes any higher than that youll prolly not be able to take him down before you wipe also if you have more than dead members by now you will probably wipe as you cant do enough dps during phase three the warlock will use all his arsenal to kill you curse of shadowelementsagony every seconds the warlock will cast a random curse on the entire raid these debuffs should be removed as soon as possible if coe or cos are not removed after seconds the warlock will cast immolateshadowbolt on the member killing him howl of terror the warlock will randomly cast hot hitting all the melees around him you need to be quick and dispel fear on the mts otherwise they will lose aggro death coil the most imbalanced spell in the warlocks arsenal this spell will be cast on a random raid member killing him and will heal the warlock ctraidassist will warn you when the warlock is about to cast deathcoil and all healers should hide behind the tank if more than healers are killed the mts will not be able to sustain damage and die wiping the raid note in this pic an arrow points to the outoflos spot for healers this is where you should hide when the warlock is about to deathcoil phase four when the warlock is at life he does an emote saying imba warlock performs one last service for blizzard he will then cast curse of doom on the entire raid this means you need to kill him within one minute or you will wipe you should have at least dps classes still alive here otherwise you wont be able to kill him in time if you manage to kill him within the minute congratulations you just killed the hardest boss currently in world of warcraft
wow,not_removed,normally i would say we just have to suck it up until the next expansion actually gets here but its become absurd at this point how broken they are
wow,not_removed,for the millionth time the game is no longer balanced around level
wow,not_removed,i can kill most on my feral druid it does suck matching a good lock though
wow,not_removed,as of as i understand the fight the warlocks abilities are now narrowed behind a randomly selected spec choice at the beginning of the fight similarly to terrongor in auchindon if the warlock goes affliction both demo and afflic have higher chances of casting than destro how should fear be handled in the case of a caster especially healer with fear and unstable affliction which if dispelled silences for secs also if the warlock spawns in goldshire instead of durotar is the bs or inn better to break los inn has a narrower window good for avoiding damage but limited to responding to tank movement while bs has the opposite
wow,not_removed,but were still level
wow,not_removed,no buts
wow,not_removed,i have yet to not have fun on my brewmaster not a very common or wellliked opinion but its an opinion i love it im never not pushing buttons i cant tell you much more than that
wow,not_removed,i cant speak for tanking or healing but man im still in love with windwalking monks a crazy powerful artifact ability massive dps potential plus bareknuckle asskicking its the monk ive always wanted
wow,not_removed,for ranged dps i think frost is fun albeit having lots of buttons to press for melee dps i think windwalker monk is fun not only there are lots of buttons to press the specs mastery rewards you for it for tank i think blood dk is fun because im a scrub and having your attack that deals damage and heals you is suitable for me for healing i think discipline priest is fun again because im a scrub and healing someone by unleashing holy wrath on your enemies is funny to me
wow,not_removed,veng dhassa roguedestro lockbm hunterunholy dk dk main
wow,not_removed,blackout combo with haste makes that gameplay so fluid and fun buffing every ability i got a brewmaster to and is my main and now im trying to level every tank to get a feel for them brm is still my favourite so far and contrary to general opinion the simplest
wow,not_removed,ive seen so many good things about monks im leveling mine up to its been awesome so far loving bm and ww havent tried the new mistweaver yet
wow,not_removed,agree completely with this
wow,not_removed,the latest one seems to be working fine
wow,not_removed,no because you havent said whats wrong
wow,not_removed,it doenst give any error i have no cleu where to search already reinstalled curse and the addons the wow client is also fresh
wow,not_removed,look at your collections tab on that character i think by default it only shows you heirlooms that your character can use so you may need to expand the menu to see all heirlooms
wow,not_removed,i dont think assassination really works like that because of how combo points function and youre mostly keeping up dot timingsclipping surge of toxins with envenom youre better off just learning without a wa because it wont be the same static rotation over and over again
wow,not_removed,look up aneurysms wa it wont be a rotation helper type wa but it has all the dot timers and stuff which should help i use that plus a tellmewhen i configured myself to show a few things
wow,not_removed,theres a nice wa that shows your nightstalker buffed ruptures in a different colour so you know not to refresh them before they expire however i cannot for the life of me remember who made it it also has garrote kingsbane envenom buff surge vendetta potion etc
wow,not_removed,not sure about wa it might exist but if you can manage with using tmw chesers has a lot of nice tmw profiles rotation helper on his profile httpchesderweeblycom once you are confortable enough you could witch to a simple weakaura
wow,not_removed,aethys made and addon which is linked to the current standard apl for simc httpswowcurseforgecomprojectsaethysrotation the apl for assassination is getting improved but not bad you need some comfort in the spec when using it however else it will seem very fast paced its more useful to debug apls but i guess it could be used as a learning tool if one is quick minded
wow,not_removed,i think you should learn assa rotation without a wa telling you whats next the rotation in itself isnt hard but you have to get used to refreshing sot at last tick and also energy pooling takes time to get used to and to know when to do it if youre having problems with dpsrotation go to httproguedpsguidecom that site has basic and advanced assa guides and also some tips and tricks in nighthold
wow,not_removed,classes are the simplest theyve ever been in the history of wow why does everyone need an addon all of a sudden to play their classes
wow,not_removed,wa is over rated just use tell me when its easy as shit to set up
wow,not_removed,true enough assassination gameplay involves a lot of pooling decisionmaking and choosing to or not to bet on a proc any rotation helper would be far from what should be done i think more than for other classesspecs
wow,not_removed,tell me when is a crutch for baddies just use weakauras as its superior customizable and is the standard for everyone who isnt poop so by your logic wa tmw dbm big wigs gtfo heal bot decursive and all other helpful addons are a crutch which makes us all baddies including you wa its terrible on your cpu i mean its a hog the more you load into it the more cpu it takes a lot more tons more try using tellmewhen while this is also somewhat of a cpu user it uses about half that of weak auras it doesnt have all the extra bells and whistles like weak auras has but it does the same thing and is a lot easier to use and set up
wow,not_removed,both are crutches for baddies you need addons to tell you when to press the buttons in your rotation
wow,not_removed,youre a baddie unless you play with no addons no ui and with your monitor off
wow,not_removed,nope just crutch addons that tell you what buttons to press and when
wow,not_removed,does pandaren language really translate to om nom nom d
wow,not_removed,thats just amazing thanks for that
wow,not_removed,how did you get there its blocked off for me
wow,not_removed,anyone else a little salty because blizzard took om nom nom away from feral druids renamed it blood in the water while saying we dont want to use pop culture references in integral parts of the game ie not easter eggs and then do this
wow,not_removed,whats the helmet youre wearing for xmog purposes
wow,not_removed,nom nom
wow,not_removed,at least you had the courtesy to change the title slightly
wow,not_removed,yes both spoken and written
wow,not_removed,we pandaren are a simple and hungry people
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,its a text block you would never see unless you did some sneaky jumping and bugged your way in if thats integral to you
wow,not_removed,its mop pvp gear you can buy it from the old mop pvp vendors in pandaria just take the portal to vale from dalaran and fly to the appropriate vendor on the wall costs marks of honor
wow,not_removed,i believe its monk season
wow,not_removed,monk tyrannical gladiator helm horde side
wow,not_removed,my apologizes that im not the first person ever to notice this and want to share it on reddit
wow,not_removed,because everyone is on reddit all the time and has seen everything ever posted s
wow,not_removed,spoken too im gonna just go around stormwind speaking pandaren then
wow,not_removed,not that theres much of a difference in this game since you cant actually hear them
wow,not_removed,thats hilarious
wow,not_removed,proud noble and dedicated devourers of all things dumpling
wow,not_removed,can confirm thats the same route i took great pictures
wow,not_removed,its not just that unless the other comments were wrong thats also how pandaren looks to nonpandaplayers in chat
wow,not_removed,costs marks of honor ah unobtainable then
wow,not_removed,not the first or the second maybe the
wow,not_removed,you know you can search right
wow,not_removed,right and i skipped mop for the most part so i certainly didnt know about this and its not like im going to search for something i dont know exists
wow,not_removed,yes spoken it sounds like all omnoms i beleive it is supposed to sound like eating sounds because you know pandas eat
wow,not_removed,you get marks from pvp boxes
wow,not_removed,to be fair this is one of the huge legitimate problems with textonly communication you cant impart tone or nonverbal communication items
wow,not_removed,thanks captain
wow,not_removed,were you born yesterday
wow,not_removed,you ever tried farming those
wow,not_removed,i guess i should have put s huh
wow,not_removed,i won like bgs a couple days ago and didnt even get one whats the drop rate
wow,not_removed,nope
wow,not_removed,very very low it would seem i have gotten one since the expansion came out
wow,not_removed,in this case yeah definitely i suppose my point was lost that not all can detect it all the time
wow,not_removed,well you look young enough
wow,not_removed,so you understand his joke then
wow,not_removed,ganking is many things but rare isnt one of them
wow,not_removed,i had a in zangarmash the other day with all truly truly great i wasnt expecting it to still be possible
wow,not_removed,nah its pretty rare i leveled on a higher population pvp realm earlier in wod and got ganked maybe once or twice the entire time
wow,not_removed,warcraft not hellokittyislandcraft
wow,not_removed,it was his choice i clearly outlined the differences
wow,not_removed,it may depend somewhat on which faction you are on but for me it wasnt uncommon to spend more time dead than alive in eg timeless isle or levelling zones starting at gorgrond
wow,not_removed,yeah if youre leveling a heavily disadvantaged faction maybe my experience was that the only really active zone was hellfire peninsula which was generally just some random or in garbage gear killing quest npcs
wow,not_removed,thats nighthold progress overall not by method
wow,not_removed,so guys and gals are we gonna see a guldan kill before reset
wow,not_removed,if you spent more than seconds on that page you wouldve realized that its about the whole world first race in general and not methods personal progress
wow,not_removed,he should go to httpsusbattlenetaccountmanagement click his wow account scroll down then click additional services click public test realm account i dont know if you need to have had a subscription in the past months or something like that but thats the procedure
wow,not_removed,i find holy priest to be a jack of all trades echo of light slapping hot on the person you are healing not alot small aoe heals but not the greatest and massive single target heals i have a single target skill on quiet the short cooldown that could heal hp instantly in a press of a single button
wow,not_removed,holy priests divine hymn is their big cool down heals for a lot and increases healing received also have guardian spirit which is an interesting cool down disc priests an interesting combo of dps and healing through atonement some interesting cool downs with pain suppression a single target damage reduction ability power word barrier which reduces damage taken by if you stand in it druids great raid healing with hots awesome cool down with tranquility and lots of druids choose two minute tranq which is great for raiding also ironbark for a dr cooldown resto shamans spirit link totem is a great raid saver redistributes health and is a dr big healing cool down is healing tide totem lots of other nice utility possible good for aoe heals when you are stacked up teamshaman monks awesome tank cool down with cocoon and a nice raid wide cool down with revival ive seen them down well with tank and raid healing holy paladins still considered the tradition tank healer with beacon of light avenging wrath is a nice cool down it increases their healing down by a certain amount but not particularly raid useful lay on hands instant full cast heal on one target can be a tank saver aura mastery can be a nice healing cool down
wow,not_removed,monk brings a crackbird
wow,not_removed,mistweavers bring erhm yup thats about it
wow,not_removed,hope
wow,not_removed,salt lots of salt
wow,not_removed,since holy priests aoe is arguably the greatest though
wow,not_removed,when you have and while also critting im not saying that serenity isnt strong its extremely so but most all priests are lacking the gear to semireliably deliver heals in gear my crits on tanks without healing taken averages on
wow,not_removed,you forgot that druid is the only one with a cr as a healer also got innervate which they themselves can use or give to others
wow,not_removed,disc priests an interesting combo of dps and healing through atonement some interesting cool downs with pain suppression a single target damage reduction ability power word barrier which reduces damage taken by if you stand in it disc also brings a minute cd on lights wrath which if properly executed is a huge raidwide heal
wow,not_removed,i think spirit link totem deserves more recognition it makes certain strategies viable to begin with having a resto shaman is essential to a raid i would say
wow,not_removed,disc also brings massive healing scaling ie they can heal more than a full tranq without using any cds from a single penance cast when they use cooldowns their raw healing is unmatched by any other healer unfortunately discs healing is gated by their mana but if you stack it with innervates and wisdom disc does insane healing
wow,not_removed,also remember that holts symbol of hope is basically another raid cd
wow,not_removed,lol whwn i first heard tank healer i thought it meant a tank and a healer at the same tkme like disc priest is a dps healer started playing months ago and havent stopped paly has been the moat fun ive had healing
wow,not_removed,mw bring two oh shit buttons first cocoon for the tank oh shit tank is randomly at np life cocoon second is revival oh shit whole raid is at np revival bonus if you snipe a tranq or aura mastery with it
wow,not_removed,monks are like if all of them had a baby that can do it all but excel in nothing
wow,not_removed,mw and rsham have far more aoe burst capability and smart casts to boot definitely would not call them the greatest though they are good at it
wow,not_removed,seems more accurate yes on average in gear can go upwards if used with other cds but thats a one time only and usually its overkilloverheal
wow,not_removed,in my gear as a druid i can get crits with regrowth if all my hots are up on the target then we add another from my trait due to living seed and another from my living seed the next time he gets hit then i also got lucky since resto is technically my offspec i got the balance boots which increase my regrowth heal by per cast of wrathand lunarstrike but noone will cast that as it requires moonkin form so i managed to get a crit living seed living seed bonus ps i accidently killed an dps during a mythic run because i forgot i had built up my regrowth power so when he was at like and i was just gonna regrowth him i got a megacritpun intended and basically had so much heal on him that i didnt have time to burn it down without risking the other players life so i was like oh shit well check your overflowing youre dead bye
wow,not_removed,divine hymn is a min cd but indeed its one of the stronger healing cds its only weakness is that its channeled and in en holy priests were the perfect spot healers not tank that shit was for monks and pallies but its true that now holy priests aoe is amazing probably one of the best healing classes for nh
wow,not_removed,i feel like the gs explanation might use some clarification healing taken an extra healing taken from all sources which makes this an incredible life saver in raids for tankspeople in a dire situation its arguably weaker than lay on hands since loh is instant but if a tank is dangerously low and gs is popped on him within hes full life with basic casts added benefit is this effect lasts for a solid you basically put it on the person hotfh him and forgot about him for while focusing on other priodying targets
wow,not_removed,and a surprisingly good off tank in a pinch if they took guardian affinity
wow,not_removed,so we should use our only cds as oh shit buttons now thats a way to make us even more useless
wow,not_removed,i wish they were more impressive i dont doubt monks are great because theyre obviously mythic viable but they just seemmeh pvp though theyre amazing
wow,not_removed,except in pvp where they excel at everything and literally never die figuratively
wow,not_removed,oops i fucked up l and youre going to slowly die hilarious 😂😵
wow,not_removed,oh yeah its ofc sorry about that it just feels like cry
wow,not_removed,all true and very comprehensive
wow,not_removed,after all ironbark barkskin ironfur can hold you alive for sometime
wow,not_removed,our cooldowns are really nice and honestly our versatility is what can make us appealing we can fit most any situation were not the best at all of them but we do well enough need tank healing well spec statue and focus that down thunder focus and renewing help with topping off the dps all in all were not in a bad spot imo
wow,not_removed,youre fucking hilarious that doesnt mean that you have more burst aoe healing potential than smart casts essence font or chain heal also rsham mastery press cbt spam ch press ag spam ch and youve topped off the raid
wow,not_removed,well actually the guy in question did lie to us as he had never done eoa on mythic at all or any keystone above before so he actually took a lot of stupid dmg didnt do mechancis properly even after we explained them briefly but since he was a guild mate we let it slide slightly
wow,not_removed,i love where we are right now mw feels so rewarding just gotta take a step back every once in awhile and watch your heals bounce along like one of those old singalong cartoons
wow,not_removed,nobody said burst aoe healing except for you holy priests are doing incredibly well now in aoe situations their aoe heals beat font by a large margin and chain heal as well no need to be so ignorant man
wow,not_removed,im referring specifically to innervate which is best used by healers with a lot of aoe burst and preferably smart casts shaman mastery makes innervate insane as a pseudo raid cd right off the bat we can push out a lot more healing during innervate than an hpriest can just because of how we scale with low hp targets
wow,not_removed,hps metrics are counting something very general and doesnt show disparity between the type of output going out aoe or st rdruids have a reputation for being braindead kings and are high up there but that doesnt mean that theyre good at aoe burst healing they just happen to be high up on hps meters moreover high parses generally mean cheese strats we also have far more data on heroic than we do mythic right now so there simply isnt enough info to go off of itll take the logs a while to catch up a lot of people arent even at right now due to dps players getting priority over gear mw always starts off very strong simply due to vers stacking but theyre going to fall off again
wow,not_removed,yeah but now youre referring to a specific scenario when the discussion at hand was in relation to aoe healing between the healers in a normal situation hpriest definitely wins
wow,not_removed,shaman mastery is still worth noting not stacking it as a shaman just makes you stupid
wow,not_removed,chain heal is on average when running unleash life inside of innervate our rotation is essentially hr slam cbt ch spam ag ch spam ag captures cbt and does a huge amount of healing a good ag alone is healing on a cd cbt is very attainable during periods of high damage even outside of innervates haste buff simply due to the fact that im brushing mastery with it i can go for easily on the other side of the coin poh does avg taken from one of sups logs whereas sanctify is healing on a cd thinking
wow,not_removed,these are averages from actual logs much as how the ch is also an average from my own logs if it could all be simmed id just do that instead but thats unfortunately not the case even when sanctify is back off cd do you really want to waste a gcd during innervate for an instant cast you can wait on it and push out more pohs thats still only a addition to your healing anyway even if you do use it thats a third of what just cbt can push out which takes on of our healing so were pushing out healing to get that cbt innervate is a pseudo raid cooldown and we utilize it very well our kit just lends well to getting a lot out of it not to mention that our totems scale with haste which is why sephuz is very strong on fights like spellblade and helya all of this is counting only the standard innervate rotation and not the htt we can throw in there because we can cast while using htt however there arent all that many situations that could require healing cbt ag without haste bonus idk how much it would be during innervate i dont have a log on hand just my standard avg and a htt total of healing htts alone are possible with sephuz on a boss like helya but those are under very good conditions htts are easy even outside of innervate let alone with the haste bonus thats a lot more healing than an hpriest can push out during the innervate window even with their mastery the priority for innervate is as follows disc rsham mw hpriest rdruidhpal
wow,not_removed,httplegionwowheadcomartifactcalc click on them each in turn and theres an appearance tab at the bottom
wow,not_removed,wowhead i guess or mmochampion
wow,not_removed,wowhead has them in each class guide
wow,not_removed,arms warrior has big numbers really big sword wielding class hits hard
wow,not_removed,i only know casters but fire mage is a pretty crit intense class
wow,not_removed,arcane mages hit pretty hard my arcane blasts crit for million with rune of power and arcane power mil without execution sentence for ret paladins also crits for about mil for me
wow,not_removed,why split the title half into the post
wow,not_removed,i crit close to mil with full moon as balance
wow,not_removed,what kinda numbers so you see i know as a destro lock i can easily but what does fire see
wow,not_removed,mil pyros
wow,not_removed,definitely not too big they just crit a lot
wow,not_removed,really varies we kind of have a lot of damage sources so it isnt all at once fireballs that dont crit deal about whereas a peak pyroblast without the bracers is in the high and thats during our cds where theyre back to back plus both aoe trinkets that i use scale off of my paragon traits so as an flame wreath ticks on st do happen though thats a bit of an extreme
wow,not_removed,just leveled my mage i was surprised to see ebonbolts as frost at ilv
wow,not_removed,yup thats the wonder of singleuse nondot abilities im seeing with prolonged power the icy veins golden trait
wow,not_removed,i just got that trait oo looking forward to testing
wow,not_removed,this effect didnt end upon leaving i am out in the world with almost haste fof is a sec cd rsk is not sure what bug this is but its mildly entertaining
wow,not_removed,its pretty selfguided these days you get your first quests pop immediately on your screen and then the leveling through draenor is well guided and easy to follow for getting back into endgame theres a catch up zone tanaan with high level gear to get you into lfr and then you can try and find normal groups in looking for group or a site like openraid for transmog just hoard all the stuff you want to keep until legion all soulboundaccountbound items will be added to your transmog librarywardrobe automatically any quest rewards youve earned on your account will get added as well even if you dont have the items anymore any items that are bind on equip when the expansion drops wont be learned but you can equip them to unlock them on your wardrobe logging into alts will update your wardrobe for their items otherwise its reasonably straight forward use a site like icyveins to find information for class rotational abilities and how to do raidsdungeons mechanics wise
wow,not_removed,yes hold onto everything for xmog apparently only stuff for your class will register so if youre a rogue and got a sweet cloth helmet for your warlock it will not unlock for you as you dont use cloth as your primary armor same with weapons you have to be able to use them same boat as you but i came back for wod launch leveled to then quit again leveling is easy if you want flying youre gonna have to get loremaster by doing basically every single quest in every zone so youll be by the time youre done it all once you hit do your shipyard quest for your garrison your personal townmain quest hub you build from lvl it unlocks your dailies in tanaan jungle which will help you earn rewards ilvl which will get you into lfr raids youll need to get to run hellfire citadel on lfr
wow,not_removed,wow is currently under ddos as mentioned in the threads allll over and on blizzards cs twitter
wow,not_removed,its not just you its like if players especially myself the game keeps crashing porbably cuz theres so many people on it feels like its being ddos
wow,not_removed,before this ddos business i had the same problem in the eye of azshara dungeon killed the first boss then i disconnected relog disconnect immediately with that error and it kept happening til i was kicked then it was fine
wow,not_removed,same the loading bar almost is complete but then disconnects im trying to log into my shaman order hall
wow,not_removed,except its only on the character in halls of valor and my brother who shares a connection with me isnt having a single issue
wow,not_removed,that is the thing about ddos my old mucker its non uniform meaning whilst ur halls of valor char can be dcing all the time you could play another one and you wouldnt feel a thing
wow,not_removed,it could be a problem with instance servers im having the same problem but in nefs lair
wow,not_removed,the issue is with loading any instance i couldnt take any portals or hearthstones during the ddos all good now though
wow,not_removed,this was my heroic kromog progression when our main tank quit and i was learning to tank for the first time to all my raid members at the time im so sorry
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,delete your cache
wow,not_removed,mana what the heck is blizzard thinking with this one this is completely unusable for any healer
wow,not_removed,reminds me of when arenanet pushed polish language pack for the original guild wars live only to find the data got severely corrupted in the process every single item had a description of roughly translated rclick changes warming soup into soup best served cold
wow,not_removed,private server cache most likely
wow,not_removed,ive had such bad luck with gear that unfortunately its an upgrade for my dh for shame
wow,not_removed,is this a joke that im missing or something ive never cared to go near a private server like ever
wow,not_removed,thats the most likely causation of it your cache can get corrupted too just because this happens does not neccesarily mean you went on a private server
wow,not_removed,makes sense you only did one test so that should totally give people a good perspective on the class damage also you dont have the legendary or the piece which is what classes are balanced around if you people honestly are using this video to judge fire mages then i feel sorry for you
wow,not_removed,a little offtopic but is that a weak aura based cast bar if so would you be so kind to share the string
wow,not_removed,nice sample size
wow,not_removed,you may take away my dps but youll never get my living bomb
wow,not_removed,to drop below at that ilevel is so troubling they need to increase fireball damage by another huge if they want our sustain to be competitive
wow,not_removed,time to reroll
wow,not_removed,welp rip fire d
wow,not_removed,dps loss ouch arcane isnt doing much better with the overpowered nerf we are doing as well on ptr sigh
wow,not_removed,want some cheese to the whinesir
wow,not_removed,exactly i have details in the description which mirror what you say i did not include the use of my legendaries since they are the biggest variants this is a simple base comparison we are already a rng dependant class crit being the rng stat and it should surprise noone that this is nonconclusive
wow,not_removed,why the fuck is the class balanced around having a certain legendary 🤔
wow,not_removed,uh if he had included the legendaries then difference would have been worse you know that right
wow,not_removed,if you think specs should be balanced around being extremely lucky by getting a bis legendary then i feel sorry for you
wow,not_removed,all of my auras are from this guy httpsgithubcomafenarafenarui enjoy
wow,not_removed,dont take one parse as the ultimate result
wow,not_removed,lol tell that to the rest of the people who are sayin rip fire mages
wow,not_removed,because all classes are balanced around having their bis gear
wow,not_removed,yea i hate when legendarys make my dps go down
wow,not_removed,i didnt say they should be i said that they are
wow,not_removed,thank you
wow,not_removed,to be fair youll see pretty much the exact same results gap regardless of how many times you do this i spent hours testing talents on the ptr and the best i got there was below my average parse over on live it definitely shouldnt be taken as an indicator to reroll but it certainly makes you wonder when the tuning pass is supposed to happen and whether or not it will be enough
wow,not_removed,im guessing you dont actually play a fire mage its going to take some serious number tweaking to make fire work the combustion nerf changed the spell beyond recognition they removed icy veins nerfed crit and flame on and i forgot rop literally all of our best spells and best stat got nerfed we arent talking about one or two spells here you cant make this up lol so with all of those spells on live we can currently just break the top in equal gearskill now nerf your number abilitycd to the ground that literally carries your spec and try tell me that with a straight face every thing is going to be ok then on top of that give your spec a flat nerf to its best stat as well as to you next three best spells you use in your down time people always love to sit back and run their mouth when its not their class but they would literally be doing the same thing if it were their class stop being a hypocrite as of right now its shit period again they would have to do massive number tweaking to bring it back up to what they were previously and if they plan on doing that then why the fuck did you destroy the spec in the first place just to make it look like your not actually lazy assholes as far as talking about we dont know how the set bonuses will affect anything the two set is blah at best and yay we have a chance to gain some haste our worst scaling stat mastery is worse for st but the value goes up with each add i really hope you dont actually play a fire mage because its quite apparent that you do not understand a single thing about them fire mages are currently barley breaking top in the percentile we are talking about equal skillgear here not some random pug or a h guild where player skill gaps are wider than the gap between your teeth i could give two shits if some random mage out dpsd you because they are better than you or have better gear than you or vice versa neither is relevant when trying to balance classesspecs and god please dont tell me your judging specs based on five mans because that would really make me sad theres no point discussing any balancing changes outside of the top progression guilds where people are very very close in skillgear period its also hard to fuck up as a fire mage so people tend to notice less bad fire mages compared to some other specs so they need to nerf them to the ground because the skill gap isnt the widest in the game currently it remains to be seen if blizzard will make the right numbers changes but its irrelevant anyways in its current iteration the spec is dead even if they make the numbers right its not going to play the same way it did before not only is combustion a joke now but it might honestly be the worst and most boring minute cd in the game yay we will essentially get mastery for seconds quit literally our worst st stat by the way surely you can see how fucking uselessabsurd that is let alone when you compare it to the old combustion that change alone shows that these morons are incompetentout of touch with their own game it would honestly be laughable if i hadnt spent so much time thus far the spec was built around crit and it was fun for some people then they arbitrarily destroy combustion so now it gives mastery thats honestly the strangest most arbitrary i have ever seen in this game its essentially a minute cooldown our only cooldown that does nothing its going to be garbage outside of cleaveaoe situations imagine your spec had one cooldown and it was pretty good then blizzard arbitrarily takes your one min cd and makes its hit like a wet noodle compared to what it previously did and now its only useable in aoecleave not to mention pointless aoecleave fights are what got people so butt hurt in the first place looking at you mythic xavius because dont comprehend that our damage is really inflated due to ignite spreading to tentacles but that dps literal had no affect on the fight what so ever
wow,not_removed,difference youre quite stupid
wow,not_removed,when did fire ever have icy veins do you even play fire mage i stopped reading there
wow,not_removed,well seeing as is a new raid it makes sense to prepare them for nh
wow,not_removed,i think you missed my point fires set is barely worth equipping because the set bonuses are pathetic and of the items have zero crit the only two that do have crit conflict with legendaries if they were balancing fire around set bonuses id expect fire to be tuned extremely high to compensate im not pessimistic enough to believe that blizzard thinks a dps spec needs to do less st dps than tanks in addition to having terrible set bonuses and horribly itemized gear so i choose to believe there are significant tuning changes incoming
wow,not_removed,why do you feel the need to insult me the guy tries to come off as someone who knows more about mages than me yet doesnt even know mage spells lol
wow,not_removed,not sure how a piece set thats over ilvl is barely worth lol thats like being level and complaining fire is bad
wow,not_removed,lol he sat down to discuss the very first thing he type is him insinuating that i know nothing trying to defend a video where someone does one test to show that a class is dead
wow,not_removed,you want to level lw to for crafting mount or alchemy for cauldrons
wow,not_removed,as far as i know there is no point up until the high level of current expansion thats where your money will be maybe i havent had a max level profession since the cap was at i never bothered
wow,not_removed,it looks like theres one cosmetic item per profession that actually requires skill level kinda bummed ive been wasting my time but i guess revisiting old instances was sort of fun i guess
wow,not_removed,some professions have items that require to make alchemy for example you need for the cauldron but largely there is no benefit
wow,not_removed,okay wish that was communicated somehow ingame without having to dig through database sites
wow,not_removed,that knowledge is available from the official website as well but i get what youre saying
wow,not_removed,cool thanks for the tip
wow,not_removed,id say your only valid complaint here is that everyone plays them and they wear armour they play completely differently to rogue and shaman
wow,not_removed,as someone who plays a rogue and demon hunter i dont see how they play similar at all have you played one
wow,not_removed,while i dont mind at all the introduction of demon hunters and i am truly happy for the ppl who love them the play style is not for me i thought it looked fun on videos etc but i cant cope with all the weird movement they have but thats just me being too old for it maybe i also a bit sad that they did not update hunter shooting animations and fixed the weird torse twist blood elf male have had for ages
wow,not_removed,the only thing i dont like about demon hunters is that they dont have a ranged spec id love to play one because they look awesome but i just dont like melee im really impressed by all the content ive seen so far though along with the trouble free launch and i think blizzard did a fantastic job of listening to the community about the invasions im a happy customer indeed
wow,not_removed,i dont dislike anything yet but i do have some peeves i was kind of annoyed that the secondary artifact quests didnt supply you with a temporary weapon its kind of on me but when i got my shadow dagger i vendored my old weapon then when i wanted to get the holy artifact i had to do the whole holy quest without a weapon it was still certainly doable but it made it way harder your heals are very weak when you do not have any weapon equipped the artifact system overall is great but it is kind of annoying that since i want to main healer endgame i kind of have to go through the whole leveling experience with a base artifact only upgrading my healing artifact its not a big deal im soon lvl and its not like the upgrades to the artifact matters that much this early but its kind of unsatisfying not sure how they could have done it differently the class hall is very fun and engaging right now but im worried it will become like the garrison later the ideas behind it are good but its still a lot of timegates and chores today i went to my computer quickly before i went to work just to send out a hour mission to get artifact power i dont mind now since its the start of an expansion and exciting but this is the kind of gameplay i didnt like in garrisons i hope theres not too much significance put on these kinds of facebook games later
wow,not_removed,im unhappy with people hating on a new class for no reason sure edge lords and kiddies will play it cause lol im illidan xd but this has been the class ive been waiting for feels closer to a tera class i love the mobility to do damage keeps my carpal tunnel flaring up
wow,not_removed,i hate this thing i dont have to play op
wow,not_removed,im not so happy with people like you who will find anything to bitch and moan about
wow,not_removed,even demon hunter and enhance both are melee resource generators but both play very very differently i dont know how the rogue comparison even works apparently just having fast melee rotations means youre the same
wow,not_removed,yeah ive mained a rogue since i started raiding in wotlk outlaw has been a lot of fun ive played demon hunter enough to get one to then do the khadgar events to get to the broken isles maybe i just havent played it enough to really enjoy it it may also just not be my cup of tea i have a priest as well tried playing it in all specs just cant get into it dh seems like itll be the same situation for me most likely a really good class just not my cup of tea
wow,not_removed,yeah i just did my and priest artifact quests with my holy spec because i didnt have a staff it seems like a really stupid oversight
wow,not_removed,more power to you i dont hate people who play the class at all maybe i just dont like them now because they dont really bring anything new to the table raid group wise that i can see right now i obviously could be wrong
wow,not_removed,the people will bitch about anything meme needs to end its actually worse for discussions than straight up complaining
wow,not_removed,sure with the changes to enhance its become a much more fluid spec i find myself enjoying my shaman more than i did in the past but the idea of generate dump generate dump it gets tiring seeing it on so many classes at this point were talking rogues feral arcane dh enhance etc im not trying to say its inherently bad it was more just a general first impression of the class i guess i only compared rogue to it because i used to be a night elf rogue before i swapped to dwarf and so using and seeing the same mog on my dh made some weird connection in my mind probably just my rogue bias p
wow,not_removed,im in the same boat on my rogue started outlaw but now i wanna do the assassination route and i dont have daggers it says the quest must be completed in that spec guess ill buy some cheap greens or wait for a pair to drop lol
wow,not_removed,generate and dump is so ridiculously vague that it doesnt even count as a valid gripe to have thats literally the only similarity they generate and they dump dh generates it and dumps it in a stream of one or two abilities enhance generates it but enhance dumps it in different ways it doesnt dump it all in one go and it rarely dumps it all quickly dh generates for a bursty dump and enhance generates for a sustained dump and enhance barely even dumps in the general term
wow,not_removed,i dont know if this is the case for all the halls but as a dh the quartermaster or whatever you call it in the hall had a green set for gold also idk if mine was bugged but it actually let me do the quest in my first spec anyway
wow,not_removed,its a armory bug gems are
wow,not_removed,just to add the rare gems for secondary stats are the saber eyes op means are mainstats otherwise correct gem values in armory are wrong
wow,not_removed,ook thanks guys
wow,not_removed,legendaries
wow,not_removed,you can chose your loot specialization by right clicking on your portrait
wow,not_removed,rng
wow,not_removed,took me casts yesterday dont think its been changed
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,sweet ill get on in the morning its really late here but i appreciate the help have a good night
wow,not_removed,because they want to coerce people into logging on to their mains so they can do some world pvp of course this usually means that they wait until someone gets on their then theyll mount up and hover yards in the air like a cool guy because thats what world pvp is now
wow,not_removed,because that is life people want power once they get power they want to use it
wow,not_removed,because they can i know it may sound douche but as long as npcs can be killed you are free to do it
wow,not_removed,why not
wow,not_removed,the only times i do it is if i randomly stumble upon an alliance while doing old quest for mog or farming old mats i dont just straight kill people though i like to wave at them or something and if they wave back ill leave em alone and be on my way if not well it pays to be friendly
wow,not_removed,because its fun to see people qq like this
wow,not_removed,if people wouldnt afk in garrisons and ashran all day long this would be entertaining maybe legion will improve on this part and bring more world pvp i usually dont kill low lvl npcs but when i dois to get alliance high level attention
wow,not_removed,i kill low lvl npcs because i have to if i want loremaster i hope thats why most ppl do bot to just be dicks i inv anyone in the area to my group so they get credit as well least i can do if im wiping the board not trying to make questing harder on everyone else
wow,not_removed,that is so sad when my main is the one you generally not you specifically keep killing in the hope that it will bring out something higher level
wow,not_removed,no one is safe get a hunter and stack buffs with the right gear you can burst someone down whilst using a parachute theres an orc hunter on emerald dream who loves doing this in tannan
wow,not_removed,ive killed him he always hovers with that warlock friend hes susceptible to rogue stun locks
wow,not_removed,happened something similar to me while questing for netherwing faction me flying towards the island alliance hunter comes from behind jumps with parachute i got dazed and fell into the twisting nether while he was falling slowly to the landmass
wow,not_removed,and some people dont want you to finish the grind as soon as possible
wow,not_removed,this game is called world of warcraft alliance dont want you to hit max level and would therefore corpse camp you andor kill low level npc
wow,not_removed,use group finder and hop to a pve realm problem solved no need to whine when there are simple solutions
wow,not_removed,been answered times in this sub just look through the posts here
wow,not_removed,new player guide search brings nothing if you know of something you probably could have posted a link in the time that it took you to type a snarky response
wow,not_removed,honestly wasnt trying to be a dick an encompassing guide is easy enough to find online was really trying to impress upon you that most of anything you want to know has been answered here and refining your search might prove fruitful anything specific you want to know fire away ill answer if you really cant find that info posted already
wow,not_removed,all i see is simon says from blades edge dailies shudders
wow,not_removed,we found his journal he always seemed like such a nice boy
wow,not_removed,a page of murloc poems callously vandalised with a recipe for shame op
wow,not_removed,i just typed it into the chat window
wow,not_removed,could someone explain please
wow,not_removed,this looks like the scribblings of a serial killer not that id know just sayin
wow,not_removed,i always just whispered the simon says thing to myself
wow,not_removed,with the servers being so laggy i cant complete that quest anymore
wow,not_removed,war flashbacks
wow,not_removed,my favorite picture like this is from direhorn farming back in mop i still dont have any of those mounts after people started using crz to get them the experience felt cheaper and i stopped working on it tracking the spawn times and predicting where the next one would come up was a lot of fun
wow,not_removed,i would just type out in say what was done never wrote them down
wow,not_removed,stupid ogrila dailes
wow,not_removed,send this anonymously to the police theyll have a lot of fun
wow,not_removed,why didnt you just use s worked fine for me
wow,not_removed,ogrila quest theres an addon now ogrilazy its just perfect
wow,not_removed,one day during dailies friend of mine in group starting typing numbers in instead of the colors curious as to why he was typing numbers instead of colors i asked and come to find out he was actually color blind and it made it easier for him to just use numbers in a clockwise fashion
wow,not_removed,tanks will never forget i cannot heal through that much damage did you forget to equip your heaviest armor
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,i watched my dad do this but he would just type yyygbb into say does not seem like that was the most well known method
wow,not_removed,is this a thorium brotherhood thing remind me what it is it i am never forgetting
wow,not_removed,you could of just gotten that add on back in the day
wow,not_removed,lol oh god i remember that
wow,not_removed,for some damn reason known only to god himself they changed the simon game in the prepatch to have a mechanic that resets the damn thing now a fire nova will happen during your input every few seconds after the sixth sequence if you activate a color during the nova you reset it and have to start over so wait until the nova dissipates activate two colors at most then wait for the next nova
wow,not_removed,i use to type them out instead of write it down gg orgrila dailys
wow,not_removed,instructions unclear got hellgate in my room after reading this loud next step please
wow,not_removed,holy crap i forgot about that
wow,not_removed,use say ya newb
wow,not_removed,i used to just whisper myself the combination as it came out so it would be right on my screen
wow,not_removed,i really hated dailies i made this pally on day of tbc and i only just recently got my daily quest achievement
wow,not_removed,holy shit thats why i started getting ptsd damn that grind for free flasks
wow,not_removed,i think i had a nod that would let you remember the colors
wow,not_removed,theres an addon for that that was relevant when the mini game was relevant
wow,not_removed,aaaaaughibbrgubugbugrguburgle
wow,not_removed,dingdingding we have a winner of the more common sense than op award
wow,not_removed,in the days of burning crusade there was a region in the blades edge mountains which had a group of daily quests to give you reputation with a faction so that you could get a particular mount it required playing simon that basic computer game where it flashes a series of colors and you would have to repeat the pattern so much simon by the time you got the mount you never wanted to visit the area ever again
wow,not_removed,this is one of the only ones i have left for the blades edge mountains quest achievement and when i get to the servers always lag out and miss a few colours when showing the sequence so painful
wow,not_removed,that was around in bc to
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,now i feel stupid
wow,not_removed,no ogrila daily in bc simon says quest
wow,not_removed,yep rep up to honored i think maybe friendly been a while
wow,not_removed,yeah the items he has listed is for thorium brotherhood rep
wow,not_removed,maybe a bit late but i used httpsmodscursecomaddonswowogrilazy
wow,not_removed,i typed it in s but yeah
wow,not_removed,for dedicated healers with no alts this was the only way to make gold it cost gold to respec to a dps spec i did skettis and ogrilla dailies almost everyday of that entire expansion people complain about mop dailies but bc dailies were literaly required for me to continue to play not just some vanity reputation
wow,not_removed,by the time you got the mount you never wanted to visit the area ever again rep grinds in a nutshell
wow,not_removed,ogrila rewarded a mount
wow,not_removed,oh my goodness i had completely forgotten about this i got exalted and never looked back i must have blocked it out of my memory
wow,not_removed,ogrila rep gives you a mount werent they the guys you needed to quest with to start the netherwing grind or am i misremembering
wow,not_removed,ok that explains the really weird index card my sister left on my desk last time she came over and played i thought she was just losing her mind
wow,not_removed,you know whats worse getting the rep mounts from bem and for the netherdrake on a character thats been deleted prior to account wide mounts i hate myself a bit more every time i remember
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,oh that thing lol i had forgotten
wow,not_removed,oh how i wish i had known that existed back in tbc
wow,not_removed,me too made it so much easier
wow,not_removed,best addon ever
wow,not_removed,lmao thats a great addon name
wow,not_removed,personally i chose a box of four letters on my keyboard for example qwas positioned the camera above my head and mindlessly pressed buttons
wow,not_removed,man i played a holy pally back then with no alt and those dailies were litteraly my only source of income do dailies spend money on flasks and pots raid bt next day rince n repeat
wow,not_removed,mop dailies werent just vanity at the start of the expansion they were needed to gear up for raiding
wow,not_removed,nether ray
wow,not_removed,ogrila didnt but the dailies were near other dailies that gave rep for the netherway so you did them as part of your gold farming they oh wasnt bad for casters either
wow,not_removed,yeah thats how i did it too d wow its been so long now
wow,not_removed,i had notepad open on another screen and would do that with the numpad
wow,not_removed,dailies in tbc were required to unlock dungeons mate you literally couldnt attempt to get gear until you did dailies for all the dungeon areas and got the heroic dungeon keys this was dialed back on the nonheroic only dungeons late in the expansion with the system being missing from wrath and being removed in outland with the release of cata if i recall correctly
wow,not_removed,only shatari skyguard give nether rays
wow,not_removed,are you sure arent nether rays shatari skyguard rep rewards the ogrila quartermaster doesnt sell mounts
wow,not_removed,the heroic keys were a cool idea but goddamn if they werent annoying as hell to get i think theyre doing something similar with legion but you unlock the dungeon by completing the main story line quests in a zone way easier than having to wait days or maybe even weeks to get a heroic key
wow,not_removed,they are shatari skyguard but the quest for simon is in that same area so that is probably what op was thinking about
wow,not_removed,uhm no the shatari skyguard are all in terokkar forest while ogrila are in blades edge mountains
wow,not_removed,skyguard have a camp in ogrila as well they have you catch netherrays and bomb fel cannons
wow,not_removed,but yes it is finally fixed
wow,not_removed,it was a problem for all the larger races i believe tauren male draenei etc
wow,not_removed,yeah i was telling my guildies one of the best changes is as a tauren i could not mount the strider while in water and jump atop of it i could as a dh and i believe i did it as an orc rogue too but now oh man now life is goooood
wow,not_removed,im also noticing this change in game thisthe set transmog section are the best changes
wow,not_removed,another issue was that when you glided into water as dh your water strider would never jump on water and kept swimming when i get home i will check and let you know if this has changed as well
wow,not_removed,water strider scrubs being able to use water walking any mount is where its at have you ever seen a primal flamesaber walk on water
wow,not_removed,i have used water strider through the entire expansion and i havent noticed this issue
wow,not_removed,i wonder if they similarly fixed aquatic mounts randomly dismounting when you are swimming at the surface even if you dont jump out of the water personally i think you should stay mounted on an aquatic mount even if you jump out of the water accidentally hitting spacebar while swimming somewhere and having to stop to remount is ridiculous
wow,not_removed,this
wow,not_removed,typed wow wrong loot spec shooting stars into google
wow,not_removed,beat me to it lol
wow,not_removed,bless you sir
wow,not_removed,ive been searching for this as well you made my day
wow,not_removed,yes
wow,not_removed,yeah you can install it on as many computers as you want however you need to each have your own battlenet log in
wow,not_removed,the account can only be logged in at one place at a time you can install it as much as you want but only able to play them at a time
wow,not_removed,so can i have different battlenet tags but use the same wow account
wow,not_removed,the license not account
wow,not_removed,thats sort of what i mean sorry if i worded it incorrectly
wow,not_removed,and would it lock my account up too
wow,not_removed,oh ok thank you
wow,not_removed,nope
wow,not_removed,you and your brother can both play on your account on separate computers but not at the same time if he is playing on your account with his comp then the moment you log into your wow account with your comp he would be disconnected and vice versa
wow,not_removed,well that sucks
wow,not_removed,yeah obviously we would communicate who wants to play but thats the answer i was really looking for thanks
wow,not_removed,why not just have separate accounts account sharing is against the rules
wow,not_removed,i hear dk is a great tank to have for mythic the death grip the aoe grip the bres etc etc all nice to have ive disliked playing them for a few xpacs so i didnt bother trying mine this one theyre a meat shield with self healing so they can be squishy in a sense but without being bursted down can never die id prefer to play dh myself since its the same type of tank but more fun even though the dk bringing grip and bres is kind of fucking nice guardian is by far the best when it comes to aoe dps its the worst on st dps probably the easiest tank to heal too coming from a healers perspective basically you thrash on cd mangle on cd swipe in between maul with excess rage and keep popping one of your defensive skills to burn rage depending on physical or magical damage incoming pop enraged regen after taking some heavy damage gg bonus youre a fucking bear paladin is pretty good due to their amazing kit insane amounts of interupts especially with chain shield procs great cleave damage huge tool kit which including the almighty lay on hands and bubble if you like button mashing this is for you always a button to hit at low haste theres like gcds where you might wait great tool kit with many defensives and utility spells think freedom sacrifice bop etc lots of self healing and you can even use it on someone else if you dont need the hp as a shielder they arent squishy either bonus plate transmogs are the shit
wow,not_removed,druid and warriors just make it look easy prot pallies look op with the damage they output i like pallies because they have a lot of ranged abilities lots of interupts support abilities for the group div shield to cheese tank mechanics
wow,not_removed,im really enjoying pally tanking again though im biased because i used to tank with it back in bc never really got into warriors or druids but they seem to have some of the best mitigation brm is still a bit rubbish at the moment
wow,not_removed,dk tank here only thing i didnt like about dks was the lack of def cds cenarius was a pain since last patch its perfectly fine and i enjoy every aspect of the game as dk can solo worldbosses sit on mine in ab for ages by myself do worldquests in secs outheal bad healers in mythic and can even solo some bosses in mythic the lack of mobility is annoying here and there but skystep potions are my personal solution
wow,not_removed,so far im loving the blood life and this is someone who exclusively played dps bloods rotation is easy to step into and has a lot of damage mitigation plus with certain classes self heals vampiric bloodgift of the naaru works wonders
wow,not_removed,i main a blood dk since legion release and tbh i enjoyed him at the start when gear was low he looked super strong but as i started going in higher m i got annoyed by the fact that i felt and still feel that i am taking way too much dmg compared to other tanksthe lack of mobility is also is very annoying the dmg is great but i feel like a clunky sponge all the timealso itemization sucks but maybe thats because i was used to mastery stacking at previous expansions and it feels odd that its not good as a stat now if you are starting from scratch i would go for a shield tank warrpala are pretty strong and have interesting kits bear is strong but looks a bit boring imho
wow,not_removed,as a dh tank i can say that were pretty nice the mobility is great and if you know when and how to use your cooldowns a lot healers will change their minds about us
wow,not_removed,if you like button mashing this is for you no its not button mashing its carefully choosing the right utility for the right time seriously though i feel so gimped when i try to play as other tank classes i do find myself envious of the dk grips though
wow,not_removed,guardian is by far the best when it comes to aoe dps youre really underestimating blood dks
wow,not_removed,i didnt say blood sucks at dps guardian is top notch though on big aoe cleave its pretty much the general concensus
wow,not_removed,you can swap your loot spec before you open your chest and it will obey that choice
wow,not_removed,both the loot and legendary chance will be for whatever your loot spec is at the moment you open your weekly cache
wow,not_removed,i have the same problem but with the legion pre patch around the corner itll be way more interesting if you spend lots of time fighting against invasions you can collect cool transmog gear and gear in prep for legion which should come out about a month after pre patch if anything at this stage it makes more sense to level up alts and get transmog gameplay is changing so soon that mastering your char in pve or pvp is tricky
wow,not_removed,anyone else have this problem no i simply have alts of all of the classes at should i fancy playing some particular class i find that i do not have these issues in games with more complex combat wows class design is very simplistic and not overly challenging for my taste i never had this problem in daoc for instance despite its classes being way more limited in their combat roles there simply was more to every class than a rotation and a proc or two
wow,not_removed,nothing wrong with playing other classes i would say the majority of people who play wow have plethora of alts that they mess around on to keep the game fresh also playing other classes and getting to know them helps you be a better and more effective pvper
wow,not_removed,i have the garrisons made it ultra painful but otherwise i really just like having options i tend to get bored of roles over actual characters though recently moved from warrior to shaman and gearing him elemental freakin blast in bgs so far maybe ill play an affliction lock next week maybe ill main a resto druid for legion who knows i can really do whatever i want
wow,not_removed,just do the class trials of each neither class is really in a great place in this xpac as far as endgame raiding but if youre talking mostly solo content than either will probably suffice check out the class trial and see which seems to call to you more
wow,not_removed,i have a demon warlock and a bm hunter on my twinks i have to say i like the warlock a bit more best lookin as dwarf and i mean the whole raid sees your cobalt bolts shooting at the bosses plus you can summon which is nice hunter is imo only cool because of your petsbeastsbut i dont like it anymore maybe it is because i started my wow with a hunter
wow,not_removed,speak for yourself survival and beast mastery are doing pretty well
wow,not_removed,edit and tbh nobody looks at a hunter but at his pets id say or at least i do but the warlock is worth having a look at
wow,not_removed,yeah and demonologyaffliction seem to be doing well too in heroics and mythic
wow,not_removed,fire is still taking a huge hit pi has been changed from to per stack and we lost crit baseline sure some spell dmg has been buffed but the couple of fire mages in my guild who have done some new parses are around dps less than usual parsed without bracers
wow,not_removed,so they nerf pyro dmg by in an earlier patch especially because the bracers did too much dmg now they nerf the bracers dmg but buff the dmg of pyro in general whats the deal here blizzard do you want us to rely on having the bracers to deal dmg or not yes it is a nerf to bracers because of ice floes removal but i honestly still think they will be top tier by a huge margin time will tell besides that fire still needs huge sustain buffs to be able to compete with other specs i hope this is not the last iteration
wow,not_removed,not feeling like we are in a great place i started leveling my arcane artifact when i initially saw the first patch notes sounds like that was probably a really good thing
wow,not_removed,imo biggest nerf to us is the removal of ice floes did it return this build at all the nerfing of our stats is kicking us while were down on a personal note i had to quit mythic raiding because of work the impending nerfs make it easier to
wow,not_removed,from the testing i did on the ptr before this patch at ilvl i was doing the same amount of dps on live as i was on ptr i was using flamepatch and meteor as my final and everything else the same except for rop i was using incanters shield or we it is called i would start like normal use my trinketpot and all that jazz and combust phase i would use pyroblast after combust phase i would use flamestrike on all my hot streak procs until combust was back again and would use pyro during combust phase i could consistently pull dps at and at as ilvl this build may not matter anymore as they are buffing pyroblast again but i thought it would be fun to share that flamestrike for a while was higher dps than pyro on ptr
wow,not_removed,whoa i didnt even know about the pi change from to that is so bad
wow,not_removed,on live i have crit and ptr now i have new secondary stats have come
wow,not_removed,it does feel like its required to have the bracers still to really push numbers and even then youll just be midrange on the meters i feel like some of the sustainability and also the continued reduction in mobility could be combatted by increasingreworking the effects of mastery if ignite does more damage over time moving around an encounter wont hurt numbers so much
wow,not_removed,arcane without ice floes is quite fucky though missing a tick of evocation makes me shudder for my mage friends
wow,not_removed,so as someone who just hit as an arcane mage ive been meaning to switch to fire should i just roll arcane for my artifact or swap to fire like ive been meaning to
wow,not_removed,wow cool concept im about with legendary bracers and pull dps on live no time warp but with a similar build and rotation was only managing dps on the ptr i didnt think to try the combo you mentioned so it would be interesting to see if i could come close to my live dps i had basically given up hope at this point on my fire mage
wow,not_removed,thats a bit more than the cut across the board i didnt realize they had planned this patch to be the secondary stat weight nerf unless i missed that somewhere
wow,not_removed,yeah i didnt use warp either on live i had got a few upgrade and am at now and with flask and food was doing around at damage with the classic spec with the weird one i was doing on ptr with no flask or food was at over at didnt want to copy my character again because i rarely am able to get into the servers lol also i dont have any legendaries so that would skew things depending on what you have
wow,not_removed,how the heck do you pull that much dps im on my mage and sometimes dont even pull
wow,not_removed,my buddy dropped from to
wow,not_removed,what enchants do you have mark of the hidden satyr gives me more damage then theres the standard ring and cloak enchants for more crit my shock baton trinket adds another if you dont have blast furnace on your artifact thats another i feel like im missing something but the legendary bracers make a big difference probably or so but thats just a rough estimate other than that im itemized at crit and haste haste is a bit more useful if you have the legendary bracers
wow,not_removed,ah ya its a fairly new alt so my artifact power is shit and i only have crit with no wriggling sinew and no legendary but damn i swear i have the rotation down too
wow,not_removed,yeah i have shock baton and wriggling sinew also have full enchants with crit and around haste what is weird is i see a lot of people sayin their crit dropped a lot on ptr but mine only dropped from live so im confused about that
wow,not_removed,well a lot of it has to do with the legendary bracers i get some big crits over million with them that is the equivalent to like fireball crits if not more i think its just gear discrepancy even though we have similar item level
wow,not_removed,i enjoy the spaceship way cooler
wow,not_removed,same with ravenholdt i also heard they didnt want to use ravenholdt bc it was too far away from the broken isles which is a utter bs excuse bc lights hope is in eastern plaguelands
wow,not_removed,hmi dont think its completely out there but with the stuff in the book it seems like theyre a bit more focused on traveling on that spaceship than they are staying in one place there isnt really anything left for them at bt
wow,not_removed,i think akama has been through enough the dude just wants his home back
wow,not_removed,you do recruit akama who is the leader of the broken surely he wouldnt mind you being there
wow,not_removed,doing dh class hall missions we go back to bt cuz akama has info we need and we split his soul again lol akama is a traitor all hail illidan
wow,not_removed,if you pick kayn you have to all but kill akama you beat him and make the shade of akama he doesnt like you being there he doesnt like that you beat him and he doesnt like that you made a copy of him with all of his memories
wow,not_removed,yeah thats if you pick kayn if you pick altruis you get actual akama to come back with you because altruis talks him into it i still like the kayn scenario its more awesome and basically payback for akama being a short sighted dick
wow,not_removed,true even then im fairly sure illidari would be able to take bt by force being more than happy to do so since the broken have betrayed illidan
wow,not_removed,since you can only have one demon hunter per server i was hoping that your choice between kayn and altruis would be canon on all characters on that server but nope my demon hunter has altruis everyone else gets kayn
wow,not_removed,but why would they want to they have a mobile fort now bt was just a the best fort illidan could use at the time and i dont think dh tend to be the nostalgic types so theres really nothing left for them there
wow,not_removed,not saying they should just saying that it couldve been a good alternative to the fel hammer
wow,not_removed,very fun
wow,not_removed,fun is subjective but id say about
wow,not_removed,mobile but pretty squishy abilities feel lightweight definitely not a super durable tank but a good change from the norm
wow,not_removed,i think its more of a
wow,not_removed,how is the aoe
wow,not_removed,aah youre right toaster presents it better
wow,not_removed,if you talent right aoe is actually pretty fun on vengeance definitely one of the better aoe capable tanks also i love the down votes for answering ops question
wow,not_removed,i think it had to do with an addon for me maybe suf or dbm couldve been the pvp mods from dbm iirc but im not sure
wow,not_removed,gtx ti settings at ultra no fps spikes at all in any raids so far
wow,not_removed,just began progress tonight on mythic xavius and my fps dropped considerably
wow,not_removed,yes i almost always get annoying fps issues in there it has also caused issues where my weak auras glitch out and fail to updaterefresh properly when i get spikes
wow,not_removed,its to do with the room i get the occasional issue in en but i get consistent framerate spikes in xaviuss room then found that mates had the same problem too and its because of the way the room renders
wow,not_removed,go with that two charges of shadowstep plan instead of giving shadowstrike a second cd and everything here would be absolutely perfect
wow,not_removed,assassination should do less tunnel target damage and be better at switching its overpowered when they can sit and tunnel a boss forever and suffers when they have to switch just a boring playstyle
wow,not_removed,totally depends on what the ap replacement is gonna be if it is good i doubt your friend will be livid much longer i honestly am kind of on it being removed one for it being an amazing talent it on the otherside being rather boring as a talent hopefully they manage to replace it with something fair and nice
wow,not_removed,please god i hope they do make it so rerolling isnt beneficial i didnt sign up to play dice roll simulator the game every fight i have never played a spec more frustrating in my life than outlaw feels when i just cant fucking roll true bearing or a buff and yet i have to to do competitive damage there are so many ways to make rtb interesting than roll until you get something useful and then you can actually play the game
wow,not_removed,am i the only one who likes sub as it is thats coming from a pvp player though shadow strike has always been my favourite wow ability and ive liked the fact that i have to be conscious of how many shadow dances i use so that i dont waste my burst
wow,not_removed,interesting i use to love rogue back in classictbcwrath but when i came back the only one i enjoyed was outlaw assassination was too dot heavy same reason i cant play feral druid and not about slipping a knife in the back my most iconic assassination memory is being level and coming across a farming alliance mage in the plague lands who had just aoeed down an entire area and sat to drink i stealth up drew my broken bottle and one shot him with an ambush okay so yeah a little scummy but thats still what i think of when i think assassination but it simply doenst feel like that anymore subtly err too many cooldowns and the whole stealthnonstealth thing is really strange outlaw on the other hand is a lot of fun i love the theme and i really love the hook the feeling of a mob or player running from you and you just pull out this massive blunderbus and shoot them in the back amazing however rtb isnt fun most of the time maybe when i get the auto roll trait in my weapon it will be better but as it stands unless you get lucky youre in trouble the other issue is feastfamine energy which they addressed id be fine with an ar nerf if we got slightly more all the time unfortunately outlaw has one of the few artifact abilities that i simply dont like yes its fairly powerful but like frost dks seriously why wasnt the dragon the base one it feels very meh when compared to things like the ww monk huge hit that slots into the rotation
wow,not_removed,ideas for replacements include a shortcooldown aoe poison damage button that costs high energy or something that deals poison damage in a rotationallyinteresting way sounds like exsan for poison
wow,not_removed,cant wait for ap to be gone i fucking hate it i took exang for as long as it was viable and i take alacrity now unless its a boss fight or tyranical week
wow,not_removed,would love to see vendetta having charges like shadowdance
wow,not_removed,how is that any different in fact isnt that strictly worse
wow,not_removed,remove ap make exsanguinate great again d
wow,not_removed,give it some more reliable aoe dmg as well your only proper aoe dmg is a pretty low proc chance
wow,not_removed,there really shouldnt be a class that greatly benefits from tunneling boss because the optimal play would be to tunnel boss and ignore mechanics there should be every incentive for each spec in place to ignore the boss and do mechanics we already have enough trouble with people tunneling bosses as it is
wow,not_removed,that last part about replacing it with something fair and nice is what has my friend all up in arms the post just says that its getting removedreplaced and no news on what the potential replacement is im hoping that news comes out soon but its infuriating to just hear hey a really good talent is getting removed hope youre ready and i was around for karaspire last xpac
wow,not_removed,that bandaid gold trait sucks too
wow,not_removed,word ive counted how many times i get only one less desirable buff and in one combat dummy run i rolled snake eyes ie only one less desirable buff times straight i use a simple weakaura that lets me know by colour if its one buff one good buff two to three buffs four or five or practically never six buffs
wow,not_removed,i do agree about how strange it is the fdk doesnt have dragon attack as main artifact abiliity
wow,not_removed,its already super strong why does it need an extra charge
wow,not_removed,i mainly pvp but i dont see how its worse for pve either shadowstep is able to be used on allies gives you a short speed boost doesnt break cc costs no energy and isnt on the gcd plus if i really needed to shadowstep and ambush at the same time im perfectly capable of doing it myself i dont need an ability that does it for me also itd save me a keybind
wow,not_removed,yeah it was bit more of an involved spec with exsang would have picked rogue if outlaw wasnt rng city and exsang didnt get guttedap made so powerful shame really
wow,not_removed,blizzard has demonstrated such poor foresight and decision making so frequently lately that i dont have much confidence of anything decent replacing it ill be happy if the spec isnt obliterated since i have the boots and shoulders but im not gonna hold my breath
wow,not_removed,i can totally get behind that im not the biggest fan of spell changes or possibly removing them for good seeing how good assassination has been because of it but they did mention ideas for replacements include a shortcooldown aoe poison damage button that costs high energy or something that deals poison damage in a rotationallyinteresting way
wow,not_removed,would lower the duractioncd to make it a the same amount of dps increase purpose of having a charge would mean you could delay it and not see a dps decrease
wow,not_removed,these really are just getting worse
wow,not_removed,you forgot the sauce
wow,not_removed,more of these omg so funny xd haha im texting my grandama ahaha xd
wow,not_removed,demo isnt bad affliction and destro are just better for the fights that are in the current raids low level demo does a lot of damage
wow,not_removed,i believe and i could be wrong people often talk about what spec outshines what when considering the piece trinkets and the legendary ring so at like peak end game with the full set of optimal stuff you should be in the right spec for the right situation however for anything lower than that say just running heroic or whatever i think they are all relatively fine
wow,not_removed,getting complete overhaul in legion demo is not bad destro and aflic outshine in certain situations
wow,not_removed,hes talking about duels which is pvp not pve
wow,not_removed,rwoweconomy has some good guides id recommend doing cata raids for a small chunk of it edit as others have mentioned cata raids are the way to go id suggest leveling you druid up as the is fairly good money and relaxing in my opinion make sure to keep potions of luck going and turn in the keys for big daily wod professions can give some good gold as well as the quests for less common money making check some of the top guides on rwoweconomy or use undermine journal to see what items sell well on your server and farmflip them
wow,not_removed,as everyone else has said farm all of the cata raids for about gold per month per character what you should also do is work on getting your druid to that effectively doubles the gold from cata raids do them all twice the other thing to do in the short term is to work on finishing the quests in draenor doing loremaster of draenor achievement should get you about gold as well i agree that it is probably too late to really make profit on the garrisons with treasure hunters you might break even and might even make a few thousand gold but its probably not worth a huge amount of investment
wow,not_removed,if you dont already have professions take herbalism and mining on the druid and get to and farm felblight in tanaan on my server actually ghost iron ore from pandaria is selling really high its really too late to make money with the inn gold strat so try old raids but do not neglect the shipyard since it doesnt take too long to get set up
wow,not_removed,have a garrison set up with treasure hunters and a inn and farm your cata raids blackwing descent throne of the four winds bastion of twilight firelands and dragonsoul on every week should net you character for just the raids and a garrison with treasure hunters will provide at minimum
wow,not_removed,another option is if you finish leveling the druid and make him either a tank or healer occasionally the random heroic queue will have a call to arms bonus if you play an indemand role more often tank the bonus rewards a guaranteed plus has a chance at the medallion of the legion which goes for around
wow,not_removed,i got burned out on farming cata raids except for finishing my legendaries however having level with level inns generates well more than enough for my token every month with minimal time spent leveling up in general can be a good way to raise money as well level all your characters with enchanting as a profession and disenchant all those quest rewards the mats you produce are worth quite a bit so to that end getting yourself a stable of with inns is a pretty good investment though maybe not with only a few months left in wod
wow,not_removed,well assuming youre on na the price is currently about cata raids on heroic will net you per character per week or per month jewelcrafting garrison daily will give you per day inscription daily follower craft will net you another in vendor trash items you can combine you can mill herbs from your garrison and run work orders for war paints a day to turn into cards of omen war paints equals cards of omen and you can just flip those for an average of each conservative estimate or an average of a day so thats a little over a day or a month before even accounting for follower missions doing that stuff on a single character is enough for a token on na
wow,not_removed,or you can just get a minimum wage job and save yourself several hours of farming
wow,not_removed,if you do heroic cata raids you can make a min of per toon
wow,not_removed,download an addon called tradeskillmaster itll replace your auction addon like auctioneer if you have one do a bit of research into how it works and check out the stormspire forums which is where all the people who play the wow economy congregate also check out the rwoweconomy subreddit im not a serious goblin but i only started using tsm about a month ago and ive made about gold in that time almost solely by using tsm to search for wod mats that are priced low and relisting them at higher prices thanks to some lucky purchases you can also park your character at the ah and wait to see if people post any rare high ticket items for cheaper than they normally go for like mounts i actually made in this past week alone to be fair i started with a very modest stockpile of about gold just like reality its much easier for the rich to get richer than it is for the poor to get rich when you feel comfortable dropping or so gold as a short term investment tsm really becomes the way for you to make more money
wow,not_removed,with only those two i wouldnt recommend it the price on my server is gold for a wow token lets say that you did all raids in the game that gives around gold if you get pets to sell and potential mog to put on ah depending on your server price ofc thats still only around a month per character so id say youd need a few more characters for this to be viable and even then it takes a hella long ting to farm every raid in the game
wow,not_removed,just remember to do them on heroic normal modes dont give out the same amount of money as gold drops
wow,not_removed,what exactly do cata raids do to make you money
wow,not_removed,protip do not drink and reddit read and reread this post multiple times wondering what the heck ive been doing wrong as a druid to not be making twice as much from cata raids eventually reread the ops title got it now
wow,not_removed,i find the shipyard stuff somewhat confusing any tips here
wow,not_removed,the garrison thing wont work it would take longer to set that up now than you would recoup the costs since the prepatch is likely to hit in about a month two at the most and it takes longer than that to get the treasure hunters and level them the best bet is the cata raids
wow,not_removed,i dont have a lvl inn ill start working towards that for cata raids do i vendor all the items or try to ah sell them
wow,not_removed,this wont net you a lot of gold since it doesnt pop very often but when it does the gold you get is well worth how long it takes to complete a heroic dungeon personally i always have an addon called satchel finder running that alerts me whenever a satchel for one of my roles is available and heroic dungeons are so low ilvl that i can just stay in balance and offheal it with natures vigil
wow,not_removed,hehe yeah i would probably never buy a token for in game gold for me the sub does equal a little less than work time how long do i have to grind for gold eu prices exactly
wow,not_removed,my answer do stuff you like to do to earn gold spend it on stuff you like to spend it on only if thats covered think about buying a token i think the point is to avoid spending the realworld money since some cant afford it
wow,not_removed,i have tsm but im horrible at using it i only use it to post auctions now and i stopped that once i started getting around things in the mail i dont know what to do with tsm
wow,not_removed,just to add heroic man as long as you have the gear to do it its literally more gold than
wow,not_removed,they give you a decent sum of gold for simply killing the bosses and then there is another decent sum for vendoring all of the drops from the run on top of everything you can get lucky and get a boe item that sells for a pretty penny on the ah to be used for transmog
wow,not_removed,firelands and dragon soul give a bit over gold each on heroic
wow,not_removed,about setting up the shipyard and requirement or what ships to get a ship needs to be leveled to epic but they can be randomly spawned epic too they come with a crew that you cannot change and two slots for counters you can buy equipment to change those counters but most of the equipment needs to be unlocked first usually by killing specific rares in tanaan since you cannot reroll a crew you can decommision a ship and make another to try for a specific crew the best ones are the ones that increase success chances and the gold finders
wow,not_removed,he asked for options i gave them to him
wow,not_removed,vendor everything but the boes you can ah some of those for an increased value
wow,not_removed,dont bother you wont have time to get the treasure hunters all leveled before the prepatch hits in another months the best bet is cata raids and daily professions
wow,not_removed,on my realm i can cruise from lfr to lfr healing on my druid make about gold with the satchel and a chance at medallion best ones to do are heroics blackhand and imperators rise since theyre so quick
wow,not_removed,i think he meant you should buy a token and sell it for gold
wow,not_removed,thats why i myself am just dipping my god in the water with flipping wod mats theyre cheap theres a lot of them and s single duck up wont financially ruin you make a group for the mats youre interested in true iron ore nagrabd arrow bloom etc and a buysell operation make your minimum price about of market price and your maximum buy any auction of a mat thats less than of market price and relish it tedious but steady easy gold
wow,not_removed,also if you have supreme mark of doom potion of treasure finding or luck whatever the cata one is and a class with strong aoe decent ilvl you can pull of the trash in firelands wipe them times an hour and leave with a huge haul of loot and reagents i know the volatile stuff still sells well on my server i was doing that once a week for about a month before getting bored of it though
wow,not_removed,hc firlands took me min and gave me around with everything sold
wow,not_removed,each one on its own is actually gold on all cata raids together are though
wow,not_removed,how much does the ghost iron ore go for i mean you could buy them with spirit of harmonys if they arent that costly thats what i did atleast
wow,not_removed,just to add if youre going for dwarfgoblin crews itd probably be more effective to decommission a ship and build a new one to get them to proc especially if youre doing the tanaan assaults daily
wow,not_removed,zed is correct it honestly doesnt take that long to set it up really the full amount of treasure hunters does however you dont need a full amount only a few due to the general lack of gold missions yes cata raids are the best bet but alone they are not enough to cover the token unfortunately probably depending on whether you are eu or us of course i know that the eu token is currently edit saw his edit cata raids may be enough then but it doesnt take very long to level a follower to depending on how far through you are in general mine tend to take about days to level to if you keep up with the missions good luck
wow,not_removed,mostly not a lot of people mistakenly think they can just sell every ugly purple or blue boe for a large amount but for most that isnt the case and they get undercut by everyone else selling it for like less
wow,not_removed,no i do not think so
wow,not_removed,are you looting all the mobs or just bosses because ive been running them every week the past months and never got less than
wow,not_removed,better to just sell the spirits outright spirits go between each on my server ghost iron ore has been going around each edit ghost iron is also really easy to farm with realm hopping but i suppose thats true for wod herbs and ore also
wow,not_removed,is a fine haul for a single boe thats a raise for the hours work
wow,not_removed,i dont do all the trash mainly because i dont have that much time but i do loot everything i kill
wow,not_removed,go to the demon hunter subreddit theres a couple pinned posts and faqs about the min meta build and if you cant find it there then just ask and im sure someone can help you
wow,not_removed,do you know what its called
wow,not_removed,ok perfect that will help me with the math to figure out with what i have if it is possible
wow,not_removed,its called the fel hammer i believe its on the sidebar of this sub elzewise im sure a google search will turn it up sorry i cant provide the link on mobile atm
wow,not_removed,deleted cause i was wrong its per fury regardless of if it was spent by one ability or several
wow,not_removed,thanks at least with the name i can look it up
wow,not_removed,thanks for the update if it is just for every fury spent and not all at once that makes the minute meta much easier to hit
wow,not_removed,thank you for the gold making tip
wow,not_removed,hah jokes on you my guild cant down nighthold the first week so ill have to wait d
wow,not_removed,im going to make dozens of gold from this
wow,not_removed,righteous tip cant wait to spend my bonus gold seals
wow,not_removed,what will be the ilevel requirements for normal nighthold
wow,not_removed,meanwhile the ilvl of lfr gear will probably be or something lol
wow,not_removed,dont trust that order hall mission failed it with bonus chance
wow,not_removed,nice method to get gold
wow,not_removed,can you complete this weeks timewalking quests objectives and then not turn it in until that week or will the quest disappearnot be able to be turned in on later weeks
wow,not_removed,wont they change what seals you use for nighthold since its a new tier
wow,not_removed,i assume heroic opens week i guess i will be coining for tier or perfectly optimised pieces but ill be saving most for the first bosses of mythic
wow,not_removed,fun detected
wow,not_removed,seals and every will be loot so you might get items wow also people that cant figure this out them self dont deserve loot
wow,not_removed,actually right now on ptr you get artifact power from bonus rolls
wow,not_removed,truth
wow,not_removed,pug life i wont know my chances until i see the dps meter on the first pull
wow,not_removed,mine could if we went to normal but i know were going straight to heroic so maybe bosses down well see how tough it is
wow,not_removed,according to people making groups right now probably
wow,not_removed,a good rule of thumb is by subtracting from what drops to determine what you need to kill it in general
wow,not_removed,a good rule of thumb is by subtracting from what drops to determine what you need to kill it in general
wow,not_removed,lfr shouldnt even exist in the first place
wow,not_removed,obfuscated rounding nice meme blizzard
wow,not_removed,that means you didnt counter the cursed effect which prevents you from getting bonus loot no matter the chance to get it
wow,not_removed,really any proof
wow,not_removed,i failed it with yesterday i thought to my self oh this would never fail i shouldnt need to squeeze the extra little did i know
wow,not_removed,afaik if you dont counter every threat you can still fail a mission even with
wow,not_removed,if you do not turn in the quest for this weeks timewalking event before the event is over it will be removed from your log
wow,not_removed,that is a very good question i do not know if someone who does know can comment and get this question answered that would be great
wow,not_removed,he did say after you spent
wow,not_removed,it isnt a new tier its still the first tier if the expansion
wow,not_removed,nighthold isnt a new tier its tier same as the emerald nightmare
wow,not_removed,tier bonuss are a huge boost for some people and if you burn all your coins you have two three weeks to get back to full coins for mythic just plan accordingly
wow,not_removed,cant just say it to just say it
wow,not_removed,how is new items from just rolls not awesome for the first week of heroics thats huge
wow,not_removed,really awesome what sort of quantity are we talking accounting for ak something like the warden manacles seem reasonable
wow,not_removed,just in time for me to have gotten my point
wow,not_removed,if i see im top of the meters then god help us all
wow,not_removed,why not do normal on the first night and fly through it to see the fights thats what we did for en
wow,not_removed,any raid guild will clear it first night
wow,not_removed,you have aotc guldan right
wow,not_removed,it really bothers me how that might be a real thing by summer
wow,not_removed,you mean add gives loot people require to run it lol
wow,not_removed,hot take
wow,not_removed,sorry not everyone is epic edgy mythic raiders
wow,not_removed,that effect just caps the mission at it would be impossible to have a maxed chance to bonus loot if this wasnt countered
wow,not_removed,seems like it might be a nice idea to put the bonus chance at if its not going to complete then
wow,not_removed,this is absolute bullshit right here i failed the bonus with chance if you dont counter cursed you cant even get above
wow,not_removed,you must not have been here for the garrison shipyard
wow,not_removed,if it isnt it might as well be
wow,not_removed,blizzard logic regarding bonus rolls chance maybe
wow,not_removed,im not saying its impossible but ive never heard of it happening or seen it i often leave time or cost not countered to reach the
wow,not_removed,completely irrelevant but i had a success chance on a garrison mission back in wod dont know why i carried it out and was successful
wow,not_removed,pretty sure the weekly quests disappear i didnt complete the arena one a few weeks back and its been gone since then from my quest log and since those quests are similar im guessing the same will happen to the timewalking quest
wow,not_removed,weekly quests disappear when the event is over
wow,not_removed,yeah my bad pretty late here and im not seeing things oo
wow,not_removed,yeah that could easily be a you otherwise wouldve missed
wow,not_removed,probably with no ak bonus
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,its a talisman drop
wow,not_removed,progress guilds will do heroic first and normal afterwards because the other way arround someone could get an upgrade from normal and an even better one from heroic afterwards wasting the first one which could have been given to someone else edit to clarify thats in a scenario with a guild that does both heroic and normal
wow,not_removed,a normal clear takes up raid time and might prevent you from clearing the full raid on heroic you often have to relearn the fight on heroic anyway because people will massively outgear the normal version and blow past the most difficult parts of the fight without learning proper execution my guild usually does optional normal runs on an off night for the first weeks of a raid tier to help people get the pieces they need but i dont think its worth using normal raid times for it unless you arent expecting to clear heroic anyway
wow,not_removed,cause normal doesnt offer us much anything over our mythic en gear rather just start heroic which is what we also did with en edit people seem butthurt that were not doing normal
wow,not_removed,well if we get a new raid we probably will start looking for
wow,not_removed,and considering last i saw the ilevel difference between lfr and normal is increasing from to for nighthold nobodys going to be able to go from lfr to normal without going back to emerald nightmare but nobodys going to want anyone for their epic legendary en farmfests who doesnt have nighthold heroic gear
wow,not_removed,thats for m where you are more generously rewarded for surpassing the contents difficulty different rules apply to raids especially when they are new pugs will probably still require you to be overgeared pretty soon after it comes out but are generally more forgiving for brand new content
wow,not_removed,not edgy lol its a stupid system to gift bad players welfare epics and chance to proc a mythiclike item it also doesnt motivate players to strive to raid
wow,not_removed,nobody in lfr is a raider period
wow,not_removed,the app version didnt show that it was capped for quite some time probably still doesnt
wow,not_removed,they do
wow,not_removed,mission failed epic ships lost every time
wow,not_removed,nah i hated garrison content from wod i tried to avoid it as much as i could
wow,not_removed,if its one of the cross swords ones even at you can fail the entire mission
wow,not_removed,its actually only but supplemented with to make up for it
wow,not_removed,this time around tier tokens are in the balance so it may still be worth doing it normal hero to ease up the heroic clears a bit eventually freeing up more time for alt raids or whatnot
wow,not_removed,a normal clear took us hour on opening night in gear i still think its better to run normal on the first night and fly through it maybe get a couple trinkets or tier set for your top dps and then start heroic
wow,not_removed,set bonuses op trinkets more chances at new legendaries fight knowledge think any serious team will be clearing out normal that first week i guess if you cared about heroic ranks or had a very limited schedule you might skip normal
wow,not_removed,im pretty sure some of the trinkets from normal will still be better than anything you have right now i know im salivating over convergence of fates as a rogue
wow,not_removed,we absolutely will we still have major patch cycles to get through after nighthold
wow,not_removed,whenever i filter for groups the only results tend to be helya hc waitlist and forming boost group good legendaries and traits required checking wowprogress groups and youre saying you insta fill en normal raid groups
wow,not_removed,funny considering doing lfr has a chance for a legendary and most guilds are doing it even top end guilds
wow,not_removed,lol if i wasnt broke as fuck id give you gold
wow,not_removed,the app has been showing it capped for a long time now in fact ive never seen it not work but i started a couple weeks late
wow,not_removed,i am so glad i quit that shitshow of an expansion after months and only came back so late that you could guarantuee your ships wouldnt think god wod was awful
wow,not_removed,damn really failed at ive had shipyard missions fail in the range but not that sucks
wow,not_removed,garrison content
wow,not_removed,im not convinced this is right i was reading that the reason you sometimes fail is because the display is rounding up a decimal value it could be chance but displays this could happen with any but its highly unlikely i know ive yet to fail one and i doubt many people have
wow,not_removed,if you dont counter the successchance reduction im almost certain it is impossible to even reach chance
wow,not_removed,oh shit thanks blizz i did need something to cover repairing my bracers
wow,not_removed,thats what i was thinking why not do normal as well for the chance of set pieces regardless of a minor ilvl downgrade id take an tier piece over an mythic en piece i dont know the ilvl from nh havent kept up just saying because of what a guildie rolled the other night from en especially if you can get set pieces to get the bonus rolling now youve got double the chances of getting a set bonus going if you ran normal one set from normal one from heroic id rather have chances to at least get a set going rather than fuck the ilvl
wow,not_removed,well depends on how serious you mean semiserious like guilds that rank lower worse than world sure they will probably do a quick normal beforehand give or take ranks either way but my guess is that a lot of guilds that rank higher than world top will jump straight into heroic just to stay super competitive chances are they have already cleared it on ptr any ways
wow,not_removed,eh well get there on heroic we just do normal with alts or whoever wants to come on off nights
wow,not_removed,if he instafills it it wouldnt contradict your statement if he instafills it it would not remain in the premade finder for very long at all
wow,not_removed,and you can get legendaries from doing wq that involve chasing squirrels or jumping in barrels whats your point
wow,not_removed,picking herbs has a chance for a legendary too that doesnt mean much and lol no at your last two claims
wow,not_removed,you can not lead your ships to water but you can never make them not think
wow,not_removed,the changed the internal numbers at some point and dramatically decreased the chance a ship would be destroyed before that tweak you could almost count on anything below to fail for sure personal theory is that chances to fail were individually calculated for each ship and then added resulting in a failure chance with ships either way they fixed it and it got better still always go if you really want what the mission gives
wow,not_removed,more like nontent hayyyyy
wow,not_removed,with the right equipment you can sometimes
wow,not_removed,not on a really low mission with decked followers
wow,not_removed,seems to vary a lot sometimes successchance reduction is like other times just or
wow,not_removed,those guilds probably dont give a rats ass about heroic guild ranks they will probably clear normal just for the tier tokens trinkets especially when considering they can warforge titanforge
wow,not_removed,its worth it for set pieces alone
wow,not_removed,right now on eu pm kinda prime time for no lifers theres no raid group for and only two dungeon groups my theoretical ilvl is so i still need a small upgrade to see these elusive groups lol pretty much every mythic raider and people living in maw got by now doesnt take long to find a full group for dungeons still not convinced by normal raids though p even random pugs kills most en hc bosses in minutes
wow,not_removed,no it doesnt
wow,not_removed,are you trying to be poetic if not towards the end of the expansion there was some sort of system in place that made your ships be unsinkable if you managed to get at least maybe the number isnt important if you passed a certain chance your ships couldnt sink anymore
wow,not_removed,think they also fixed that anything above would not destroy any ships
wow,not_removed,no
wow,not_removed,hes commenting on your previous post about ships not thinking

wow,not_removed,oh shit im sick alright d im spending new years eve in bed because of shit like this
wow,not_removed,it should but i cant tell you till character copy is enabled as theyve noted itll only be for stuff you can use on the character that did the quest so if you played shaman and did a quest then youre only getting mailmacesshieldsetc and not the cloth appearances unlocked
wow,not_removed,they definitely keep track of those old quests the have their internal quest ids and you can still check the completion status of them with a script command i dont know if they will be added as well though but its definitely possible
wow,not_removed,they said at blizzcon that they were planning on adding those rewards but that it might be buggy at first so dont toss anything you want to keep i guess
wow,not_removed,they originally said and implemented it as such that you got all gear rewards from completed quests including items you didnt select inclusive of old world quests as of the latest update theyd changed it to only give the selected rewards for quests
wow,not_removed,they are infinitely better than i expected i love how they are unique to each class have their own charms and lore behind them also vanessa
wow,not_removed,i dont know of a single person who says you know what i hate my class hall it sucks and has no relevance to anything my favorites druid because fuck its a class hall that teleports you to places using the emerald portals fuck way to take a thing that has existed since vanilla and make it relevant paladin imagine a secret underground base that was referenced at the beginning of wotlk where every paladin in azeroth gathers for the sole purpose of kicking ass it has a staunch militaristic feel to it
wow,not_removed,hunter class hall is pretty much exactly how i envisionedhoped it would be it looks great and super thematic imo d
wow,not_removed,i think its great how theyre all unique they feel important the missions are useful but its not mandatory to queue fifty of them and you dont have a reason to stay there all day followers are actual characters everything is tied into your class fantasy its relevant without being mandatory i might be biased because i get the maelstrom but theyre great
wow,not_removed,rogue class hall likes aestehetics lore vanessa dislikes garrison missions the way i got leadership of the order
wow,not_removed,theyre really just glorified garrisons when it really comes down to it but i dont necessarily have any complaints so far visually theyre fucking amazing
wow,not_removed,so happy with the warlock order hall really appreciated the way we got our class order hall as well seemed really fitting that the warlocks decide to dominate everything we can
wow,not_removed,i really like them i also like the campaigns i have only played my dk so far but i can imagine the class quests being entirely different for everyone the ones i had to do so far were amazing and im really overall satisfied with how personal it got made every class is different you really get that feeling now dk already got a class hall that existed though acherus but you rarely even were there only when you got a new weapon that you needed to put an enchant on
wow,not_removed,i absolutely love the paladin class hall lots of familiar names walking around the place lots of races united under one cause looks epic and everything about it just feels right for the class fantasy and other stuff that is tough to pinpoint but just by being there it actually makes me feel like we really are about to unleash an almighty crusade against the legion
wow,not_removed,i wasted more time than i shouldve on the wandering isle so far its great to be back there
wow,not_removed,rogue class hall is exactly as sketchy and seedy as i was hoping plus its in dalaran so getting back and forth is easy while questing
wow,not_removed,i just posted about this in another thread but i gotta speak up for the monk class hall i expected to be disappointed i mean weve seen the wandering isle before and pandaren aesthetics are old news as far as i was concerned but the people there are what make it you cant walk past a building without an npc encouraging you to come in for food and rest and when you go inside people are drinking and singing yet its still wonderfully peaceful i understand the aesthetic is not for everyone but i love it and i think it perfectly suits what monks are about
wow,not_removed,i knew it was coming but still disappointed with the warrior classhall have had nothing to do with vrykul for a few expansions and suddenly you are the boss of their afterlife
wow,not_removed,and then theres dhs who get a fucking spaceship
wow,not_removed,with the paladin hall i really enjoy the feel that weve united the racial orders under one roof silver hand blood knights sunwalkers and vindicators all fighting side by side i know in lore paladins have usually been among the first to put aside racial barriers argent dawn shattered sun etc but the atmosphere of the hall really makes it sink in
wow,not_removed,ive heard people complain about hunters in comparison to say dh or paladin in terms of scope but i love the hunter base its rustic and simple and the atmosphere is wonderful
wow,not_removed,shamans get the maelstrom nice
wow,not_removed,vanessa deserves like likes i fangirled hard
wow,not_removed,theyre garrisons done right
wow,not_removed,theyre not really garrisons at all though the only way they compare to garrisons is with missions and followers and its a very toneddown refined version of that system
wow,not_removed,therere the opposite of glorified really they are garrisons toned down to just been a cool side place you go to do some stuff then leave
wow,not_removed,i was just sad when i ran up to the frost trainer to say hi i like that lich a lot and he basically told me to fuck off overall it was nice to see it got cleaned up a bit but its still not quite as shiny as the others ive seen
wow,not_removed,if dk is the only one youve done you should enjoy the others then if you ever get to them i expected acherus like it makes sense but probably the most dispointing of the ones ive done because it wasnt new shiny and exciting
wow,not_removed,as i had mentioned in my post i am still trying to decide on my class and my big options are balance druid cool artifact cool class hall dislike cast times enhancement shaman cool class hall and artifact but already so many melee and prot paladin cool class hall truth guard is the coolest design of an artifact imo but i have never tanked and the thought of failure terrifies me do you know anything about tanking becuase the talk of embarking of a crusade makes me want to roll paladin
wow,not_removed,im doing warrior now and like oh god the voice acting odyn especially is awful
wow,not_removed,agreed i like it because i like norse mythology but as the warrior class hall its awful nothing about it screams wow warrior to me
wow,not_removed,hell yeah its like hey you know how we are all paladins lets fucking act like it
wow,not_removed,to be fair i havent even seen any of the other halls yet anyway i do love the two gnomes out the front that discuss how awesome it is that gnomes can finally be hunters though xd
wow,not_removed,they absolutely nailed it for us everything about it is great
wow,not_removed,agreed
wow,not_removed,i feel the same way i was almost hoping for a wing in the ice crown citadel seeing as the new litch king is on our side but i knew that was a bit much
wow,not_removed,you could be out of luck then if you go for paladin and decide tanking isnt for you unless youd consider switching to one of the other specs youd definitely like the hall though maybe give prot a go and if you really hate tanking then go for one of the other classes instead i cant on the others though ive only ever really played the one class with any seriousness and even then mainly ret although i have promised myself this expansion i will learn a secondary spec probably prot
wow,not_removed,xd yeah also ive done a couple and i love the hunter one and i think it fits fine not all the classes are focused on being heroes of the world or slayers of legion
wow,not_removed,all the previous expansions legion yes meta for what raiding tanking healing the major ones well we have an undead person leading us voljin and hellscream died
wow,not_removed,the game has a free trial and offers a full upgrade for if you level to in it this will include everything up to level legion gives you a huge new expansion and access to level stuff and the new demon hunter class every class and spec is now viable for raiding to within about of each other overall pandas also warcraft references
wow,not_removed,btw dont forget the web version of the auction house httpsusbattlenetwowenvaultcharacterauctionauctions
wow,not_removed,coming from a warlock play anything but a warlock
wow,not_removed,everything is much easier now than it was in
wow,not_removed,blizzard have it against mages classic case of new exp new class op for months and months and months and
wow,not_removed,skorp tab targetting is fun scorpions in combat at yards distance let me go ahead and target all the scorpions on the edge of the room completely fucks me up as a melee expecially since im not used to clicking targets
wow,not_removed,tab is broken blizzard is suppose to help us in but no release date on that currently
wow,not_removed,press v or if it was shift v to enable health bars in combat then click the bars manually a bit counterintuitive but its basicly the alternative you have
wow,not_removed,id suggest target on hold scan its what i use on my controller for wow works rather well theres few youtube vids of how it works to
wow,not_removed,imagine what it does to ranged that could accidently pull the ones on the edge
wow,not_removed,it also makes life dramatically easier in dungeons when basic mob abilities start becoming raid mechanics
wow,not_removed,hmm sounds interesting i might try that
wow,not_removed,i think you can only body pull them otherwise it would have happened to me many times
wow,not_removed,hello there bolstering
wow,not_removed,pretty much
wow,not_removed,great video anyone with half a peanut in their head would be able to see the sarcasm in this title reading these comments has actually made me less intelligent thank you internet you have done your job for the day
wow,not_removed,omg this can be done with any buffsdebuffs monks serenity and fortifying brew comes to my mind pretrinketing is now also a thing
wow,not_removed,is bugged helpfull bug report right there realy goes into details about what the bug is and how it can be replicated so that they can try it and fix it
wow,not_removed,this is a joke right this isnt how people are getting double during a fight nobody waits minutes per pull you reset the boss with active without entering voidform and the cooldown on resets pull the boss when he respawns and you have minutes left on your get rezzed immediately when you die and go right back into disclaimer i dont play a shadow priest this is just how it was explained to me personally i think was a stupid idea to begin with and should never have been implemented blizzard shot themselves in the foot with with how badly this talent trivializes mythic en i fully expect it to be removed from the game in the next months and en to receive significant nerfs as a result
wow,not_removed,in case anyone didnt realize it hes not actually doing million dps hes attacking lower level dummies so his damage is amped up
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,that is for video he did not submit it
wow,not_removed,you have to wonder how much garbage is littered around those support tickets queues
wow,not_removed,en absolutely doesnt need nerfs shadow priests definitely contributed to the instance being destroyed but it would have happened without them top mythic guilds would absolutely wait minutes per pull if it meant that their single shadow priest was effectively doing the damage of four dps and even more so if they had two or three shadow priests this could trivialize every dps race or mechanic in so many bosses its insane
wow,not_removed,i was under the impression it reset when you reset the boss sounds like im wrong either way this really should get fixed
wow,not_removed,get rezzed immediately when you die doesnt leave a debuff that prevents you from being battlerezed or does this exploit somehow get around that too
wow,not_removed,he put that in the description
wow,not_removed,can a shadow priest twice on xavius if so that explains how my guilds shadow priest is easily doubling my dps
wow,not_removed,does everything on reddit need s for people to tell if its sarcasm or not
wow,not_removed,heh i actually didnt notice thanks
wow,not_removed,it works only in rested areas tho where you can logout instantly
wow,not_removed,didnt notice that thanks for the correction
wow,not_removed,im not saying they wouldnt do it guilds absolutely have in the past but rather that as far as im aware its not necessary and you can achieve the exact same result by just resetting the boss
wow,not_removed,haha for real definitely done way more crazy shit than waiting minutes per pull
wow,not_removed,the debuff last minutes and applies when you start if you wait a bit before you pull you can time it so that the debuff falls off shortly after you die
wow,not_removed,yes they can in the dream and when they die they just get taken out and can again for the final
wow,not_removed,yes if you in the dream provided you die before youre forcefully removed from the dream you can when youre no longer in the dream ive done it on my spriest
wow,not_removed,would it be possible if they end up in the dream
wow,not_removed,can a shadow priest twice on xavius if you hold until you get dream simulacrum yes you can also benefit from the damage corruption descent into madness grants while dreaming
wow,not_removed,the waiting ten minutes part is why this bug works if youre logged off the minute cooldown of the spell ticks down but the debuff that states you are in surrender does not you wait for the debuff to tick down to half its duration so that by the time you die in surrender you can be battle rezed and because you waited ten minutes you can pop it immediately again
wow,not_removed,do you have to use cds when in dream form to have them reset when you exit or you can use them before
wow,not_removed,every player gets in the dream at least once it selects half the raid each time and a debuff prevents you from getting it twice
wow,not_removed,yes its exactly like saying that now think one step further and wonder what that could mean
wow,not_removed,the waiting ten minutes part is why this bug works except it isnt required at all because pulling and resetting the boss will reset your cooldown without removing your buff you wait for the debuff to tick down to half its duration so that by the time you die in surrender you can be battle rezed and because you waited ten minutes you can pop it immediately again alternatively you can just pull the boss when you have minutes left on your buff and do what i described above to have off cooldown and ready for use as soon as youre rezzed
wow,not_removed,what about heroismbloodlust if you can reset the boss will popping bloodlust then pulling and reseting the boss leave you with the bloodlust buff but not the sated debuff allowing double heroism well one and a half heroisms maybe
wow,not_removed,if the boss cooldown reset works on surrender then the op was only using the log off to demonstrate for the video because you cannot reset a dummy
wow,not_removed,yup ive lost a lot of dps this way when i forget and pop my cooldowns on pull i get put into the dream immediately and when i come out of the dream all my cooldowns are reset to where they were when i started dreaming with another min seconds to go before theyre off cooldown
wow,not_removed,well i dont know how but i managed to sneak trueshots in a normal xavius fight by popping cds on pool anyways so im preeetty happy the way it went p
wow,not_removed,bosses take longer to respawn than the buff from bloodlust lasts
wow,not_removed,makes sense thanks
wow,not_removed,yah but it is slower because you run into some stuff
wow,not_removed,what is the point of this post do you think people have trouble remembering which direction to walk in a place they have most likely visited multiple times each day since legion came out
wow,not_removed,what
wow,not_removed,i dont understand maybe im missing a meme
wow,not_removed,and dont ignore the screech emotes
wow,not_removed,druids when you enter the emerald dreamway portal place if you walk without changing character direction you will always be in the dreamgrove direction portal to class hall
wow,not_removed,no rest zone at the start of the raids want to change talents take the time hit or craft the consumable tome thats the trade off
wow,not_removed,there are two items that can be made by a scribe one is a consumable that gives you a minute long buff that while not in combat allows you to change them the other is a time that can be placed on the ground that allows everyone near it to change talents
wow,not_removed,someone else mentioned the tomes already but on your last point blizzard has said that if you dont have any talent in a tier you should be able to select one regardless of rested area or tome so if for instance you hit level in the middle of a dungeon you should be able to select a talent though if you select wrong youll need either one of the items or youll need to go back to an inn
wow,not_removed,that guy who said hold onit might take me half an hour but i got this was so ready for his time to shine props to you man
wow,not_removed,listening to starboy on auger priceless
wow,not_removed,nah thats just enrage s
wow,not_removed,that fight looks so cool
wow,not_removed,really weird bug on an unrelated note what addon do you use to get your name plates and chat bubbles to look like that it looks really slick
wow,not_removed,im more interested in how he got his camera to zoom out that far max cam doesnt even come close to that
wow,not_removed,i laughed the most at spell auger d its star augur mate d
wow,not_removed,do you have logs for this if so could you add on to this bug report it looks like its the same bug on a different spell we had augur freak out on void nova spam casting canceling it for about a minute until he got to casting a meteor on the tank
wow,not_removed,i dont blame asmongold for not getting in his guild voip they sound like they are all and everything is fucking hilarious i mean its good theyre having fun and all but damn
wow,not_removed,thats not a bug its a soft enrage
wow,not_removed,that would have been me bruldan the chosen
wow,not_removed,i think we got every single enrage available on the server
wow,not_removed,i think this is all part of elvui i never figured out how to create this get this without having to use the whole elvui package
wow,not_removed,we are using kui nameplates and nameplate auras in the above video helps keep things tidy
wow,not_removed,i use kui nameplates and just elvui for the chat bubbles to set up the chat bubbles go to general chat bubbles tab on top and change the drop down menu in chat bubbles style to remove backdrop
wow,not_removed,all i did was console cameradistancemaxzoomfactor
wow,not_removed,we always call him ster augurk dutch for star pickle
wow,not_removed,ah whatever i dont respect him enough to remember his name
wow,not_removed,he aint drilling holes through space hes divining the starts
wow,not_removed,will post them there thanks for the heads up
wow,not_removed,hate to break it to you but thats just a details nickname much like cum back kid and todd
wow,not_removed,did you even watch the video
wow,not_removed,that feel when youre solo dpsing the boss for seconds but you still cant break top on the charts
wow,not_removed,that was your moment bruldan you were the chosen but alas it was not your time the worldof warcraft was not ready to witness your greatness yet
wow,not_removed,our raid calls him star ogre
wow,not_removed,thanks this is definitely the same bug it has the same initial condition an interrupted grand conjunction and ends with the same event several successful casts of gravitational pull in a row looks like it might be related to weird targeting states during grand conjunction both of our rogues had just used one of their vanish abilities vanish in yours cloak in ours during a grand conjunction cast
wow,not_removed,i mean unless others died at dips in dps and you have cooldowns coming up youre not going to beat them by fighting longer if you werent already beating them
wow,not_removed,theres always next time right
wow,not_removed,starboy is what we call him
wow,not_removed,nobody has their meters set to plain dps everyone uses damage done
wow,not_removed,mate everyone looks at damage done i said that he continued to dps the boss for seconds which is seconds of additional damage that the dead people arent adding to their damage done on the charts simple stuff here
wow,not_removed,so do i but the way said implied dps though its merely vague than specific
wow,not_removed,well it also depends on your addon with details your dps continues to drop even after you die which is how it should be
wow,not_removed,true actually i dont like that meters average dps over the entire fight anyway even skadarecount will if you get bressed and start attacking again i think they should show damage and then in brackets the dps for the last idk seconds or somewhere around that that way you can see how people are doing at given points in time while still seeing who has done the most damage overall can details do that
wow,not_removed,not sure if details can do that but i know if youre interested in instantaneous dps you can find that on warcraft logs instantaneous dps is weird though since a lot of classes have highs and lows versus classes with smooth sustained damage curves
wow,not_removed,dps for the last idk seconds would not be accurate because then classes with execute like abilities would have an inflated dps
wow,not_removed,for about seconds yeah you could see the spikes and dips in realtime and track your actual dps to see how well you executed longcooldown number whatever in the fight i think it would be a lot more interesting to see and im a class that would be negatively affected by not averaging because of how combustion works
wow,not_removed,thats my point he said he wanted the dps charts to show the dps from the last seconds instead of the whole fight so everyclass with an execute would have an inflated dps in comparison to the rest as they probably did more dps when the boss was about to die which is only one fragment of the whole encounter and not a good indicator of their whole performance during that fight
wow,not_removed,i am my emissary chest always gives me loot occasionally it can titanforgewarforge also no point in saving your chest as the moment you get it loot has already been determined just you do not know the loot until you open it
wow,not_removed,the loot is already decided once you get the chest same with artifact power once you already have it you cant increase it by getting ak
wow,not_removed,if i save my emissary chests to open once the new legendaries drop will they have a chance to yield one of the new ones or will they be locked in to old loot
wow,not_removed,this is wrong you will get a random piece of loot the moment you open it the only thing that is locked is the accompanying ap which is based on the ak you got when you finished the emissary quest the loot within is base i think and increases to once you cross that threshhold and further increases to and once you cross those too so to answer ops question yes you could save the emissary cache for when you have geared up through some heroics
wow,not_removed,no it isnt they may look like chests but they arent they are tokens that randomly generate loot once activated
wow,not_removed,the chests are the exact same as lockboxes from old expansions they generate as soon as they are opened also emissary chests have no special minimum everyone gets unless it procs
wow,not_removed,this is what i want to know i already have banked
wow,not_removed,nobody knows for sure when you open them on the ptr with your char they can drop new items people have actually done that with a huge bank of items saved up and noticed that what actually dropped in them was different from live but we dont know whether that is because the loot is determined on opening or because the loot is redetermined because a character that is copied to the ptr is like creating a new char and giving it new emissary caches that reroll whatever drops in them
wow,not_removed,is max base lvl for emissary chests from there is just war or titanforge
wow,not_removed,no the highest base you can get out of an emissary chest is for what ever reason blizzard decided to not have that gear scale to or just completely forgot about it in its not like it actually affect me but this decision or oversight makes zero sense so we can do quest for an ilvl piece of gear but when we do four of those quest to get a chest the reward is actually worse
wow,not_removed,im i usually get my best so far has been an and ive done every chest id like to see more interesting items maybe unique models or old models anything thats not the same stupid leather belt over and over lol
wow,not_removed,i have no idea what this comment means in full but for the last part for all intents and purposes the loot is predetermined you just dont know what it is until you click it theres no point arguing the semantics when the end result is the same ilvl occams razor basically
wow,not_removed,is max base lvl for emissarys
wow,not_removed,the misinformation in this thread is hilarious my first emissary chest provided me with a blue because of my ilvl its based on your ilvl band just like world quests are and then it caps at the mark with chance to forge
wow,not_removed,opened my chest i stand corrected thanks
wow,not_removed,this is the reason ive stopped with emissary caches in general ive gotten both of my legendaries both not good from mythic and since im sitting at theres just no point imo to waste time walking around for the hopes of an piece to roll tf to even be worth looking at content my ass
wow,not_removed,the original response said that the loot is determined the moment you get the chest which is wrong copy your char twice to the ptr and see for yourself i was wrong in overestimating the base limit the cache loot can scale to which i admitted is not
wow,not_removed,so if you turned in emissary quest as holy and opened as shadow spec you get holy loot
wow,not_removed,well the first part of my comment is correct
wow,not_removed,my legendaries both came from caches so i keep doing them
wow,not_removed,this whole expansion ive been getting class specific items from the chests not spec specific ive gotten a intellect trinket with my lootspec set to retribution for example when it comes to legendaries however then im not sure perhaps when you get the chest its already marked to give a legendary once you open it and that legendary will be changed according to your lootspec anyway just my cent
wow,not_removed,i dont know how it is with other gear but this has happened to me with relics turned in the emissary as shadow loot spec set to shadow and i get relics that can only go in the disc or holy weapon
wow,not_removed,you will not get a tanking trinket if you never set your loot to tank spec they will just never show up works like this with chests
wow,not_removed,that is wrong all this expansion ive been windwalker loot spec and just the other day i got an int trinket from a chest
wow,not_removed,theyve said loads of times they wont balance for or even id just love some mobility outside of body and soul i know your pain though my priest died last night when a dk looked at me
wow,not_removed,i dont get how the conversation turned to being confused about girls
wow,not_removed,hey its me your son
wow,not_removed,my son has been complaining about low fps and lag so for his bday he upgraded his video card and then for christmas he got an ssd and i installed it last night i may have had a bit to drink tonight and then decided to play wow i look on my bnet friends list and see him playing overwatch his real name is similar to my toon name with that being said i also have made friends with a person who has the exact same toon name on wow as me we used to be mortal enemies back in bc with that being said i thought i clicked on my sons name and the above conversation ensued
wow,not_removed,can i be your son could use on my gtx
wow,not_removed,what has happend
wow,not_removed,how is this related to world of warcraft
wow,not_removed,im wondering how some people still confuse lag and stuttering you wont fix lag with a better pc at all you cant influence your connection with better computer hardware
wow,not_removed,this is brilliant
wow,not_removed,you bought him a and an ssd jeezus hi its me your son please send pc parts
wow,not_removed,your letters look on my phone lol
wow,not_removed,thats great
wow,not_removed,when am i getting a geforce am like a son to you
wow,not_removed,were waiting
wow,not_removed,broken arms
wow,not_removed,lmao comedy edit wait i legitimately thought this was hilarious
wow,not_removed,he wants to take a new girl out tomorrow night and we had just talked about it sorry i left that part out
wow,not_removed,this is what i came here to say
wow,not_removed,from the timestamp in the conversation there was a pause of seconds before the i am confused part so i assume op took it like a different topic began
wow,not_removed,my lag and fps are really bad can you send me a new gpu and ssd
wow,not_removed,just so you know no amount of hardware will help reducing lag except using a wire rather than wifi edit nice downvotes just trying to dispel a very common myth apparently when enough people confuse terms it becomes ok to just spout nonsense
wow,not_removed,with that being said you really like the saying with that being said huh you use it twice in the same sentence
wow,not_removed,yeah im up for adoption
wow,not_removed,i bought myself a for christmas and i gotta say the difference is night and day so if youre of a mind save up and buy it
wow,not_removed,conversation happened in wow other than that nothing
wow,not_removed,thats because you guys still arent using discord
wow,not_removed,and girls
wow,not_removed,i know a lot of people who think lag is the same as low fps so probably his son was complaining about graphic lag
wow,not_removed,unfortunately while the word lag in a technical context is generally thought to mean network latency laymen cannot be expected to make the clear distinction between osi layers when discussing performance issues and every stutter or visibly slow process will be described as lagging since thats what the verb to lag means
wow,not_removed,i think hes talking about fps lag i would assume he is intelligent enough to realise a ssd and gpu wont increase your broadband speed
wow,not_removed,he was probably referencing video card choppyness as lag
wow,not_removed,i may or may not have had a drink or two when typing the above sentence with that being said yeah i probably do
wow,not_removed,im so confused
wow,not_removed,low fps doesnt even have anything to do with osi layers if your game stutters it has nothing to do with your network some bad games might be programmed in a way that if you have connection issues the whole game freezes but any serious game uses some kind of interpolation or lag compensation for that so you cant see every little network problem ingame
wow,not_removed,they upgraded the gpu on his birthday and gave him an ssd for christmas unless they made him wait the gpu was likely already installed meaning the ssd was the only new part an ssd wont increase the fps or reduce latency so it really doesnt matter what they meant by lag unless they meant initial character loading upon login
wow,not_removed,there is no such thing as fps lag does your car suffers from mph lag when you slow down
wow,not_removed,i know what you mean but fps lag is not lag
wow,not_removed,no the only reason is because it is far more stable faster and doesnt affect anyone else why spend a lot of money on an expensive router when you might as well pull an ethernet cable that is much less expensive and faster in every way your wifi will never be better than ethernet
wow,not_removed,with that being said i dont see a problem with saying with that being said a lot all things considered
wow,not_removed,unless youre streaming the game but if were going to nitpick every edge case well be here all day i threw osi in there because its the only standardized abstraction model i could think of and im lazy but youre right osi only describes communications functions
wow,not_removed,draws out timeline on graph with footnotes to decipher the meaning to ops definition of lag
wow,not_removed,i always assumed fps lag was used as another way of saying fps drops i mean what defines lag packet loss is called lag so why cant frame loss also be called lag
wow,not_removed,apparently in this thread if you use terms incorrectly you get upvoted
wow,not_removed,dont know what that guy wrote because he deleted his comment but for some people ethernet cable is not an option while any serious gamers would never use wireless lan to play nowadays of the users wouldnt even know the difference between wireless and wired in a normal sized flat or house
wow,not_removed,with that being said i dont really have anything intelligent to add to this conversation
wow,not_removed,no need for a timeline just a bit of reading comprehension as they clearly stated it in a their reply
wow,not_removed,packet loss is not called lag but it will have similar impact on gameplay as lag
wow,not_removed,long delay high network latency lag so high ping causes lag packet loss isnt really lag but can cause lag if you have low fps there is no lag or delay involved you can have lag but still run the game with fps if you have problems with your internet line you can have fps and use one of your skills in wow but it might take three seconds before your character really executes that skill that is lag low fps isnt i also dont give a shit about the downvotes apparently people like to be wrong and hate on everyone trying to correct them
wow,not_removed,display lag means input lag not low framerate
wow,not_removed,yeah reddit community he told me im wrong fuck that guy
wow,not_removed,and download if you use them correctly never change reddit never change
wow,not_removed,okay dude you won youre technically correct you still sound like an asshole when you know what people mean and fight them about it
wow,not_removed,print screen key dont make posts showing you got a piece of loot
wow,not_removed,thank you for your submission corruptparadox it has been removed from rwow because loot achievement mount posts belong in the please post it there and dont forget your screenshot read the full httpswwwredditcomrwowwikirules if you feel this post was removed in error please
wow,not_removed,delete your cache and wtf folder and run the game again if that doesnt work it could be an addon interfering
wow,not_removed,if you had a win upgrade recently it is probably from your xbox app that is pre installed you have to switch of a specific streamer setting no clue which one

wow,not_removed,looks like nighthold scaling for small groups is not going to be addressed ever lets hope that tos will be better in this
wow,not_removed,feelsmageman
wow,not_removed,extremely surprised mages arent getting anything tbh
wow,not_removed,that vim and vigor buff is amazing for discs that are already in a good spot cant wait to arena
wow,not_removed,guess its time for pointers to vendor some ap at least its faster than deleting it
wow,not_removed,glad they buffed ilvl of high end m not the weekly
wow,not_removed,i guess balance of power isnt going to be a accountwide unlock anytime soon
wow,not_removed,another unlisted hotfix is sephuz proccing off of stun damaging effects on bosses seems to be fixed rip infernal bro for proccing sephuz
wow,not_removed,warrior duel still not fixed
wow,not_removed,what a boring patch
wow,not_removed,dos for wariors still not nerfed which is disgusting
wow,not_removed,i really hope they remove the resources for a pvp brawl seems like a nice place to put old av for people who want it but keep the current av for people who like murdering kittens
wow,not_removed,thats what we said doing entov too spoiler alert it wont be
wow,not_removed,the vast majority of fights have been biased against small groups since flex was released im actually struggling to think of a fight where its been very obviously beneficial to be in a smaller group maybe flamebenders room in brf got a little crowded in huge groups and then you get more battle rezzes in bigger groups despite losing a smaller proportion of your dps to a players death
wow,not_removed,the best part is even when you kill it in a smaller group you then realize that because only loot pieces drop for people as opposed to for that your chances of getting a specific piece of loot usually trinkets is much lower guldan for example will have of the loot pieces will always be tier leaving the other loot slot to be shared with different drops
wow,not_removed,my guild started to pug people because some fights are almost impossible in group
wow,not_removed,triiliax is downright retarded with
wow,not_removed,whats happening with mages
wow,not_removed,people complained when mages were middle of the pack in terms of damage with the right legs think blizzard leaves the entire class in the dumpster this expansion to not upset other people frost mage is bottom for the entire expansion and ive yet to see a single meaningful attempt at buffing them to be competetive
wow,not_removed,not with mythic race underway unfortunately
wow,not_removed,these are hotfixes not class balancing
wow,not_removed,i have to agree a few guildies who are significantly less geared optimally with less traits are half asleep and beat me on aoecleave which im supposed to be good at i at least dont feel like im dead weight
wow,not_removed,yep mages really doesnt feel that good for mythic progression right now its sad to see that they arent that strong even though if one have double bis
wow,not_removed,we dont need anything at the moment its way too early to call for bufs and nerfs especially when some mages are doing very good
wow,not_removed,im glad this has been added or fixed rather its about time woot
wow,not_removed,a class has multiple specs
wow,not_removed,i dont know why people are cheering for a nerf of this trinket its from the final boss of nighthold its not used in pvp if anything people should want it buffed for other classes and maybe kept as is for warriors
wow,not_removed,it is nerfed it respects the global cooldown now there is even a bug becuase of it making it even worse there is about a delay before and after using it so you lose of dps in your burst window
wow,not_removed,if old av came back i would have absolutely no life back to spending hours upon hours in a stalemate
wow,not_removed,dont make me sad with truth man
wow,not_removed,im not calling to make it easy just for the mechanics to make some sense you can faceroll it on normal but heroic nighthold is full of funny moments there are more cakes and feasts on trilliax then you raid can eat augur will double cast fel ejection icy ejection on some people guldan will cast three chains independently of raid size just fun
wow,not_removed,star auger was honestly easier as a group than our regular plus thats about it we got stuck on guldan as a low number for sure
wow,not_removed,helya
wow,not_removed,almost impossible yep bet that is the problem
wow,not_removed,nothing frost mage
wow,not_removed,didnt they buff like all of frosts abilities by or something obviously didnt work but i thought they at least tried
wow,not_removed,uhhh in frost was the best single target dps spec in the game better than spriest just no one played it
wow,not_removed,because not only are mages bottom most top guilds arent even bringing them to fights not to mention fire is balanced around bracers which is a st dmg increase over no bracers so imagine a mage in a top tier raiding guild without bracers trying to compete when their class is already at the very bottom then subtract from that
wow,not_removed,because when you have purpose and cant spec into something else useful you should have at least one talent tree that can dps better than most classes
wow,not_removed,ah didnt know they buffed them a bit a week ago under hotfixes
wow,not_removed,downvoted by the ones thats not doing very good xd
wow,not_removed,lots of people are in multiple specs
wow,not_removed,people got used to legion giving shit tier trinkets now they give one that is more or less of someones total dps in a pull and everyone loses their minds its like no one remembers things like the hfc trinket that saved up all the damage you did and after a few seconds it instantly exploded in an aoe there were videos of rogues killing multiboxed chararcters this way
wow,not_removed,guldans chain deal less dammage so you need less people to soak we killed him the first time using a small group with only our better players coulndt kill him at killed him at easily
wow,not_removed,dont forget about aluriel spawning more add with people than with people on man you get add per dps on its add per dps
wow,not_removed,i can see guldan getting hotfix nerfed eventually like taint on helya
wow,not_removed,we found botanist easier too
wow,not_removed,with our current gear man aluriel was impossible we are avg ilvl and there was no way wed kill all adds before next adds spawned with higher gerar sure but at that point wed outgear normal so whats the point of doing it we pugged more heal and dpses ilvl and idk if there were even additional adds we didnt change anything and adds died seconds before next wave every time edit i double checked its frost adds and arcane adds regardless of raid size the difference between is dpsadd and dpsadd for frost and and dpsadd is even bigger than i thought
wow,not_removed,that is a lot of points below zero freeze mage
wow,not_removed,my alt is a fire mage i have been enjoying it quite a bit but i havent tried frost at all arcane is a fun but fire is awesome for pvp i have been loving it
wow,not_removed,the problems with frost are entirely mechanical and straight damage buffs are never going to solve them
wow,not_removed,they buffed frosts abilities by like
wow,not_removed,i had this discussion earlier we are at a point now where not only is having the bracers mandatory having them proc is also mandatory we experienced dps variants from pull to pull depending on bracer procs i had one pull where for seconds the only thing i cast was pyros and fireblasts i was still above dps into the fight the next pull no bracers procs and dps so not only do we have to be lucky enough to get the bracers you need to kill the boss on that one god rng parse where they proc back to back times
wow,not_removed,serenity brought two fire mages to elisandre and to several other fights
wow,not_removed,the fire mage in our guild is usually top dps and its a top guild on stormreaver a pretty big raiding realm top world guild
wow,not_removed,the head does more damage in most of the fights in nh but you are still boned if you have shitty legs
wow,not_removed,i never said they didnt i simply said these are not class balancing notes
wow,not_removed,there is class balance hotfix and spell hotfix and bugs hotfix and much more i am still waiting for hotfixes hotfix but what they did so far with is very close to that
wow,not_removed,as someone else said you can probebly expect to see some buffs when the mythic race is over
wow,not_removed,yeah and i dont really care to be honest im on top of the logs among mostly in my guild runs in a competitive guild there are also mages in the top spots in warcraftlogs in pretty much every mythic nh fight the difference is never more than tops but yeah if people just wanna cry be my guest
wow,not_removed,lots there are a good number of people with spec at but having all specs at traits
wow,not_removed,no way i have been farming a lot to get to and then i am only in my off specs i am not even sure that someone is in all speccs but if some people are they are certainly not many
wow,not_removed,also some people dont care about offspecs
wow,not_removed,or the mannoroth trinket for arcane mages
wow,not_removed,i remember blizzard nerfing convergence of fates for ret because of insane synergy and now still no nerfs to dos the double standard is infuriating and im sure is the reason why people want the trinket to be nerfed
wow,not_removed,how many people soak at
wow,not_removed,i think the bigger issue is your item level not your raid size you dont overgear the content so of course its moderately difficult for you normal drops gear which means pretty much everything will be an upgrade for you and the fights are tuned at slightly above or at your gear level
wow,not_removed,my guild is in the same boat our avg ilvl is around and we run about raiders spellblade is giving us such a hard time to the point that we skipped her after working on her for a hour and killed krosus and tich it really sucks that there is no real scaling other than hp
wow,not_removed,my group manned aluriel our first kill our tanks were but our highest dps was lowest ilvl doesnt mean much join any pug and youll see doing sub
wow,not_removed,you should be in normal nh not heroic with that ilvl like the other person said you will be getting a lot of upgrades from normal
wow,not_removed,i remember back in mop they were blown away by fire and arcane purely because of frost not scaling with ilvl very well why do they suck so bad at balancing frost mage with gear d
wow,not_removed,marksman hunter feels on the dps variance per fight god that spec has a retarded amount of rng
wow,not_removed,top on your server is a pretty large sample size lol whats your us or world rank lol
wow,not_removed,top guild isnt exactly top tier id assume the rest of your dps are pretty bad players and that the fire mage definitely has bracers
wow,not_removed,a top guild on a server is not a proper representation on how a class is performing a top world guild even less so i have of the good fire legendaries and usually put up ilvl bracket parses of fire mage parses have bracers of them have scorch belt have ring and have helm i get shit on by the other dps in my guild us world you said it yourself your mage is putting up top parses while the rest of you are at like thats a significant skillgearrng difference for them to be topping meters put them in a situation where people are putting up the same relative parses and they will be back at the bottom again
wow,not_removed,be correct get downvoted no class got balance changes its not like they changed every class except mages these are just bug fixes theres a difference between hotfixes that address bugs and class balancing hotfixes
wow,not_removed,more than a hundred are worldwide and some of them are since over weeks now wwwartifactpowerinfo
wow,not_removed,or blademasters easily acquired off boss
wow,not_removed,yea but the convergence trinket relies on how many times you attack ret is the fastest attacking melee dps due to crusade and convergence would have crusade be reduced you see the synergy here its not like dos reduces battle crys cd massively and vice versa
wow,not_removed,two the chained guy or even one if its à healer and he uses the extra button
wow,not_removed,killed him with yesterday it deals roughly million damaged on empowered chains as a druid tank i could solo soak my own which mean you needed to free other people with roughly people helping
wow,not_removed,just pug some more dps the adds hp scales so low with of players that it basically doesnt matter the only noticable difference is bosss hp
wow,not_removed,your highest dps were still ilvl higher than our highest dps p of our tanks is the other iirc we literary repeated the fight exact same way with more people and her with sec to spare between adds with our regular group wed start getting overlapping adds between frostfire phases which would be below i guess we would probably kill her in few more tries but getting a few more dps shouldnt just suddenly make fight trivial cakewalk e looking at that log you had people over in our group with most of us running prydazsephuz theres dps and rest usually hovers slighly abovebelow
wow,not_removed,he didnt say he was in heroic i assume he meant normal
wow,not_removed,hi from an outlaw rogue in legion
wow,not_removed,so much rng ive been kicked from groups for bad dps when the previous pulls i was higher it just happened to be a bad pull they pruned on
wow,not_removed,meanwhile my cousin has the legendary belt shoes and convergence he trueshots every seconds
wow,not_removed,world hovering around before nh now us now pre nh
wow,not_removed,eh not really if most people parse top he just parses top
wow,not_removed,all the players generally are top on fights we have on farm mage is usuallt top
wow,not_removed,hotfixes can do both
wow,not_removed,a few hotfixes ago warlocks got nerfed sooooo
wow,not_removed,thats slightly more than id have expected but then when you have a game that over million have played i guess it shouldnt be a surprise that of that group which are selfselected to enjoytolerate grinding just by way of the fact that they play wow in the first place have the time and motivation to grind ap on such a hardcore level
wow,not_removed,a hundred people is still a super small amount of the player base most players dont even have in their main weapon
wow,not_removed,hundred people arent even a drop in the bucket of players and we have the rank world ap hoarder in our guild specs with
wow,not_removed,or for strength users oh yeah ours got nerfed to shit week one and never had any interesting use not salty at all
wow,not_removed,love using this on my shaman on timewalker runs
wow,not_removed,nah dos is just a trinket that does of a warriors total damage if that isnt synergy i dont know what is
wow,not_removed,fwiw you can solo break the chains as a tank well past people we were solobreaking with a raid of this week
wow,not_removed,yes i did mean normal
wow,not_removed,like same as minewhich isnt very good top raiders mages are at the bottom look at parses
wow,not_removed,based on a cursory look at guilds on stormreaver youre in the naglfar and the mage youre talking about is plussign he has all bis legendaries and the rest of your damage is shit as expected whoever iclickfear is needs to learn how to log ffs or youre talking about vocal in supergroup one shot which is more or less the same thing but he doesnt have bis legendaries but your dps is still parsing bottom not top let me put it this way if all of your dps was parsing top percentile you would not be in a world guild your dps would be better than world guilds those mages damages are still pretty good even in respect to other players but im just explaining to you why the argument of our mage is always top is stupid
wow,not_removed,feel free to link your logs cause if you have roguesdhs parsing in the then your mage wouldnt be beating them
wow,not_removed,theres a difference between hotfixes that address bugs and class balancing hotfixes its like people dont read
wow,not_removed,there are no numbers known about the current playerbase and afaik we dont know how many copies of legion have been sold either it was a necessary change anyways because wont hit the live servers until at least late april at least thats my assumption and most players should be by now im a semi hardcore player and as a dh have only two specs anyways and my which i dont even play at all is at as well gonna hit within weeks max probably one and from there on i have to sell surely not the only one at this point
wow,not_removed,it got nerf ed so it wasnt bis for agi melees too it was still stupidly strong for strength users
wow,not_removed,crusade uptime to potential crusade uptime meaningless amirite
wow,not_removed,wtf i tried on my pally and got raped
wow,not_removed,wat all dps in top isnt world tol level at all
wow,not_removed,i said during farm it is the mage isnt lucryd if thats who you linked
wow,not_removed,like you the original statement that started all this was these are hotfixes not class balancing implying that hotfixes cant be used to balance classes while they can
wow,not_removed,we know million copies of legion were sold at launch we dont know total sales as of today afaik but million on launch day is tied for the most ever for an expansion tied with cataclysm so its safe to say legion has sold quite a few copies
wow,not_removed,most players who started when legion came out i started as hit and i am nowhwere near i am only at like on my main spec
wow,not_removed,what are we talking about the cleave trinket which was insane whenever you had more than one target or the ridiculous soul capacitor destroyer of worlds
wow,not_removed,idk where you are getting these numbers from but that is not how the trinket works
wow,not_removed,obv using a cooldown
wow,not_removed,vocal is who i mentioned in
wow,not_removed,i didnt respond to that comment nor did i say that comment was correct
wow,not_removed,that definitely but many have stopped again as well because of the grind necessity we were a group of in september two stopped in november and one barely plays anymore
wow,not_removed,i assumed you were talking about the drinking horn forgot that the cleave one got nerfed too
wow,not_removed,because thats what the person who i originally responded to said
wow,not_removed,it reduces the cd of crusade by seconds for most classes this is a set chance however if it was the same for every class haste dependent ones would get the most use out of it ofc the numbers arent exact but the point is it would get much more out of it than any other class its just designed this way in a bit of a broken way thats why its currently top for enhance and hunters because they stack a lot of haste and they get much higher uptime from it if ret had it it would have been disgusting
wow,not_removed,paladins cant really use their cd since shotr requires the target be within melee range argent defender is the only option and thats like every
wow,not_removed,when was the parse from he hasnt raided with us for a few weeks seriously because his computer died so he plays on a shitty laptop
wow,not_removed,no you said that the person who said these are hotfixes not class balancing was correct which they technically werent
wow,not_removed,yeah definitely im sort of in that boat i generally have the attitude of if something in wow is too grindy for me to be fun i simply dont do that thing i play as little as possible with the attitude of having fun as efficiently as possible sure i missed out on higher end progression since i just flat out refused to join guilds that did splitraid gear farming because i dont find maintaining multiple alts and running the same raids multiple times a week to be very fun but ive still managed to play at a pretty high level ive cleared cutting edge in of raid tiers since soo just at a slower rate since im just not interested in nolifeing the game ill log in for raids stick to guilds that raid nights a week keep it casual the problem now is that i feel like i am legitimately a detriment to my guild and am going to end up hampering progression because im simply not interested in spamming dozens of m dungeons every single week ive done that in the past i had over cms completed in mop i have no fucking interest whatsoever in repeating that experience but of course that means that while im sitting at around ilvl with basically only raid gear there are other people in my raid pushing ilvl because they have completed hundreds and hundreds of m dungeons and gotten a bunch of ridiculous titanforge rolls and have replaced mythic raid gear with gear from mans its fucking stupid and thats not even mentioning issues with ap or legendaries both of which you receive many of if youre willing to nolife mythic dungeons bottom line is that it feels shitty that mythic raiding involves more time spent doing mythic dungeons than it does actually raiding lol
wow,not_removed,disgusting like the warrior trinket doing of their total damage not saying trinket wasnt op for ret before nerfs but its just insane the double standard here
wow,not_removed,if the convergence trinket would have been let loose on the ret palas im pretty sure the dps difference between rets would have been way over if one had the trinket and the other didnt

wow,not_removed,ayyy mon i got dis
wow,not_removed,aahh aaahhhhhh
wow,not_removed,regardless of what he says broll is a pretty awesome guy lore wise he was best buds with varian i think
wow,not_removed,the arena is a true test of character
wow,not_removed,extracting fat bear liver this is what we trained for really this is it
wow,not_removed,wait who lets you do that
wow,not_removed,is there one bodyguard who isnt annoying i posted on a thread about silencing the magician in dalaran that the same option needs to be on any npc that has speech hell i would so far as turning off their text too

wow,not_removed,yeah fuck rexxar if you ever want a new pet dont fucking count on it i was leveling through stormheim and wanted one of the eagles because they look cool and i started taming it and rexxars all like lets kill the birds i even attempted to attack on eagle and tame another but rexxar wasnt having that shit he switched targets so fast fuck rexxar
wow,not_removed,i have to make sure to put rexxar away when i want to do archaeology hell mount up and refuse to get off while standing right on top of the survey marker so you cant see it also although he and misha use feign death when you do both huffer and leokk do not
wow,not_removed,i like occasionally sending the silver hand to go do the dirty work of killing alliance for me
wow,not_removed,your druid looks v cool can i ask what the transmog items you have used are
wow,not_removed,his heart belongs to thassarian though
wow,not_removed,who says that
wow,not_removed,thank you i had an idea for another already
wow,not_removed,
wow,not_removed,wait what how is the illidari cannot be stopped not the most teeth grating annoying thing in the goddamned world
wow,not_removed,i will need a drink after this
wow,not_removed,druids how can i help lets do it my vigil is eternal
wow,not_removed,the only annoying one rogue has is vanqueefs annoying less talk more action
wow,not_removed,rehgar shaman follower had broll valeera and varian as his gladiators in the arena
wow,not_removed,he wasnt talking about broll shamans have a bodyguard which buffs your ghost wolf to runspeed however the dude has equally annoying lines
wow,not_removed,to be frank wasnt rehgar an arena partner of varian as well
wow,not_removed,i just read the stormrage book the other week and hes awesome in it didnt realize he was a bodyguard in legion since i havent leveled my druid yet thats pretty awesome
wow,not_removed,rehgar earthfury hero of the storm
wow,not_removed,ive levelled death knight warlock mage and demon hunter to and the only one i didnt find annoying was koltira deathweaver millhouse is really annoying for mages but thats his character anyway run with the female bodyguard instead shade on dh is annoying because he sounds like an edgy teenager but that comes with playing the edgyclasstm
wow,not_removed,archmage modera is alright
wow,not_removed,i run celestos avalanchion mylra nobundo rehgar myself
wow,not_removed,i run nobundo rehgar avalanchion celestos and hydraxis i really like the speed boost when farming ores and herbs
wow,not_removed,and for added input i run with celestos muln mylra hydraxis and rehgar but i think muln is gonna get sidelined for avalanchion due to having too many stormstrikes and not enough lightning bolts
wow,not_removed,as you kill a bunny critter
wow,not_removed,i always figured she was yelling at the npc rather than you which was all the more hilarious when shes showing a felslate basilisk how its done
wow,not_removed,i am light incarnate
wow,not_removed,i just figured she was talking about me
wow,not_removed,you are thinking of kanrethad ebonlocke
wow,not_removed,read it with one
wow,not_removed,yeah i dont understand why we cant see it he transforms and has the bear form buff but looks the same makes me sad
wow,not_removed,thanks heres the list head warmongering gladiators headcover shoulders deadly gladiators kodohide spaulders chest leather tunic of eminent domain cloak highmountain trueshot cape shirt antisepticsoaked dressing tabard nightfallen gloves gloves of the fang legs warmages legwraps belt burning blade devotees cinch thats all i have xmogged right now
wow,not_removed,shoot his what is your desire is just a scam
wow,not_removed,sol he looks like a void guard but made out of light hes a priest bodyguard
wow,not_removed,priest elemental bodyguard
wow,not_removed,yes please the more i look at each frame the more i love whats going on the poor murloc the poor basilisk that majestic mount brolls expression you know i dont think hes really a druid he never shapeshifts maybe hes just a guy with thing for bear paws
wow,not_removed,let me introduce you to mylune from the druid order hall is there trouble
wow,not_removed,nah i understand that i think i heard a hoardies bodyguard say that line today
wow,not_removed,and that dude was also the dude who basically owned broll varian and valeera as gladiators
wow,not_removed,na he owned varian valeera varian and b roll was his slave
wow,not_removed,stormrage book where can one acquire this
wow,not_removed,meatball for the win bodyguard with no voice lines all you need to do is be able to accept a grill with a vinilla model following you around hes actually really good he does like dps and gives you damage buffs and sometimes instant kill things
wow,not_removed,i kind of am partial to rittsyn flamescowl and his i will leave but cinders
wow,not_removed,modera is bae
wow,not_removed,i fight for the light
wow,not_removed,that i am fuck names in general but fuck names in this game in general
wow,not_removed,to stupid for that
wow,not_removed,shaman have that problem with rehgar i thought it was unique
wow,not_removed,i dont think you want to see the horror of brolls bear form
wow,not_removed,or when he runs like yards away to aggro a pack of mobs you arent even looking at dies brings them to you respawns and takes aggro from one while youre getting pounded by the others hes super useful at times but other times hes terrible especially in surmar
wow,not_removed,thanks
wow,not_removed,you should still list what the feet are if there is a red version id mog it to keep that it matches the red belt of course and brings a nice contrast
wow,not_removed,ah thanks so much that really means a lot i made sure brolls expression was perfect my next idea was going to be around the lines of my time grinding for that one special mount finally getting it and riding it everywhere then finding a sparkly new mount and abandoning the other one might make more sense once i make it
wow,not_removed,mylune is fucking annoying i thought brightwing was too when i clicked on her multiple times in the dreamway her personality is like princess unikitty from the lego movie she acts all cute but goes insane if you click on her too much she says try that again hehe and ill rip out your heart
wow,not_removed,i wont argue with you i just cant stand silent when someone tells me that kayn sunfury isnt disruptive to their lives
wow,not_removed,looks can be deceeeeiiiviiing
wow,not_removed,its a good read
wow,not_removed,the light guides my sword
wow,not_removed,wait why
wow,not_removed,there is a belt im after for this mog i dont remember what its called by it has bright green feathers on the buckle it drops from garrosh in the siege of orgimmar i think will add feet
wow,not_removed,i like where this is going
wow,not_removed,brightwing is twisted as hell in hots when you kill someone with brightwing on your team she often says yay we sure are good at murrderr
wow,not_removed,i know he does that as a combat ally but he said adding to missions does he say anything when that happens
wow,not_removed,altruis kayn
wow,not_removed,for everyone that isnt the druid broll becomes a bear but its a messed up skin over the bear skeleton so it looks awful like a weird mutant
wow,not_removed,he screams about the illidari cannot be stopped when you add him to a mission because hes a loud rude jerk face
wow,not_removed,that cannot be stopped
wow,not_removed,i think of space mutiny relax youre in your own room
wow,not_removed,yeah im not using kayn so ive been immune
wow,not_removed,well thats cheating
wow,not_removed,theres an item from world quests that lets you give hati the appearance of another pet so you can turn him into skoll or loque but hell still be hati absolutely yes and its glorious
wow,not_removed,i want to replace hati with skoll then have another pet that isnt hati like loquenahak you can do this through appearance only part of your artifact quest rewards you with an essence swapper it applies your current pets skin to hati and yes as the other commenter said thok is tamable and easy to get to at least at when i did it solo through lfr difficulty i currently run with thok and hati changed to look like chimaeron
wow,not_removed,not just thok now that mechanical pets are coming theres also a special little scenario thing in soo that will let you tame an iron juggernaut too
wow,not_removed,thank you for your kind helpful answer
wow,not_removed,thank you for your kind helpful answer
wow,not_removed,oh yes the wonderful iron juggernaut id love to give it a shot as well thank you for your kind helpful answer
wow,not_removed,its a sort of weird little event instead of directly taming the boss you find leftover parts and paint scattered around the raid to build one in your choice of color that you can tame asmongold did a video about both of them the other day
wow,not_removed,thank you again i love asmongold he helps me a lot as well
wow,not_removed,i feel like drbear should have been the healer
wow,not_removed,youre riding on top of a hang glider in a quest
wow,not_removed,he will be when they release the raids double resto questing and dungeoning doesnt make much sense and the fiance really likes healing
wow,not_removed,goblin glider
wow,not_removed,take you straight to what
wow,not_removed,total about half way through imo but youll likely find yourself at by the time you get that dungeon
wow,not_removed,id say at its better to just do the quests when you finish the zones as you will be before you finish the last zone anyway
wow,not_removed,i did dungeon quests right when i hit and that took me to didnt even need the one at that point
wow,not_removed,as in how high level and how far into it to ding after doing the dungeons and turning the quests in
wow,not_removed,likely thanks
wow,not_removed,if you raf someone theyll have the option to upgrade for off i think once the trial account is made it should pop up somewhere
wow,not_removed,you sure i am currently using an acct and it is not popping up anywhere
wow,not_removed,anyone
wow,not_removed,if your us pm me i got codes
wow,not_removed,you think im scared of death ive done it a million times im great at it how many times have you died given that this quote was part of an episode that aired two weeks ago thats pretty damn quick
wow,not_removed,does anyone see the resemblance between the world created in westworld and wow as a game different storyline to pursue when you are there quests to take part in we playersnewcomers cant get hurt players resurrect through spirit healers while npcs dont im this close to whispering to sylvanas to remember
wow,not_removed,thats the scene spoiler ahead obviously
wow,not_removed,thats cool westworld is a sweet show
wow,not_removed,how is this show
wow,not_removed,such a gooooooooooood show
wow,not_removed,good catch
wow,not_removed,usually wow is far behind with memeage
wow,not_removed,try telling various npcs these violent delights lead to violent ends and ses what happens
wow,not_removed,fantastic
wow,not_removed,pretty darn good its hours you wont regret
wow,not_removed,i can make that feeling go away if you like
wow,not_removed,that doesnt look like anything to me
