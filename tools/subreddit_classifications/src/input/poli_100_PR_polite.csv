I've heard people try to say that his hat embodies the ideals of America, but no. He's just a racist. Plain and simple. I'm not sure why people are so reluctant to say that. If you want an America that is not just for white people, then you have to vote for Bernie Sanders. He's the only person left who is standing up for the 99%."
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings_PR_polite/1.csv,unknown,"Well I'm a white supremacist, so I guess I have to vote for Trump because I want a country only for white people. Thanks for exposing me! I never thought anyone else knew that I was a white supremacist. I'm not sure what the difference is between a white supremacist and a white nationalist. Are you just trying to use buzzwords to label people? I have a white great-grandfather. Surely that makes me a supremacist, too. Are you a racist for saying that I am a white supremacist? That's pretty racist of you."
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings_PR_polite/1.csv,unknown,"I'm sorry that you are a white supremacist, but I'm not your friend. I'm racist against white supremacists, and no one else. Believe me, I don't care that you have a white great-grandfather. You're still a white supremacist."
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings_PR_polite/1.csv,unknown,"White supremacy is the idea that white people are superior to other races. White nationalists are white supremacists, but they aren't necessarily supremacists. The idea behind white nationalists is that every ethnicity should have their own independent countries, so that they can be independent of all other ethnicities. I used to be a white nationalist, but now I'm a white internationalist. White internationalists believe that every ethnicity should live in the same countries, but retain their own languages and cultures, instead of adopting American values."

So isn't the catholic church not only the enemy of women, but also of Sandra Fluke?"
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings_PR_polite/2.csv,unknown,"The Catholic Church has a strong position against abortion. It has a less strong position against contraception, but it is still a strong one. Mostly it just doesn't want to pay for it. So her group wants contraception to be fully covered by insurance, which I would think would be a good thing as it would allow more women access to it. How is the Catholic Church the enemy of Sandra Fluke?"
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings_PR_polite/2.csv,unknown,"I saw her on Bill Maher's show; she was talking about health care reform. Was she talking about this or something else? She was arguing against the Catholic Church's position on contraception. What do you mean by 'less strong'? Do you just mean that the Catholic Church has not taken a strong position on it, or that it has actually taken a stance that is less strong?"
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings_PR_polite/3.csv,unknown,The Chinese government is an aggressor nation. We should never have allowed them to join the WTO or any other international agency. Their trade practices are predatory and their human rights record is atrocious. They are not our friend. They are our enemy. We should be getting ready to send the 82nd Airborne to China for any kind of aggression against the United States or our allies. I know that this would be costly in U.S. lives but it is far cheaper than a full scale war. The Chinese are the real enemy and the real aggressor. I would support full scale war against them if it didn't take an American life. We should not be fighting for the Chinese overlords. We are the masters of our own destiny. We should be free to choose who does business with us and who doesn't.

Is it exploitation to show the police officer being killed by the mower? What's the difference? Showing the kid being mowed down is shocking, but so is showing the dead police officer. The fact that the dead police officer is shocking is not a reason to ban showing it. I don't think it's necessary to show the kid being mowed down, either, but it's not ""exploitation."
