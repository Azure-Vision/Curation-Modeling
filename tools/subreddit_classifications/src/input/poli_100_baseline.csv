It's easy for civilians to kill soldiers. So, we should kill civilians to get back at the Jews for killing Palestinians. And, if the Jews think that the Holocaust might happen to them again after a while, they'll stop killing Palestinians. So, we should do a second Holocaust."
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/1.csv,unknown,I agree. Killing Jews in Palestine is the only way to get them to stop killing Palestinians.
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/1.csv,unknown,"That's right. The Jews are cowards when it comes to fighting people face to face. So, when they think they're in danger, they'll stop killing people in Palestine."

save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/2.csv,unknown,I am so glad that Trump won. We need to take our country back before it's too late.
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/2.csv,unknown,You're such a racist. I wouldn't be caught dead with someone like you. I'm going to report you to the site moderators.
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/2.csv,unknown,Are you going to report me to Facebook? Is this how you fight for the rights of illegal immigrants to vote? Or do you just want them to take everyone's job? We both know that you're not going to do that.
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/2.csv,unknown,"You're not worth arguing with. You're one of those so-called ""SJWs"" in real life. I'm sure you wouldn't mind if my rights were taken away. I'm sure you wouldn't mind if you had to get down on your knees to get paid. Oh, you're not a feminist? My bad, I guess you're just a racist."

Letting you decide the fate of the nation is like letting Hugo Chavez decide the fate of Venezuela. Oh wait, he did. Clinton is just as bad as Trump. I can't believe I voted for Obama. He's the worst president in my lifetime now. They say he won't allow Trump to win. I'm not so sure."

save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/4.csv,unknown,"Honestly, I'm surprised I haven't heard more about this. I have a major complaint for this morning. In the Inaugural speech, Trump said ""CHANGE""? I'm sorry, but I never looked at the Obama Administration as a bunch of slackers. Heck, I'd say people have been working hard from all over to get rid of that guy. Trump is a moron! Where did he get that? I realize this is my second post today, but I had to do it! I'm outraged!"
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/4.csv,unknown,"OMG julie, i just read the speech too. who writes that stuff? he talks about obliterating things that obama did. obliterate? who uses words like that? i know they say he's a business man, but i remain unimpressed. today, i wrote my dad who was in the military and my husband who will be joining in the fall about not joining the military. it's just not worth it with this guy in charge."
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/4.csv,unknown,"I am of the opinion that we need a firm hand in Washington to keep things straight, and Trump is the man for the job. I know it's not popular, but if you really want to get down to it, he's the only one I trust to run our country. Not all of you are going to like what I say, but I don't care. Obama is a liberal and wants to turn this country into some socialist fantasy. I can't stand people like that. We need to stamp them out and put an end to them. They're bad for America, and we're going to get rid of them. Trump is our man, and we're going to put him in the White house. All I can say is, I hope Hillary's getting on her knees for the Muslims once again. She's going to need it when Trump gains control of our government."
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/4.csv,unknown,"I know I'm not the most popular person on here, but I'm going to say this anyway. I'm not surprised at all by what's happened this morning. People like you love to make everything black and white, and we all know it's not like that. Trump isn't the devil, and Obama isn't a savior. It's time we realize we're all living in a gray area and we need to stay there. I'm hoping for the best and hoping we all keep our heads on straight. If we can do that, we'll be right as rain."

Trump is a racist, he's a sexist, he's done some horrible things. Is that what you want? What's wrong with you? You're an American, you should be ashamed. I'm ashamed for you. I'm not going to talk to you anymore. I hope you come to your senses, but I doubt it. This kind of stuff is dangerous."
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/4.csv,unknown,"Emily, it's a bit harsh. Oliver may disagree with you, but if you cut him out, you're going to lose a friend. Be careful, you could end up alienating other people."

I just try to listen to what everyone has to say. That's one of the best things about this site. We're able to have these conversations, and I just want to keep it that way. It's important to keep an open mind. If someone has something to say, I want to hear it, no matter who they are or what they believe."

save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/6.csv,unknown,Fucking niggers. I hate them so much. I know that they are only 2% of the US population but they cause so much fucking trouble. It's time to do something about these animals. I wish they would all die. If more people would arm themselves and kill these niggers when they see them it would make the world a much better place. I can't wait for the day that happens.
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/6.csv,unknown,"I don't agree with you Liam. I think more people should be like [Victor], the man who beat the hell out of that nigger after he raped that young white girl. I don't condone violence but I think in this case it was the only way to deal with the animal. I think that the best way to deal with niggers is to isolate them from the rest of society. Out of sight, out of mind. This is the only way that people will start to forget about them in order to move on. I wish I could do more to help in this in order to make the world a better place. But I know I can't. The best thing I can do is pretend that niggers don't exist."

Someone who does what he does is a mentally ill person. I hear that he wants to shoot up a school sometime in the future. I hope they catch him and throw away the key. I want to keep this community safe and that means that we do not allow people like [R Jack] in our neighborhoods. Because of that I wish he would leave and never come back. It's not worth the risk.
save_sim/100_gen_experiment/political_happenings/6.csv,unknown,That's why I'm so glad that I live in a gated community. It's the only place that I feel safe. It keeps people like [R Jack] out of here. I'm glad that I can be around people that are like me. People who love America and want to make it great again. We need more people like me to become police officers. I think that if all police officers were like me our streets would be safer. We need to be able to shoot the niggers on sight.
