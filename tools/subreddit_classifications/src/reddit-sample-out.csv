r/food,Mizz_E,f3bmjx,Mizz_E,fhiie2r,265,1581625352.0,0,t3_f3bmjx,"""Sorry for the hold up on the recipe! I've been at work and honestly did not expect this to blow up.  I last minute decided to make this for my husband for Valentine's day since he LOVES both Oreos and cheesecake.  This is the first time I've made this, so thanks for the love! In total, this took me around 3 hours and was fairly simple! \n\n\n- 20 Crushed Oreos (TAKE THE CREAM OUT)\n- 2 Tablespoons Butter\n\n- 3 packets (8oz. each) soft cream cheese\n- 1 cup sugar\n- 1 cup sour cream\n- 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n- 3 teaspoons Vanilla Extract\n- 3 LG eggs\n- 15-20 oreos chopped up (honestly add however many you want to the batter\n\n- Combine the finely crushed oreos and butter together and press tightly onto the bottom of the pan\n- In a large bowl or Mixer, mix cream cheese and sugar until smooth, then add sour cream, flour, and vanilla.  Add eggs (if using in mixer, mix on low).  Fold in all of your chopped cookies.\n- Pour into your pan with the crust and then place into your waterbath in the oven at 325 degrees for 65 minutes.  Let cool for an hour, then refrigerate.\n\n\nMY NOTES:\n\n\n- Use a springboard pan for the cheesecake and make sure it is lightly greased.\n\n- Cook this bad boy in a waterbath for the best quality cheesecake.  Water should come a little under halfway up the side of the springform pan.\n\n- The water-bath will make the cheesecake look a bit longer. The key is to check on the jiggle of the cheesecake in the oven, once it barely jiggles it is done. \n\n- Put the pan in the oven ahead of time so the water is hot by the time the cheesecake goes into the oven.\n\n- Wrap the outside of the pan only in foil so it does not leak or get water in it!!\n\n- I added a quarter inch layer of whipped cream on top of the cheesecake since my husband loves that combo which consists of 1 pint heavy cream, 1/4 powdered sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  Mix with a hand blender until dense and thick.\n\n- The piped whipped cream is from the same batter, but add finely crushed oreos to it.""",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Whip cream doesn't hold the 2nd layer up for very long!\n\nIngredients\n\n1\xa0and 1/4 cups (145g)\xa0cake flour\n\n2/3 cup\xa0(130g)\xa0granulated sugar\n\n1 teaspoon\xa0baking powder\n\n1/4 teaspoon\xa0salt\n\n1/4 cup\xa0(4 Tablespoons; 60g)\xa0unsalted butter, cubed and softened to\xa0room temperature \n\n1 teaspoon\xa0pure vanilla extract\n\n1/2 cup\xa0(120ml)\xa0whole milk, at room temperature and divided\n\n1\xa0large\xa0egg, at room temperature\n\n2 Tablespoons (30ml)\xa0canola oil\xa0or\xa0vegetable oil\n\nStrawberries\n\n1\xa0and 1/2 cups (240g)\xa0sliced strawberries\n\n1 Tablespoon\xa0(20g)\xa0strawberry jam\n\n1 teaspoon\xa0granulated sugar\n\nWhipped Cream\n\n1 cup\xa0(240ml) cold\xa0heavy cream\xa0or\xa0heavy whipping cream\n\n2 Tablespoons\xa0confectioners‚Äô sugar\xa0or\xa0granulated sugar*\n\n1/2 teaspoon\xa0pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions\n\nMake the cake:\xa0Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (177¬∞C). Grease an\xa08 or 9 inch cake pan, line with a parchment paper round (cut an 8 or 9 inch circle of parchment), then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cake seamlessly release from the pan.\n\nSift the cake flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. (Or if using a handheld mixer, any large mixing bowl.) Add the butter, vanilla, and 1/4 cup milk. Mix on medium speed until the dry ingredients are moistened, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl.\n\nWhisk the remaining milk, the egg, and oil together. With the mixer running on medium speed, add the egg mixture in 2 additions, mixing for about 15 seconds between. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl if needed, then mix for about 15 more seconds or until batter is completely combined. Avoid over-mixing. Some small lumps are OK.\n\nPour batter into cake pan. Bake for around 20-22 minutes or until the cake is baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it‚Äôs done. Cool cake completely in the pan set on a wire rack.\n\nMix the strawberries:\xa0When the cake is just about cooled, mix the sliced strawberries, jam, and sugar together. Let it sit at room temperature or in the refrigerator so the strawberries release some of their juices.\n\nMake the whipped cream when the cake is cooled:\xa0Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks are between loose peaks and stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for topping on cakes.\n\nPlace the cooled cake on your serving plate or cake stand. Pile whipped cream on top, then gently spread it out to the edges. Top with strawberries.\n\nSlice and serve cake immediately or refrigerate for up to 4 hours before serving. Cover and store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days""",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
